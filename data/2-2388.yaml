    a marathon, fail to make it to the start line, let alone finish the race. Estimates
    of the number of *non-starters,* as a percentage of those who begin their marathon
    journey, can vary from [15](https://www.runtri.com/2012/03/boston-marathon-entrants-dns-did-not.html)%

    practical matter, since our runners ran about 3 times a week, then we will find
    gaps of ≤4 consecutive days per week in training, depending on how training days

    graph C. Early disruptions were more common than late disruptions (regardless
    of duration), suggesting that runners were less likely to experience training
    disruptions as they got closer to race day. One explanation for this could be
    that, as runners approach race day, they become more committed and less willing
    to sacrifice their training efforts unless they have to. However, it must also
    be acknowledged that, because our dataset excluded runners who failed to complete
    their training, these runners may be biased toward late disruptions. In other
    words, the drop-out rate for runners experiencing late disruptions might be higher
    than for early disruptions. For example, there may not be sufficient time to recover
    from a late injury, compared with the same injury if it happened early in training.
    Thus, this analysis may have underestimated the proportion of runners experiencing
    late disruptions because at least some of these runners will not have made it
    to the start line. That being said, it is unlikely that this effect would fully
    explain the large relative differences (35%-60%) between the proportions of runners
    experiencing early and late disruptions.

  zh: 当我们考虑中断时机时，情况有所不同，见图C。早期的中断比晚期中断更为常见（无论时长如何），这表明跑者在接近比赛日时，经历训练中断的可能性较低。一个解释可能是，随着比赛日的临近，跑者变得更加投入，不愿意牺牲训练，除非必须。然而，也必须承认，由于我们的数据集排除了未完成训练的跑者，这些跑者可能倾向于晚期中断。换句话说，经历晚期中断的跑者的退赛率可能高于早期中断的跑者。例如，晚期受伤可能没有足够的时间恢复，而如果受伤发生在训练早期则可能会有所不同。因此，这种分析可能低估了经历晚期中断的跑者的比例，因为至少有一些跑者可能未能到达起跑线。尽管如此，这种效应不太可能完全解释跑者经历早期和晚期中断之间的相对差异（35%-60%）。

    two weeks of training will have its toll on performance, especially if the two
    weeks were missed during peak training when runners are getting used to some very

  zh: 接下来，我们关注了那些至少跑过2场马拉松的跑者，其中一段训练历史受到干扰而另一段则未受干扰；这产生了一组包含43,933名跑者（83.39% 男性和26.61%
    女性）的数据，这些跑者都有受到干扰和未受干扰的训练历史。
- en: Then, we compared the finish times of the disrupted marathons (marathons associated
    with disrupted training) with the corresponding finish times of undisrupted marathons,
    on a runner-by-runner basis. And we estimated the “*cost of disruption”* based
    on the relative difference between these two finish times. For example, if the
    finish time of a disrupted marathon was 244 mins and the finish time of a recent
    undisrupted marathon (by the same runner) was 235 mins, then this 9-minute slowdown
    represents a 3.8% disruption cost when converted to a percentage of the undisrupted
    finish time.

  zh: 然后，我们将干扰马拉松（与干扰训练相关的马拉松）的完成时间与相应的未干扰马拉松的完成时间逐一比较。我们根据这两个完成时间之间的相对差异估算了“*干扰成本*”。例如，如果一个干扰马拉松的完成时间为244分钟，而同一跑者最近的未干扰马拉松完成时间为235分钟，那么这个9分钟的减慢代表了一个3.8%的干扰成本，当转换为未干扰完成时间的百分比时。
- en: Now, several other factors could explain this time difference — different courses,
    varied weather conditions, different training practices (notwithstanding the disruption),
    changes in race-day pacing or fuelling, differences in underlying fitness, altered
    tapering strategies, etc. — but the expectation is that such factors will be equally
    likely during disrupted and undisrupted training and thus become *averaged out*
    by the scale of the dataset we used.

  zh: 现在，还有其他几个因素可能解释这种时间差异——不同的路线、不同的天气条件、不同的训练方法（尽管有干扰）、比赛日的配速或补给变化、基础体能差异、调整后的恢复策略等——但预计这些因素在干扰和未干扰的训练中出现的可能性是相同的，因此通过我们使用的数据集的规模，这些因素将会*被平均化*。

- en: As we might expect, longer disruptions were associated with greater costs. In
    (A) males present with a greater disruption cost than females, for a given disruption
    duration, which was statistically significant based on disruption durations up
    to 21–27 days; incidentally, statistical significance was based on a *z-test*
    or *t-test,* as appropriate (with *p<0.01*)*,* and indicated in the graphs by
    the use of filled markers and solid lines (for more information on the statistics
    used, see the [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.1096124/full)).
    Faster runners or later disruptions were also associated with greater costs than
    slower runners or earlier disruptions; younger runners experienced a greater cost
    than older runners, although the difference was not statistically significant
    beyond 7–13 days.

  zh: 正如我们可能预期的那样，较长的中断与更大的成本相关。在（A）中，对于给定的中断持续时间，男性的中断成本高于女性，这在基于21–27天的中断持续时间的统计上是显著的；顺便提一下，统计显著性是基于*z-test*或*t-test*（适用时）（*p<0.01*），在图中用填充标记和实线表示（有关使用的统计方法的更多信息，请参见[论文](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.1096124/full)）。较快的跑者或较晚的中断也与比较慢的跑者或较早的中断更大的成本相关；年轻跑者经历的成本高于年长跑者，尽管超过7–13天的差异在统计上不显著。
- en: In (A) we can see how male runners with a 21–27 day training disruption increased
    their finish times by almost 8%; for similarly disrupted female runners, the cost
    was just over 4%. This sex difference might be due to [male runners tending to
    overestimate their ability and their tendency to run less disciplined races](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400853/pdf/fpsyg-10-00333.pdf),
    which may compound the effects of training disruptions on race day.

  zh: 在（A）中，我们可以看到，男性跑者在经历21–27天的训练中断后，完成时间增加了近8%；对于同样受中断影响的女性跑者，成本略高于4%。这种性别差异可能与[男性跑者往往高估自己的能力以及他们跑得不够有纪律的比赛倾向](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400853/pdf/fpsyg-10-00333.pdf)有关，这可能会加重训练中断对比赛日的影响。
- en: Additionally, the greatest cost differences were found between fast and slow
    runners. On average, faster runners were associated with a disruption cost of
    about 5.5% (peaking at just under 9%) compared to less than 3% on average (peaking
    at less than 4%) for slower runners. One reason for this might be that the faster
    runners included a greater proportion of males (88%), as discussed above.

  zh: 此外，最快和最慢跑者之间的成本差异最大。平均而言，较快的跑者的中断成本约为5.5%（峰值接近9%），而较慢跑者的平均成本不到3%（峰值不到4%）。其中一个原因可能是较快的跑者中男性占比更高（88%），正如上文所讨论的。
- en: Finally, before concluding, it is worth noting that in studies like this, we
    always need to be careful to avoid confusing causation and correlation. The focus
    here has been on correlation via association. Longer disruptions are associated
    with slower finish times but whether they *cause* longer finish times requires
    further work. At the very least it will be important to more carefully control
    for factors such as course and weather conditions, placing and fuelling strategies,
    training practices, or how quickly a runner returns from a break, etc. but that
    is another day’s work.

  zh: 最后，在得出结论之前，值得注意的是，在类似的研究中，我们总是需要小心避免混淆因果关系和相关性。这里的重点是通过关联性来看相关性。较长的中断与较慢的完成时间相关，但是否*导致*较长的完成时间还需要进一步的研究。至少，更仔细地控制如赛道和天气条件、位置和补给策略、训练实践，或跑者从休息中恢复的速度等因素将是重要的，但这需要另一天的工作。

  zh: 结论
- en: Marathon training does not always go smoothly. Some runners never make it to
    the start line, but those who do often experience some extended period of training
    disruption, and some may have needed to take multi-week breaks to recover from
    illness or injury.

  zh: 马拉松训练并不总是顺利进行。一些跑者可能永远无法到达起跑线，但那些能够到达的跑者通常会经历较长时间的训练中断，有些人可能需要多周的时间来恢复疾病或伤害。
- en: Fortunately, such disruptions do not have to prematurely end a runner’s marathon
    aspirations. However, long training disruptions do come at a performance cost.
    The evidence suggests that they are associated with finish times that are 2–9%
    longer than might otherwise be the case, depending on the nature of the disruption
    (duration and timing) and the type of runner (gender, age, ability) involved.

  zh: 幸运的是，这样的中断并不一定会过早终结跑者的马拉松梦想。然而，长时间的训练中断确实会带来表现上的成本。证据表明，它们与完成时间的延长有关，可能会比正常情况下长2%–9%，具体取决于中断的性质（持续时间和时机）以及跑者的类型（性别、年龄、能力）。
- en: While confirming that disruptions are associated with performance costs is not
    so surprising, quantifying these costs is useful. It can help runners better plan
    for their upcoming race day, for example. Certainly, a better understanding of
    the relationship between training disruptions and finish times should help runners
    to adjust their race goals and adapt their pacing if their training has been disrupted.
    And this will help them to make sure they get the most from their next marathon.

  zh: 虽然确认干扰与表现成本相关并不令人惊讶，但量化这些成本是有用的。例如，它可以帮助跑者更好地规划即将到来的比赛日。当然，更好地理解训练干扰与完成时间之间的关系应该能帮助跑者调整他们的比赛目标，并在训练受到干扰时调整他们的配速。这将帮助他们确保从下一个马拉松中获得最大的收益。
