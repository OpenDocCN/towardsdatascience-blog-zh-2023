    to manage a data science *team* (versus data science *projects*, a topic that
    has considerably more content). In an attempt to address that gap, I wrote my
    original post: [“What I Learned in my First Six Months as a Director of Data Science.”](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-i-learned-in-my-first-6-months-as-a-director-of-data-science-d9b7b98a48f7)
    The response was largely positive to that post, so I decided that, now that I
    have been in the role of Director of Data Science for 1 year, I would update the
    original post based on the next 6 months of my experience. Some of the learnings
    are unchanged, although I have observed new things about them or have learned
    more details about them. Others have changed in the evolving layoff situations
    in the tech world. For more background on myself and why I started writing about
    these things, please see my original article.'

    这篇文章的反馈总体上是积极的，因此我决定，在我担任数据科学总监满1年后，根据接下来的6个月的经验更新原文。一些经验教训没有改变，尽管我观察到了一些新的情况或学习到了更多细节。其他的则随着科技界裁员情况的变化而有所改变。有关我自己以及我为什么开始写这些内容的更多背景信息，请参见我的原创文章。

    conclusion to this is that data scientists still have a fair bit of job security
    in the tech world, including with the FAANG companies. Those that I have found
    that have been laid off have been quickly scooped up by other tech companies.

    has time available to do them. It does not consider that they might still be working
    in their “day job” from 9–5 and that they might have family or other obligations

    take an hour off here and there to do interviews. But what about that person whose
    activities are monitored on their company-owned computer who does not own another
    computer? They will likely not want their boss seeing them working on a coding
    challenge on the company’s dime and resources. Further, many people do not do
    their best work in such a high-pressure situation. And really, is that the type
    of environment they would be working in on a daily basis? (Side note: if these

- en: Let’s face it. We all have to sometimes sit at multiple roles at a company.
    However, if you have worked both at a tech and a non-tech company in your career,
    you know that this takes on much more meaning outside of the tech world.

  zh: 面对现实吧。我们有时不得不在公司中担任多个角色。然而，如果你在职业生涯中曾在科技公司和非科技公司工作过，你会知道，这在科技领域之外的意义更为重大。
- en: In the tech world, you frequently have the opportunity to really specialize
    in a particular discipline. For example, when I worked for one employer as a machine
    learning engineer (which, for what it is worth, meant “data scientist” in my current
    company), I started getting very involved in graph data science. It both interested
    me on a technical level and helped solve some challenges for the company. If you
    have followed my other Medium posts, you have probably noticed that they revolve
    around graphs to the point that I went to work for a time at a graph database
    company.

    Medium 上的其他文章，你可能已经注意到它们围绕图形展开，以至于我曾去一家图数据库公司工作过一段时间。
- en: That model of specializing is much more difficult to do as a data scientist
    outside of tech. The difference stems from the fact that outside of tech your
    job is to solve business problems, not create the technology to solve those problems.
    As such, you need to be a generalist, not a specialist.

- en: This goes beyond just knowing which Python packages you will need and employing
    a diverse set to solve said problems. For example, my team is very well versed
    in cloud infrastructure. This is out of necessity. We don’t have an army of infrastructure
    folks ready to help us do this. Frequently we are advising the company on what
    that infrastructure looks like. We have had to teach ourselves infosec. Is that
    great or ideal? No. But it is how the human resourcing at non-tech companies works.

    role, you must be constantly learning new things. I don’t expect everyone on my

    we were using a certain very popular cloud provider. A colleague on my team decided
    to test out whether they were allowed to spin up the absolute fanciest GPU instance
    the provider offered, just for the sake of seeing if there was a limit for us.
    They left that instance running for more than a month without using it to calculate
    a thing. The total bill was tens of thousands of dollars. Nobody cared.

    实例，只是为了看看是否存在限制。他们让那个实例运行了一个多月而没有使用它进行计算。总账单达到了几万美元。没有人关心。
- en: One of my responsibilities in my current role is to monitor budgets, particularly
    for our cloud infrastructure as well as our CI/CD pipelines, which I do on a weekly
    basis. We have a monthly budget (one that is significantly below what was spent
    on my previous story). When the budget was set it was quite realistic so we don’t
    usually have to worry about going over it, but it is there and we monitor for
    it. Sometimes we have people who don’t quite know how to manage CI/CD runner minutes,
    for example. When I see usage spike and put us in danger of going over, I ask
    the more senior members of the team to work with those working on the offending
    projects to make them more resource efficient. Like I said above, everyone is
    constantly learning.

    CI/CD 运行时分钟数不太了解的人。例如，当我看到使用量激增并且可能超支时，我会要求团队中更资深的成员与那些在有问题的项目上工作的人员合作，以提高资源使用效率。正如我上面所说，每个人都在不断学习。
- en: While this goes for our compute, it also goes for salaries. I mentioned before
    that the salaries in tech tend to be higher than in non-tech. It might seem like
    I should just be able to go to my management and get more money for salaries.
    Unfortunately, this is not the way businesses work. One of my jobs is to fight
    for my team and the best salaries I can get for them. One of their jobs is to
    keep salaries across the company fairly consistent and within the larger budget
    picture. Frequently (always?) one of those it at odds with another. When you consider
    that data scientists are frequently the highest-paid ICs in a company, it is a
    hard sell for me to go to senior management and ask for even more money for salaries.
    This is the nature of the beast.

  zh: 虽然这适用于我们的计算，但也适用于薪资。我之前提到过，科技行业的薪资通常高于非科技行业。看起来我应该能直接向管理层申请更多的薪资。不幸的是，企业的运作并非如此。我其中一个工作就是为我的团队争取尽可能好的薪资。团队中的另一个工作是保持公司内部薪资的公平一致，以及在更大的预算框架内。有时（总是？）这两者会发生冲突。考虑到数据科学家通常是公司中薪资最高的个体贡献者，去高级管理层争取更多薪资对我来说是个困难的挑战。这就是现实情况。

- en: But who is on the receiving end of those models? In my case, it is usually marketing.
    I will be the first to admit that I am not a marketer. (Although following my
    statements above about continuous learning, I am going back to school to get an
    MBA so I can learn about how marketing works.) Marketers are highly technical

  zh: 但是谁是这些模型的最终使用者？在我这种情况下，通常是营销团队。我愿意承认我不是营销人员。（尽管在我上面关于持续学习的声明之后，我正在回学校读MBA，以了解营销的工作原理。）营销人员在一个不是数据科学的领域中非常擅长技术。因此，在我当前的角色中，学习如何与他们沟通非常重要。
- en: That might seem obvious, but what does it really mean? For starters, it means
    that I cannot just throw a bunch of math and plots over the fence, and I especially
    cannot do that without explanations of what it means. I have presented at many
    data science conferences in my career and there are things that I can say there
    that I wouldn’t have to think twice about explaining. A great example of this
    are the variety of performance metrics used to evaluate models. People in marketing
    roles typically understand a term like “accuracy.” But mentioning “precision/recall,”
    “F1 scores,” or any other metrics that we consider standard will result in glossed
    over stares from them. Frankly, that is just fine and we shouldn’t expect them
    to go and get a degree in statistics to understand. We might think they should
    care, but at the end of the day they are looking to us to deliver a good model.

    分数"或其他我们认为标准的指标，他们就会一脸茫然地看着我。老实说，这很正常，我们不应该期待他们去拿个统计学学位来理解。我们可能认为他们应该关心，但归根结底，他们希望我们能提供一个好模型。
