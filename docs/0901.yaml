    women or men? Today tech recruiters are often trying to ensure diversity in IT
    and data teams to make sure that a team of 10 software engineers or data analysts

    as so big a surprise considering the [low enrollment of women into STEM study
    fields](https://www.umultirank.org/blog/In-which-European-countries-are-STEM-graduates-most-highly-recognised/)
