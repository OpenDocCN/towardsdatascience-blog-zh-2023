    role by learning the required skills and familiarising yourself with data engineering
    tools and techniques. It will be useful for beginner-level IT practitioners and
    intermediate software engineers who would like to make a career change. Through
    my years as a Head of Data Engineering for one of the most successful start-ups
    in the UK and mid-east, I learned a lot from my career and I would like to share
    this knowledge and experience with you. This is a reflection of my personal experience
    in the data engineering field I acquired over the last 12 years. I hope it will
    be useful for you.

    job where we have a chance to work with everything that touches data â€” APIs, data
    connectors, data platforms, business intelligence and dozens of data tools available
    in the market. Data engineering is closely connected with Machine learning (ML).
    You will create and deploy all sorts of data and ML pipelines.
