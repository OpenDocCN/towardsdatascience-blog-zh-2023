    sentence, made up to test the system. The picture was composed by the author from
    a screenshot of a web app written to carry out these tests, linked near the end
    of the article.

    over the content they generate becomes ever more pressing. These models, trained
    on massive amounts of text data, have the ability to generate highly convincing
    written content, from news articles to social media posts. However, without proper
    oversight, they can also produce misinformation or various kinds of harmful content.
    It is thus crucial that apps using these language models attempt to check the
    veracity of the information generated by these AI systems, in order to prevent
    the spread of false, misleading or harmful information.

    have used GPT-3 and ChatGPT quite a bit, and in doing so I have identified that
    very often they reply to questions very convincingly yet incorrectly. Indeed,
    I explored this quite deeply when GPT-3 was released, in the form of examinations
    just like those I would take to a student in a science subject:'
