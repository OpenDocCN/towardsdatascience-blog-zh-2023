  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this topic relevant? It’s no secret that data science careers are in
    high demand these days. And when you add the dimension of geospatial analysis
    to the mix, the possibilities become even more exciting. Climate change, food
    production, and transitioning to a carbon-free economy are just a few of the many
    important issues that require a deep understanding of geospatial data. By combining
    satellite and drone imagery, vector datasets, and field measurements, we can gain
    deeper insights and drive meaningful changes.

- en: While many resources are available for learning geospatial data analysis with
    Python, the field is rapidly evolving. In the past, I managed a GIS team where
    we relied heavily on software such as ArcGIS or ENVI for mapping water resources
    and conducting hydrological analyses. However, my journey with geospatial analysis
    using Python began in 2019 when I started my Ph.D. in the subject.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This week I stumbled upon the book “Python Geospatial Development.” Initially,
    I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills. Still, after
    examining the table of contents, I was surprised. Apart from GDAL (which I used
    briefly at the beginning of my journey, but quickly replaced with Rasterio), I
    hardly use any Python libraries discussed in Chapter 3 — Python Libraries for
    Geospatial Development. This disparity can be attributed to the fact that the
    book was first published in 2010, with only minor updates in 2013 and 2016\. In
    the world of computer science, that’s a long time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although GDAL is still required for installation due to its drivers, its Python
    bindings are no longer necessary and can be confusing to use (to put it mildly).
    Additionally, I’ve never heard of other libraries such as Mapnik. Furthermore,
    essential packages such as GeoPandas or XArray are not even mentioned in the book.
    Finally, the Google Earth Engine (a real game changer in this subject) didn’t
    even exist at the time of the book's publication, highlighting a common issue
    with books for practical development — they can quickly become outdated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, I’m not advocating against books. They are still important for building
    a solid foundation in a particular subject. However, to become a practical Geospatial
    Analyst, it is crucial to learn how to navigate and make sense of the vast amount
    of online information, which can be overwhelming for those new to the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data analysis with Python in 2023 and provides a quick guide on the primary skills
    and topics to focus on, as well as some tips on how to effectively navigate the
    vast amount of information available online and avoid some traps. Note that this
    guide is based on my own experience and may not necessarily fit everyone's expectations.

    vast, and it can be challenging to know where to begin. If you start searching
    the internet, you will be daunted by the amount of information, articles, and
    courses available on each subject. I know it''s overwhelming. Suddenly, you find
    yourself just zapping from one site to another and spending an entire day without
    actually learning anything. To avoid feeling daunted, focus on one topic at a

    I started was that I tried to tackle advanced topics, such as creating a virtual
    machine in the cloud to host a map server, without even understanding what Docker
    or Git were. As a result, I spent a lot of time trying to solve issues that were
    out of my reach. For example, nowadays, when I want to publish a map, I just publish
    a COG (Cloud optimized Geotiff) directly on Github (e.g., [https://cordmaur.github.io/Fastai2-Medium/occurrence_map.html](https://cordmaur.github.io/Fastai2-Medium/occurrence_map.html))
    , without the hustle of setting map servers, etc. But I only knew about COGs after
    some time studying the subject.'

    use some reasoning. It’s essential to grasp the main topics and promptly catch
    up on any important concepts that may be missing. But you should do that punctually.
    For example, suppose you are running a Machine Learning model that uses a derivative
    in the process. If you are like me, you will be tempted to search for the best
    Calculus course available, even though you had that at college for two years in
    a row. Please, don’t fall into this trap; it’s impossible to understand all underlying
    subjects deeply. Instead, perform a quick review of the topic to keep you on track.'

    science can be overwhelming and take time. If you try to learn everything in the
    "correct" sequence, you may become discouraged and give up. In this regard, I
    agree with Jeremy Howard from fast.ai, who suggests taking a top-down approach.
    This way, you can see meaningful results even if you don't fully understand everything
    that lies underneath.

    or raster datasets, for example, because everything will be abstract, and you
    will not have the tools to explore it. I know you can use QGIS or other GIS software.
    Still, it is different from opening the raw data into a **numpy** array or a **geojson**
    file and exploring it by yourself. Besides that, learning Python programming in
    the first place can open other doors that you had not imagined beforehand.

    in just 25 hours, in less than one week, and provides a quick overview of the
    language. Additionally, I’ve published four lessons of a course called ‘[**Introduction

    This book is not focused on teaching the Python language’s inner workings, such
    as creating complex functions, defining classes, inheritance, or other object-oriented
    aspects. Instead, it provides a quick overview of the main libraries, such as
    **numpy**, **pandas,** and **matplotlib,** that are essential tools for data analysis.

    a generic GIS course may result in being bombarded with information about how
    satellite data is collected, the path of light within the atmosphere, and how
    it affects sensor readings. While these subjects are important if you are doing
    research, they may not be necessary for a practical introduction to geospatial
    data analysis.
