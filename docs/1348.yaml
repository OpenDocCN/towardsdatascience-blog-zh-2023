    Why do some cities manage to withstand and overcome different challenges whereas
    others struggle with them a lot more? Or why are there hyperlocal differences
    (e.g. between neighborhoods) in a city‚Äôs resilience efforts? This multi-part story

    for future shocks (economic, environmental, social & institutional)**](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/resilient-cities.htm)**.**
    For Tirana, in particular, it‚Äôs important to understand resilience in the context
    of population change and the rapid urbanization that took place starting from
    the 1990s. Rapid urbanization can put a lot of pressure in a city‚Äôs land and service
    resources, and resilient cities are those that ensure their residents have equitable
    access to them. How have these dynamics developed over the past 30 or so years?'

    There also are more tests to conduct to test for a power law, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov.
    However we would need to make a series of assumptions to actually carry those
    out (like the values being independent of each-other). For now, let‚Äôs take a closer
    look at some of these neighborhoods.
