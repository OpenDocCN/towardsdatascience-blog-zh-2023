    I discussed the four types of questions that data analysts attempt to answer and
    ways to identify each question type. If you recall, when we ask descriptive questions,
    we attempt to acquire an understanding of something. These questions generally
    start with “what/is/does” and pertain to the current or past tense. Now, let’s
    dive into detail of the strategy on how to answer these questions.

    answers tend to provide a foundation for follow up questions. Typically, seasoned
    analysts already have a strategy (or at least some guidelines) that they use in
    order to answer descriptive questions. A more specific strategy differs based
    on the question, industry, personal preferences and knowledge, etc. However, the
    skeleton for any strategy should include the following:'

    with my peers) is an article written by [Tyler Buffington, PhD](https://medium.com/u/7f0b42637517?source=post_page-----b6c9e469b32f--------------------------------):
    [Mean or median? Choose based on the decision, not the distribution](/mean-or-median-choose-based-on-the-decision-not-the-distribution-f951215c1376).
    In this stellar review of choosing the right methodology, Tyler argues that the
    skewness of the distribution should not constitute the choice between mean or
    median as a metric for “the average.” Instead, an analyst should focus on how
    this metric will be used for inference by the decision-maker.'

    Let’s take a look at the example: “what were our sales during the second quarter
    of this year?” Our answer can be either the sum of gross sales (count of units
    sold times the price per unit) or net sales (gross sales minus discounts and promotions).
    In some situations, our decision maker may not know this difference so either
    educating them or getting clarity around how this value *will be* used should
    inform us regarding which value *to* use.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another consideration, which is a part of the intent, is the audience. If we
    are trying to answer a question that calls on us to compare distributions among
    groups, it may not be wise to show a complex visualization like a box plot to
    a decision-maker who does not know how to read box plots. A simple statistic may
    be the best alternative, especially to business partners who make hundreds of
    decisions per day and don’t have the time to review a complex chart (like C-suite
    executives, for example). On the other hand, if we want to present information
    to statistically-literate data scientists, a box plot may just be the way to go.

    the single variable is obvious — it is the sales during the second quarter of
    this year and we can easily obtain the data from the sales ledger.
  prefs: []

    be restated** such that it pertains to variables that are clear and can be represented
    with data.
  prefs: []

    care?” is “gender bias” but “gender bias” is not necessarily a data point per
    se. However, “difference in outcomes among genders” or “patient satisfaction among
    genders” are potential candidates for measures of “gender bias.” So, we can restate
    our question as “is there any difference in patient outcomes among different genders
    in our clinical patient care?”

    hired more call center representatives?” the two variables are: 1\. the time series
    (to help us infer information before and after the change) and 2\. the amount

    quantitative techniques so that we can answer the original question.
  prefs: []

    The intent of the question identifies what **the decision-maker plans to do with

    we identify them.'

    Visualization tools like bar charts or pie charts can assist with comparing groups,
    histograms and density plots can help compare distributions of values between
    two variables, line charts can help with comparisons of values in time, and scatterplots
    can help compare individual points. Descriptive statistics and statistical comparison
    tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) can be employed to compare two or more distributions

    patterns in a series (like time) or patterns among two or more variables, then

    a connection / correlation.” It’s important to note that relationships do not
    imply causation but simply try to establish a connection between variables; causation
    is addressed in diagnostic questions.'

    she also wants to establish the lateness as a KPI metric and continue to monitor
    it. Furthermore, the VP told us that she considers the “trains to run late” if
    *most* of the trains run late by over a minute.'

  prefs:

    definitely influence how we identify the goal of the question. From the intent,
    we know that the VP considers the trains to run late if *most* of the trains run
    late. So really — we only need a binary flag identifying if each train is, in
    fact, late. This is the simplest bit of information we can provide that will help
    us understand the overall train lateness and can help our decision-maker determine
    her next step.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Define the Analytical Goal:** Given that we have identified the intent and
    the variable in question, we can now define the analytical goal and select a technique.
    Since we are working with a single variable, a binary “late train” flag, we know
    that the goal of the question is to describe the variable. The intent of the question
    was to identify if *most* trains are late. Therefore, one of the techniques we
    can choose is to calculate % of all trains which ran late to determine if > 50%
    of them were late. We can relay the final information to our VP so she can decide
    on what to do next.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This strategy would differ significantly if the intent of the question or the
    audience was different. If our decision maker wanted to understand the distribution
    of train lateness, we should have chosen to select the difference in train actual
    and expected arrival times and select a visual technique like a histogram to communicate
    the distribution of train lateness.
