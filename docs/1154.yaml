- en: Last Tuesday, I received from the Future of Life Institute an email asking me
    to sign a [petition to pause giant AI experiments](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/?utm_source=pocket_saves).
    When I signed the letter, the organizers asked us to keep it confidential until
    its publication moment arrived. At that time, I didn’t expect it to raise so much
    news, comments, articles, and more.

    one from Argentina and the other one from Mexico, to participate in their live
    programs and give my opinion there.

    letter I disagree with, so in this post, I want to make the record straight and
    give the reasons for and against the letter. I encourage you to read the letter
    itself as well; it’s not that long.

    about Artificial Intelligence in general; it’s about the recent development and
    release of what’s been called “Generative AI” or GenAI for short.
