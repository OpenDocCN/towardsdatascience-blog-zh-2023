    who once studied philosophy, worked as nurses, or walked dogs for a living, and
    are now scraping the web, building machine learning models, and presenting data
    conclusions to C-level executives.

    transition into tech from a variety of backgrounds and the trend has appeared
    to continue into 2023\. While a non-traditional career or educational background
    can make it challenging to get into data science, it’s not impossible when you
    know how to leverage your existing skills to complement your new-found data science
    skills.

    data science from a non-traditional background. Your data science skills and past
    experience will speak for themselves, you just need to use these tips to leverage
    them into a new career in data science.

    portfolio to show that you have transferable skills from your previous experience
    that make your projects full of unique insight. Insight is everything in data
    science, which is why you need to play to your strengths when choosing projects.

    highlighting how a hospital could improve its efficiency, how doctors could use
    AI to make more accurate diagnoses, or how worsening environmental conditions
    are proportionately increasing hospital intake rates. The same thing goes if you
    were a teacher — how could more education-driven children's TV programs help children
    get a head start on the things they need to become well-rounded students?

    vital to show that you can apply what you already know to solve problems using
    data analysis. These projects should take a crack at solving problems you encountered
    while you were working (or that may have driven you to leave that position) using
    data sets, statistical analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

    a real-world problem into something that can be solved using data science.

    probability of finding missing persons can be better standardized for my area.
    I work in search and rescue, and while no two calls are the same, it’s possible
    to find correlations between the types of calls and where you can expect to find
    people. In other words, taking a very real problem that exists, breaking it down
    into its components, and determining how missing person data can be used to make
    search and rescue operations more efficient. While this may not be perfectly relevant
    to the next data science job I apply for, it will certainly show that I can solve
    a problem using my data science skills — which in the end, is all that an employer
    is looking for anyways.

    it was volunteering, whereas for others, it could be freelance work. For some
    of the writers here on Towards Data Science, they got their start by sharing their
    expertise through articles.

- en: Getting simple data science experience is a great way to get some hands-on experience
    and work on data in a real-world scenario. These may not be paid opportunities,
    but they will pay off in the future when you get hired as a data scientist.

    could predict future monthly expenses for your parents based on historical price
    data. Or, it could look like doing a customer analysis for a local online business
    and helping them market their highest-performing products. Or, it could look like
    building a dashboard for a social media marketer to determine how client enrollment
    coincides with Google search trends. If you really want to leverage your non-traditional
    background, seek out data-related experience in that field and demonstrate how
    your practical skills in the industry, coupled with your newfound technical skills
    in data science, help you produce even more insight than you might have with just
    one skillset.
  prefs: []

- en: Whatever the case, you should look to complete 3–4 simple, real-world projects
    that show potential employers that you’ve got the technical skills they need (and
    the non-traditional background to provide greater insight than most). Most companies
    want their data scientists to hit the ground running (to differing degrees), so
    it’s a good idea to have the basics down by practicing through these simple projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These projects can be showcased as work or volunteer experience on your resume.
    Additionally, you should seek to get a testimonial from the person or company
    you did the project for, which could be used as a reference or as just one more
    reason why a company should hire you. Most importantly of all, these simple experiences
    show employers that your non-traditional background is complementary to your abilities
    as a data scientist.

    a career in tech. It was a great talking point with potential employers and gave
    them a great idea of my skills, both technical and transferable. By showing them
    that I had worked as part of a team to create a tangible result for a large client
    company, they could have confidence that I would deliver the same results with
    “real-life” work. Furthermore, while the work wasn’t completely related to the
    job, it showed that I had transferable skills and increased insight thanks to
    my less traditional background.

    looking for jobs outside of academia is that you have numerous transferable skills
    from whatever educational or occupational background you have. While it may not
    seem like it, think about it for a second.

    you are highly organized, detail-oriented, a creative thinker, able to work in
    a fast-paced environment, and a problem-solver. Or, if you were a teacher, you
    are a great communicator, you can break down complex topics into simple statements,
    you are a problem-solver, and you are diligent about meeting deadlines. All of
    these skills are valued in the data science industry and should be highlighted
    profusely.

- en: What you will find at good tech companies is that they will hire a data scientist
    who has all of the essential soft skills (some of which are listed above) even
    if they don’t have a perfect technical background because they know that they
    can train for technical skills — they can’t train for soft skills.

- en: For example, I remember when the company I worked for hired a developer who
    also wanted to do some work in data science. While the developer didn’t have perfect
    data science skills, the company hired them because they knew that the person
    could work as a developer while the company trained them in relevant data science
    skills. It would then be possible for the person to transition completely into
    a data science role if the time came, or could continue working as a developer
    and get trained on the side.
