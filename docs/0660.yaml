    probability of finding missing persons can be better standardized for my area.
    I work in search and rescue, and while no two calls are the same, it’s possible
    to find correlations between the types of calls and where you can expect to find
    people. In other words, taking a very real problem that exists, breaking it down
    into its components, and determining how missing person data can be used to make
    search and rescue operations more efficient. While this may not be perfectly relevant
    to the next data science job I apply for, it will certainly show that I can solve
    a problem using my data science skills — which in the end, is all that an employer
    is looking for anyways.

- en: For example, I used my final university capstone project as an experience toward
    a career in tech. It was a great talking point with potential employers and gave
    them a great idea of my skills, both technical and transferable. By showing them
    that I had worked as part of a team to create a tangible result for a large client
    company, they could have confidence that I would deliver the same results with
    “real-life” work. Furthermore, while the work wasn’t completely related to the
