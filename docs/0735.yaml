  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Playing video games is a great distraction for me, and as I am so incredibly
    bad, I really don’t focus on the game; I just start thinking. I let my mind go
    everywhere. Mostly, I think of the things I love, like **artificial intelligence**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So while I was doing my mission on PS4 (again, I was losing, of course), I was
    thinking that **a lot** of NLP tasks like token classification, next-word predictions
    (text generation), sentiment analysis, text classification, and many other tasks
    can now basically be solved in seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, ChatGPT is a crazy-good chatbot that has been trained to answer
    questions from whatever domain in a conversational way. It can summarize text,
    answer questions, write code, do impressions, write songs, write recipes…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The trend is to build smaller, more scalable, and open-source code that can
    be used instead of ChatGPT and with a free API, so the point is not even specifically
    **ChatGPT**. The point is that there are these so-called "large language models"
    that are trained on a huge quantity of texts, and with such computational power,
    they probably overcome all the smaller approaches with smaller datasets that you
    can build on your laptop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What I mean is that if you have to summarize a text (that is not a medically
    unknown, super difficult one) or understand if a review is good or bad, there
    is no reason to develop your model because OpenAI's free model can probably do
    that in seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I was thinking, "What is a task that would require a lot of work and we can
    now do it in seconds?" Well, for example, **writing a resume.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, nobody can write a resume for us from scratch because they don’t
    know our careers, but there are services online where you can use AI to improve
    your resume. These services are usually not free, and I think that now they are
    obsolete because there is OpenAI that is indeed free and can do the job probably
    better than all the other models around unless those are Meta, Google, or Microsoft
    models. 😅
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more complete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***One fair assumption:***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, the world of HR and recruiters is a challenging one for a lot
    of reasons. For example, the job market is dynamic and it’s always evolving. AI
    works with **trained** models. This means that once the model is trained, the
    information it gets and its performance are related to a possibly outdated dataset
    it has been trained on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this reason, I would say that this model works as a **grammar check** and
    a **beautifier** of your text MORE THAN as a specialist that actually reviews
    your resume and finds a way to improve it.

  prefs: []

- en: Well…yes and no.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, I am not inviting you to submit anything different than your
    work experience which is not exactly a secret as everyone with a LinkedIn page
    can see them. If you still feel sketchy about this, remember that there is always
    the option to run my code locally, so no web app is actually used and you keep
    all the information of your CV for yourself.

    of telephone or email in a AI resume improver.

    to improve your resume.

- en: 'Building a dataset that is not biased is an extremely tricky concept as we
    could all be, somehow, in our own way **biased**: the only thing that we can try
    to do is to build a dataset that is as less biased as possible. This applies to
    this case as well. A blind and uncontrolled use of Artificial Intelligence in
    the hiring process, both in terms of hiring or building your CV, is something
    that is extremely risky as the Machine Learning decision algorithm can commit
    biased errors in all the decision stages and throughout all the parts of your
    resume. (read more [here](https://hbr.org/2019/05/all-the-ways-hiring-algorithms-can-introduce-bias))'

    use AI to generate content or optimize formatting, we need to make sure to disclose
    that in your resume**. This is something that we should all do in our jobs. Sometimes
    it is easy to forget about disclosing it properly because these technologies are
    so connected to our lives, but it is still something that needs to be reminded.
    There are also tools that can be used to see if a text is written by AI or not

    is really doing is predicting, in a fancy way, the “next word” based on billions
    of texts around the world. You know yourself better than a computer so dig in,
    enhance your positive sides, give yourself credit and **then** use a Language
    Model to improve your resume 😊
