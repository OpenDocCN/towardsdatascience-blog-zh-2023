    but producing a high-quality analysis is really only half the battle. A lot of
    impressive work never actually make it to real life and end up being “displays
    of data acumen” (at best). So how do you cross the gap between quality work and
    impactful work?

    have a consulting background), you might have heard of the term “PESTEL”. It stands
    for “Political, Economic , Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal”. This
    framework is used to understand the macro-environmental factors affecting an organization
    and to form a better perspective of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
    threats for a business.

    of your data projects, but with a twist (frameworks, after all, are tools meant
    to be adapted, not adopted wholesale). For our variant, we have Data Availability,
    Skillset, Timeframe, Organizational Readiness, and Political Environment. Each
    of these factors is like a puzzle piece in the big picture of your data project’s
    success. Understanding and aligning these elements is like tuning an engine: get
    it right, and your project will hum along beautifully; get it wrong, and you’re
    in for a bumpy ride.'

- en: That is a tautology — but for any data project, you need data. The availability
    and accessibility of relevant data are fundamental. If you find that the necessary
    data is unavailable, or if it proves impossible to obtain, your project will face
    significant challenges. It’s important not to concede defeat immediately upon
    encountering this obstacle though — you should explore other options to either
    acquire the data or identify a viable proxy (and persistence in this phase is
    key — I saw countless of projects being abandoned at this phase even though a
    suitable solution existed). But, if after a very thorough investigation you conclude
    that the data is truly unattainable and no suitable proxy exists, then it’s definitely
    a valid (and even sound) decision to reconsider the feasibility of the project.

    a niche market, but you discover that specific consumer data for this segment
    is not collected by any existing sources. Before abandoning the project, you might
    explore alternative data sources like social media trends, related market studies,
    or even conduct a targeted survey to gather approximate data. If all these efforts
    fail to yield useful data, it would then be justifiable to halt the project'

    it? It’s not just about having a handle on technical skills like SQL or Python;
    it’s equally about possessing the specific knowledge required for the type of
    analysis you’re undertaking. This becomes particularly crucial when the project’s
    requirements fall outside your usual area of expertise. For example, if your forte
    is in constructing data pipelines, but the project at hand is centered around
    sophisticated forecasting, this misalignment in skills can become a significant
    barrier. Depending on the distance between your team’s current skills and the
    ones they need to acquire, you might consider upskilling the team — which can
    also be very rewarding in the long term — provided it aligns with the project
    timeline. It’s about striking the right balance: seizing opportunities for development
    while also being realistic about the project’s timeline and priorities.'

    month, the quality of the analysis significantly improves, allowing for a more
    nuanced understanding of customer preferences, regional variations, and potential
    stock issues. Yet, extending this time to three months might only yield marginally
    more detailed insights, while delaying crucial decision-making and potentially

    the most out of data insights. It’s not just about having the data or the analysis;
    it’s about having the right structure and processes in place to act on those insights.
    In a [previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-art-of-making-quality-data-analyses-a91ea319b573),
    I discussed the importance of making your study ‘digestible’ to increase the adoption
    of insights. However, there’s an extent to which this facilitation is beyond your
    control.

    well, primarily due to its less-than-ideal location. You propose that relocating
    just a few blocks could significantly boost earnings. To prove this point, you
    collaborate with an operations team to set up a temporary ‘pop-up’ shop in the
    proposed new location. This experiment runs long enough to negate any novelty
    effect, conclusively demonstrating the potential for increased revenue. Yet, here’s
    where organizational readiness comes into play: the company is tied into a five-year
    lease at the current underperforming location, with financial subsidies and no
    suitable alternative space readily available in the desired area.'

    You need the alignment of your stakeholders with the project’s goals, but also
    on the roles and responsibilities linked to the project. At times, you’ll get
    competing interests among teams or a lack of consensus on project ownership —
    these are high risk situations for your project that you need to navigate prior
    to actually working on the project (if you don’t want several teams working in
    silos and doing the exact same thing).'

    are tasked with analyzing market trends for a new product launch. However, due
    to historical rivalries and lack of clear leadership direction, these teams operate
    in silos. Each team uses different methodologies and data sources, leading to
    conflicting conclusions. Such a scenario not only breeds mistrust in the data
    but also creates confusion at the executive level regarding which insights to
    trust and act upon. This dissonance can ultimately lead to the dismissal of valuable
    findings, underscoring the critical impact of political harmony in leveraging

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key elements we’ve discussed — Data, Skills, Time, Organizational Readiness,
    and Politics — are the gears that drive the success of any data project. Without
    the right data, even the most skilled team can’t build insights. But skills matter
    too; they turn data into meaningful analysis. Time is your canvas — too little
    and your picture is incomplete, too much and you risk losing focus. Organizational
    Readiness is about ensuring your findings don’t just sit on a shelf gathering
    dust; they need to be actionable. And let’s not forget Politics — the art of navigating
    your organization to make sure your work sees the light of day.
