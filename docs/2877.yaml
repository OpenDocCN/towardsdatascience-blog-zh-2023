    always coming up in the data science field — — a new algorithm, a new practice,
    a new concept. How should we data scientists keep current and navigate through
    this ever-changing field? In this article, I would like to share what to learn
    and how to learn continuously as someone who is self-taught in data science and
    currently works in this field.

- en: Before discussing how to learn as a data scientist continuously, it's important
    to first understand why. Learning without purpose seldom gives an actual uplift
    in skills since it’s hard to keep you motivated consistently. For me, continuous
    learning is almost a necessity at work. Encountering roadblocks at work is common
    due to the complex nature of the problems. Building something from scratch or
    improving problem-solving methods always requires extra research, reading, and
    practice. Besides, I am also a curious person and eager to learn more about the
    latest trends and cutting-edge technologies in my field. Going through my past
    projects and articles at Medium, some techniques that were cutting-edge back then
    look so outdated today. I am amazed by how fast this field is evolving, and at
    the…
