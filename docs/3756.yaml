    may collect data from individuals or households about their demographic characteristics,
    such as age, gender, and country of birth, as well as their socio-economic characteristics,
    such as income, occupation and spend. Some of these data are then aggregated by
    geographic regions and made available to the public.

    (ABS) calibrates an index called the [**Index of Economic Resources (IER)**](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia/latest-release#index-of-economic-resources-ier-)**,**
    which scores the relative socio-economic status of a geographic region using a
    range of variables sourced from the 5-yearly Census data collection.

- en: IER can be aggregated by various digital boundaries which divide Australia into
    geographic regions of different sizes. For instance, the State boundary (dashed
    line in Image 1) divides Australia into 8 States and Territories, whereas the
    [Statistical Area 1](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2901.0Chapter23002016#SA1)
    (SA1) boundary (in Image 2) divides Australia into much more granular regions,
    at times a cluster of just a number of streets.
