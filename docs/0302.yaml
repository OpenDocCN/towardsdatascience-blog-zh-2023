- en: Common myths and pitfalls on the road to implementing AI — by Babette Huisman
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By now, most companies have jumped on the AI-bandwagon. Yet, a limited number
    of initiatives seem to end as a successful implementation. According to Gartner’s
    latest AI survey, 54% of AI projects make it to production [1]. In my personal
    experience as a data science consultant, far fewer projects made it to production.
    Given that the Gartner report also mentions 40% of companies surveyed have thousands
    of models deployed, it doesn’t feel like it represents companies very well who
    are just starting with AI. Those companies suffer from insufficient knowledge
    about AI throughout all layers of their organization. One of those layers are
    the decision makers. This lack of knowledge results in poor decisions, solutions
    not meeting expectations and underestimating required effort. To help decision
    makers ask the right questions, and ultimately make good and informed decisions,
    I presented an analogy which explains some intricacies, myths and pitfalls of
    implementing AI. By sharing the analogy here I hope to help others as well. Let’s
    dive in!

    if the AI is a fitting solution for the problem you are trying to solve. Although
    it may seem an open-door, all too often stakeholders try to push for a solution
    for the sake of using a specific technology. Yes, AI has been the buzzword of
    the last decade and mountains of gold have been expected by those who master its
    implementation first. But if your solution doesn’t fit your problem, that expectation
    will never be met.

    dirt-road or off-road? Similarly you want to know how robust and fair your AI
    is. Does it perform equally well across different distributions of your data?
    Say, for different age groups, a particular category like gender, etc. Even though
    you may expect the AI to perform well across the board, recent history has shown
    us that unfortunately isn’t always the case [2]. This can have severe consequences
    for your business and the people affected by the AI’s outcome. It’s important
    to determine what your model is going to be used for and hence what its requirements
    are.

    without sufficient torque your car won’t be able to accelerate and get up to speed.
    For an AI, accuracy tells you *something* about its performance. However, when
    1 in 100 cases represents a fraud or a sick person, an AI can ‘predict’ no one
    is a fraud/sick and be 99% accurate. Such a model would be practically useless.
    Hence, it’s important to look at other performance metrics as well to obtain a
    solid understanding of how your AI will perform. For example, ‘recall’ indicates
    the percentage of actual fraud/sick persons identified correctly [3]. In this
    case, recall would have been zero, indicating the AI model isn’t performing as
    desired.

- en: Speedometer meets KPI gauge — by Babette Huisman
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you buy a car you want to check both the odometer (distance traveled
    in kilometers/miles) and navigation system. You probably want to track how many
    kilometers you drive over certain time periods and whether you’re approaching
    your goal or destination. If you drive very little, the cost of owning a car might
    not outweigh the benefit. All too often projects fail because the added benefit
    versus the cost couldn’t be quantified, leaving decision makers guessing and sometimes
    pulling the plug on an otherwise great project. So, before implementing an AI,
    you need a good understanding of the process, how that process currently performs
    and a goal to strive towards in terms of process improvement. You’ll gather data,
    define, calculate and track process KPIs, such that after implementing an AI solution
    you can monitor how much the process has improved or by what time you are estimated
    to reach a certain goal. These metrics in turn allow you to calculate if the investment
    was worth it and let decision makers make an informed decision about (dis)continuing
    the project.

- en: Just like a car, an AI needs maintenance. However, unlike a car, AI often doesn’t
    come prepackaged with a dashboard filled with warning lights and it doesn’t start
    to make funny noises either. If you do want to be notified (and you should), your
    data team needs to build its own dashboard and monitor or send out alerts when
    your AI starts showing signs of performance degradation. You could even implement
    something along the lines of a ‘periodic vehicle inspection’ your AI needs to
    pass (or certain adjustments which need to be made for it to pass inspection)
    to allow it to keep running in production. In addition, AI is a piece of software
    and like any other software product, you may want to update it with new features
    and security measures whenever they’re available.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a car you can drive to a gas station, fill it up with the correct type
    of gasoline and you’re ready to go. (or for an electric car you can quite literally
    plug it in). An AI solution needs fuel too, in the form of data. However, unlike
    a car, there aren’t many publicly available ‘gas stations’ where you can get the
    correctly processed data for your AI. You have to collect/mine the data yourself
    and then you have to build your own data-refinement factories (ETL processes,
    data pipelines, etc.). The required effort to get usable data is often underestimated.
    Bigger companies have whole teams focussed on getting data, cleaning data, improving
    data quality (preferably at the data collection level) and making sure the data
    represents reality. In addition, or most importantly, data changes over time and
    you need to continuously monitor your data pipeline and adjust your data processing
    or AI-engine to ensure it keeps receiving ‘fuel’ it can operate with.

- en: Today’s cars help make driving easier for you, but the fact that fancy cars
    have lane assist or self-driving features doesn’t mean the driver no longer needs
    to be behind the wheel! (at least for now). Similarly having an AI solution doesn’t
    mean you no longer need employees. Where possible you should employ those employees
    in a different way. Part of their work could consist of activities which add higher
    value for the company, like strategizing future goals, investing in customer relations
    or solving cases too complex for the AI. Another part of their work should consist
    of checking random samples of work done by the AI. This is called ‘human in the
    loop’ [4] and not only provides valuable feedback for the AI to learn from and
    make it more accurate. It’s also another layer of ‘security’ allowing employees
    to signal odd behaviors which might be missed by your monitoring dashboard. On
    top of that, it increases trust and adoption if employees can supervise their
    AI-colleague and continuously improve it by correcting it’s behavior. Inter observer
    reliability is key here to achieve the best results.

    how to drive. It would be detrimental for your company if, for whatever reason,
    you cannot use the AI and there’s no one left in the company who could do the
    work manually. You want the expert knowledge of these business processes to remain
    in your company and the best way to do that is by having your employees ‘supervise’
    the AI or solve the more complex cases as described above. In addition, whenever
    one of your monitoring dashboards highlights a problem, having the expert knowledge
    within your company to determine and implement the required fix is key to keep
    running your AI in production.
