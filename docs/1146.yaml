    measurement, but it’s not a “One size fits all” solution like other techniques.
    I will cover essential checkpoints for data scientists to enhance their modeling
    techniques and achieve improved results, differences between advertising reports
    and MMM, as well as the distinctions between Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) and
    MMM.'

    consumer goods, auto, and fashion industries have been working on improving MMM.
    Also, ad tech companies, such as Google and Meta, have been focusing on MMM actively
    these days since privacy regulations such as GDPR and Apple’s IDFA deprecation
    have been impacting the tracking accuracy of the digital world.

    the following checkpoints before trusting the results: Some of the ideas are inspired

    and their relationships.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, MMMs often require a minimum of two years of weekly-level data. However,
    if you don’t have that much data, daily data is also acceptable, but in that case,
    you will need to be more careful in reviewing the outliers.
  prefs:

- en: '2\. ✔️ Select appropriate input variables:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variability in input data is crucial. For example, if spending on media channel
    X remains unchanged during the entire time period, the model may struggle to determine
    its influence on sales. In such instances, it could be more beneficial to exclude
    that channelvfrom the input variables.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep factors that affect sales. For instance, if the expenditure on magazine
    X is significantly smaller compared to other ads and only temporary, it might
    be more appropriate to exclude it.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to high-variance coefficient estimates and poor attribution of sales to specific
    ad channels.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    model’s reliability may be compromised, making it difficult to assess the impact
    of these media channels.

    performance, helping businesses to allocate resources and optimize their overall
    marketing mix from a long-term perspective. In contrast, advertising reports from
    platforms like Google/Meta Ads give more granular insights into specific ads or
    campaigns, allowing for adjustments to improve short-term performance.

    aims to assign credit to different marketing touchpoints along the customer journey
    using their access logs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each method has its pros and cons. Unlike MMM, which examines the aggregated
    cost of each marketing channel, MTA offers a more granular and reliable perspective
    on the contributions of individual touchpoints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difference is the tracking of non-digital customer behavior. MTA focus
    on digital touchpoints and digital conversion, while MMM takes into account the
    costs of offline media spending and the results of offline conversions.
