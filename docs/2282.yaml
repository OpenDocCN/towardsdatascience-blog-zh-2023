- en: When writing articles for publication in academic journals, the layout and style
    of the figures are expected to conform to a predefined format. This ensures consistency
    across all of that publication's articles and that any included figures are high
    quality when printed.

- en: Python is widely used within the scientific community and provides a great way
    to create scientific plots. However, when we use matplotlib, one of the most popular
    plotting libraries within Python, the default plots are poor and need adjusting
    to ensure they meet the requirements.

- en: Changing the styles of matplotlib figures can be time-consuming, which is where
    the [scienceplots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots) library comes
    in handy. With just a few lines of code, we can instantly transform the way our
    figure looks without spending too much time working out how to change different
    parts of our figures.

- en: The [scienceplots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots) library allows
    users to create simple, informative plots similar to those found in academic journals
    and research papers. Not only that, it also sets the required DPI to 600 (for
    some styles), which is often a requirement by publications to ensure high-quality
    printed figures.
