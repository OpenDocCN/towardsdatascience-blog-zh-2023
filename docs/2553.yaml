    a series of articles about using quasi-experiments for causal inference. Briefly,
    Part 1 will explain the whys and hows of quasi-experiments, as well as the nuances
    involved when applying approaches like PSM. In Part 2, I will talk more about
    the limitations of quasi-experiments and what you should be cautious about when
    making decisions based on them. I will also propose a framework for heterogenous
    impact estimation that can help overcome extrapolation bias. In Part 3… I’m still
    not sure yet.*'

    by the positive impact on the consumer. It is thus unsurprising to hear product
    managers make all sorts of claims, such as “We are thrilled to announce that our
    latest feature launch has led to an impressive 12% increase in revenue!”
