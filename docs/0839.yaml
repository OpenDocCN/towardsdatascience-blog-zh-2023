- en: In the last few years, an increasing number of books have been banned in states
    across the United States ‚Äî with [projections of the trend accelerating](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/24/us-book-bans-streak-of-extremism)
    in 2023\. Recent book bans in [Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/19/texas-book-bans/),
    [Utah](https://www.kuer.org/education/2022-11-29/these-are-the-22-books-removed-from-utahs-alpine-school-district),
    and [Florida](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/florida-school-book-bans-teachers-confusion)
    have resulted in hundreds of books being pulled off classroom and library shelves.
    Many of these books, labeled ‚Äúsensitive materials‚Äù, are disproportionately books
    by or about LGBTQ+ people and people of color.

- en: I use a dataset of books banned in 2021-2022 and combine them with metadata
    from Google Books to examine the main topics of those books. I find that not just
    books about LGBTQ+ and sexuality are banned, but also books about Black history
    and women in science. Many of the banned books were written recently (after the
    year 2000) and targeted towards younger audiences.
