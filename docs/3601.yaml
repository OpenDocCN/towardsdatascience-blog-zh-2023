- en: Last week, I joined a team to work on a collaborative project. The team was
    already established for a few months, with several scientists working together
    on the project. For simplicity, they used to sign documents, mention colleagues
    in emails, etc. with their initials (the first letter of their first name followed
    by the first letter of their last name).

    with my initials, we realized that another person in the team had the exact same
    initials than me.

- en: This was not really an issue, as we decided that I would write my initials backward,
    that is, “SA” instead of “AS”, and the other person would keep signing with “AS”
    as usual.

    trivial anecdote came to me when the team leader claimed, in the middle of a meeting:
    “That’s very unfortunate that you two have the same initials! What are the chances
    of this happening to us?!”.'
