    ML systems are too complex to implement in an ad-hoc manner. We reviewed the ML
    project lifecycle, discussed why and how to estimate project business value, how
    to collect the requirements, and then reevaluate with a cold mind whether ML is
    truly needed. We learned how to start small and fail fast using concepts like
    “PoC” and “MVP”. And finally, we talked about the importance of design documents
    during the planning stage.
