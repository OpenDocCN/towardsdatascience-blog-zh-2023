    art lover’s mecca. It’s a lighthouse that shines a light on avant-garde paintings
    and sculptures, and since the definition of “modern art” is continually in flux,
    its collections are, too. Now, this distinguished institution is validating digital
    art.

    of AI extends beyond text generation. We live to see the human impact of our art
    — how it affects people of all ages and backgrounds on an emotional level. It’s
    a shared human experience, and a highly accessible one.

    misconceptions is that digital art in general and AI-generated art in particular
    is not legitimate artwork. Yet, even AI-generated art isn’t entirely created by
    machines. It requires a human touch. **As the visionary behind “Unsupervised,”
    Anadol creates art from raw data.** This is new in digital art. Previously, artists
    who came before him used data to follow a template to produce a facsimile of something
    that has already been created. Refik’s work is something entirely different.

    reviewing, and writing code, along with connecting directly with clients and project
    planning. It might not seem too artistic, but to date, I’ve collected more than
    three billion images to use as fuel in the AI-generated art fire. Given that my
    days are filled with the small details of coding and datasets, taking a step back
    to look at the entirety of what RAS has created is a breathtaking experience.

    this: You’ve walked into the lobby of the MoMA. It will initially seem as if you’re
    walking into any other art museum. But, if you take a look around, you’re suddenly
    struck by the sight of this gigantic screen (24’ by 24’) surrounded by people
    sitting and standing — all gazing at the exhibit.'

    mesmerizing colors and shapes. What you see depends on which chapter of the exhibit
    you’ll stumble upon when you enter the MoMA as well as real-time audio, motion
    tracking, and weather data from the lobby.

    MoMA’s collection for itself, what would it then dream about or hallucinate about?”
    By combining data from all of MoMA’s collections and extrapolating them to form
    these machine dreams, “Unsupervised” takes viewers through the history of art
    itself and projects a spotlight onto the potential future of art.

- en: Art sometimes strives to speak to broader societal issues. If you’re looking
    for one general takeaway from “Unsupervised,” it’s that the exhibit indicates
    a turning point in the legitimization of AI-generated digital art. MoMA is to
    the art world what nuclear fusion is for physicists — a sort of Holy Grail. The
    fact that MoMA chose to display this exploration of how computers process data
    — how they “think,” create, and hallucinate — serves as validation for Anadol
    and other digital artists.

    and their dreams. When you walk into the lobby of MoMA, you’ll see the diverse
    spectrum of humanity — from little children running around to older people and
    those from all walks of life — enjoying this intense communal experience. It’s
    as exciting for me to watch people watching the exhibit as it is for me to look
    at “Unsupervised” itself. I’ve seen people cry. I’ve seen expressions of joy and
    love. I’m no artist myself, but I believe it has healing qualities. I also believe
    that there is art in everything that people do everywhere if only you pay close
    enough attention to doing something well. There can even be art in writing code.

    things like tonal value rendition, perspective, symmetry, and even human anatomy.
    “Unsupervised” takes the technical aspects of art one giant leap forward by creating
    a partnership between humans and AI.

- en: RAS created “Unsupervised” with data from more than 180,000 works of art at
    MoMA. Works by Warhol, Picasso, Boccioni, and even images of Pac-Man were all
    fed into software. We then created various AI models and tested them extensively.
    After choosing the best one, we trained it to create not just a synthesis of all
    of the artwork fed into it, but something different.

    Stable Diffusion, you’d typically get a resolution of 512 by 512 pixels. The AI
    foundation we used — Nvidia’s StyleGAN — usually serves up a resolution of 1024
    by 1024\. The resolution of “Unsupervised” is 3840 by 3960, which may be the highest
    resolution for a neural network that synthesizes images. When you walk into MoMA’s
    lobby and see “Unsupervised,” you’ll understand why high resolution was important.
    It brings the art to life, making it seem almost like a living entity that could
    jump off the screen.

- en: The real-time aspect was another significant challenge to overcome. “Unsupervised”
    produces its machine hallucinations and dreams with a liquid fluidity. These machine
    hallucinations are born from synthesizing more than 180,000 pieces of art and
    they take into account real-time factors.

    of the world outside into its indoor display.'

    A camera in the ceiling of the lobby feeds data into the machine about the number
    of visitors and their motions. The machine then considers that data as it displays
    its artistic dreams.

    humans. An argument could be made that digital art involves the addition of a
    few extra technical skills to the traditional artistic process. However, I like
    to think of it as give-and-take.

- en: Digital art does indeed involve adding technical tools to artistic processes,
    such as diffusion models and prompt engineering. On the other hand, the AI itself
    eliminates some of the barriers required for entry into the artistic world. Let’s
    say that I like to draw, but I’m terrible at drawing people. AI allows me to bridge
    the gap by addressing my technical limitations.

    tools that would allow people to more easily use and interact with AI. That is

    asked if I think that AI will always require that human touch. At least for the
    time being, the answer is definitely yes. AI is great at many things, like synthesizing,
    but it lacks competency in large-scale engineering and innovation.
