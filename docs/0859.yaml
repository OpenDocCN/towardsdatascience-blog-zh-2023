- en: Math and data analysis are practically synonymous terms when you work in the
    tech industry. It’s why many people get scared away from working in analytics
    because there’s this preconceived notion that math is all the job entails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In reality, while I can’t say that there isn’t some math involved, I can tell
    you that the math you do is actually quite fun. There’s non of the theoretical
    or imaginary numbers scariness that comes with being a data scientist — instead,
    you look at practical, easily applicable mathematics to explain what happened
    and to even make simple predictions about what could happen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might even already know all of the math you’ll ever need to become a data
    analyst. Heck, I put together a [15-minute read on everything you would learn
    in an undergraduate-level statistics course](/an-undergraduate-level-introductory-statistics-course-in-15-minutes-51996bb7caf3)
    to get you started. It’s that simple.

    with absolute certainty that this data analysis learning roadmap for people who
    hate math is exactly all you need — nothing more and nothing less — to help you
    take your first steps in the data analysis field. All you need is to be open-minded
    about learning just a little bit of math and the rest will be easy. You will probably
    spend more time learning to code and how to conduct data analyses than you will
    be learning all of the math you will need for the job.

    become a data analyst, with just a bare-bones plan for the bare minimum level
    of mathematics you need to succeed in the job.

    that people looking to become data analysts should learn Python or R. I’ve changed
    my approach to this simply due to the difficulties that come with learning R (and
    because Python is widely the industry standard). If you’re learning Python as
    your first and one-and-only programming language, you have enough functionality
    at your fingertips to have a long and happy career as a data analyst.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is the easiest programming language you can pick up when first jumping
    into data analysis. It’s pretty powerful, has tons of functionality, and also
    has many applications outside of data analysis if you decide the field isn’t for
    you. It’s incredibly forgiving, gives you exactly what you ask for (almost literally,
    so it makes you good at asking the right questions), and allows you to produce
    effective analyses without having to become an expert in all of the minutiae that
    comes with programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My top tip for learning Python is to work on practice problems from Kaggle or
    Leetcode. As much as this kind of repetition may seem boring, it’s the quickest
    way to test yourself and force your brain to become accustomed to the patterns
    of programming problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But first, before you even begin to think about learning Python, you need to
    learn Excel. Why? Because Excel might be the only tool you need to become a data
    analyst.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excel (while old-fashioned to some) is still an incredibly powerful tool that
    you can use to conduct most simple data analyses that involve [summaries of company
    data as well as the establishment and simple prediction of trends](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/analyze-data-in-excel-3223aab8-f543-4fda-85ed-76bb0295ffc4).
    We all say that we will “actually” learn Excel one of these days — this is your
    sign to actually learn the ins and outs of Excel because you may find your first
    entry-level position at a small business as a data analyst because of this skill
    alone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my favorite ways to learn the hundreds of tricks built into Excel is
    to look for TikTok videos of people sharing Excel hacks. There are hundreds of
    short, bite-sized videos that can help you quickly learn all of the many shortcuts
    built into the program which can speed up your workflow and help get you more
    accustomed to the program through this form of [microlearning](https://madison13.medium.com/how-microlearning-can-help-you-improve-your-data-science-skills-in-less-than-10-minutes-per-day-6499348228d7).

- en: Finally, you will learn SQL, a language that allows you to work with data in
    a database. SQL can be a complex language to master, which is why one of my best
    tips is to create a cheat sheet for yourself as you go along. This cheat sheet
    should show you everything from the proper syntax for SQL commands to the different
    types of data joins you can create.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t have to memorize every function, but you should become familiar with
    ones like COUNT, CONCAT, TRIM, MAX/MIN, GETDATE, and CONVERT. Memorizing functions
    is a waste of your time. As I mentioned previously, make a cheat sheet highlighting
    how to use some of your most-used functions and learn how to Google the right
    questions to find the other functions instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways that I became familiar with SQL quickly was to download
    a free database and then go through it trying out all the functions and syntax
    along the way. Having a database that you can muck around in without being concerned
    about making mistakes or wrecking the database is a great way to get your hands
    dirty with the code (the best way to learn SQL in my opinion).

    time working through online courses and more time doing the actual thing. For
    example, the video I linked above is 4 hours long. This is all the time you should
    be taking in learning how to do a data analysis before creating an analysis of
    your own. You will learn more about data analysis when working on your own project
    than sitting in front of your computer following along with a video.

    or you can learn about how to make your [statistics more accurate](https://youtu.be/Zwwanld4T1w),

    if you already know some of it. The best part of becoming a data analyst is that
    you don’t *really* need to know *how* the math works (like if you were a data
    scientist) — you just need to know that it works and when to use it.
  prefs: []

- en: When I was self-teaching myself data analysis, I found that I spent the least
    amount of time learning math. Most of it was spent learning how to code and working
    on data analysis projects to fine-tune my skills. So, don’t let your hatred of
    math steer you away from what is essentially one tiny aspect of the entire job.
    When you realize that the math you’re using is extremely practical, you learn
    to enjoy using it to uncover details and answers to your questions. As long as
    you’re comfortable working with some numbers in a practical sense, like a challenge,
    and can tell a good story using data, you can become a data analyst with no issues.
