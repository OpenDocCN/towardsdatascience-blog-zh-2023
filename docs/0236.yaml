    to note how many self-taught programmers are in the workforce. Many people are
    seeking a mid-career shift, looking to supplement their expertise with the powerful
    tool of data science, or are simply interested in what all the hype is about.
    Although I went back to school for some formal education in data science, I never
    took a programming course in my undergraduate studies, and I worked in a data
    science job for 2 years before going back to school; I would definitely consider
    myself a self-taught programmer! It’s been nearly 10 years since I started my
    first research position job using Matlab and Python to explore optimization techniques
    in systems biology applications. As I’ve been thinking back, I thought I’d share
    some of the things that I tried — some that worked and some that didn’t — that
    helped me to learn programming in Python (and Matlab) and data science on-the-job.
