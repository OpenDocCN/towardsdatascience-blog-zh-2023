- en: According to CB Insight’s state of artificial intelligence [report](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2022/),
    AI-based startups have secured funding of **$15.1 billion** in the first quarter
    of 2022\. Even though this number might seem promising to many, the amount of
    funding has dropped to pre-pandemic levels. Despite pouring billions of dollars
    into artificial intelligence, many businesses are still struggling with machine
    learning adoption. There are many reasons for it and that is exactly what we will
    try to explore in this article.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your business has a change in opposing culture, it will be difficult for
    you to implement machine learning. Opposition can come from a wide variety of
    different sources. It could come from top-level executives who don’t take it seriously
    or it could come from employees who don’t want to change because they are used
    to their current systems. How you handle this opposition will decide whether your
    machine learning implementation fails or succeeds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it is coming from C-suite executives, it could be because they are reluctant
    to take risks and invest money in [machine learning projects](https://medium.com/@l2k/why-are-machine-learning-projects-so-hard-to-manage-8e9b9cf49641).
    On the flip side, if it is coming from the employees, it could be due to the fear
    of job loss. Employees see automation in general and machine learning and artificial
    intelligence in particular as an enemy instead of a friend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have identified the source, it is time to take corrective action to
    change their mindset. For instance, if it is coming from the employee‘s side,
    you should focus on convincing them that machine learning will save their time
    and make their work easier. It can automate mundane and repetitive tasks they
    hate to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the flipside, if it is coming from C-suite executives, you should make them
    visualize the return on their investment. Once they see that your machine learning
    projects can deliver exponential returns quickly, they will start supporting your
    machine learning adoption initiative instead of opposing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of making tall claims and promises, start small and take it from there.
    This will not only give you the confidence to move forward but also show the stakeholders
    that machine learning adoption can really benefit their business. Focus on quick
    wins and target low-hanging fruit first before scaling your machine-learning projects
    to other parts of the organization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say, you have jumped over the first hurdle and there is no resistance
    to change. The next obstacle would be to find the right machine learning use case
    for your business. After all, you can not implement machine learning just because
    everyone else is doing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to identify your specific machine learning use case before implementing
    it. Machine learning is a vast domain and you should be crystal clear about which
    subdomain you need to focus on. Ask yourself, whether your machine learning initiatives
    leverage computer vision, natural language processing, or robotic process automation
    capabilities of machine learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answering this question will make it easy for your business to create a clearly
    laid out strategy. Start from the most critical business function as it can help
    you prove your point. It could be computer vision-powered assembly lines or data
    analytics-powered marketing campaigns for your retail business.

    toward fixing the underlying issues. This could be process-oriented issues or
    anything else. Machine learning can help you plug in those loopholes to enhance
    your business efficiency and productivity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if your business has overcome the change resistance and use case issue?
    The next roadblock could be finding the right data to train your machine learning
    algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are as good as the data you feed to train
    them. It is highly recommended that you train your [machine learning models](/all-machine-learning-models-explained-in-6-minutes-9fe30ff6776a)
    with multiple data samples so it can cover all bases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that the outcome of machine learning algorithms is highly influenced
    by the data you use to train them. That is why it is important to use high-quality
    data which is normalized and free from all kinds of bias to get the optimal outcome
    from your machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if the data you are feeding to these machine learning models are of high
    quality, it still needs to be normalized. Data consistency across multiple data
    sources is critical as any inconsistency in data can negatively impact the final
    output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s assume that the data you are training your machine learning models on
    are high quality but low in volume, you won’t get the desired results. Machine
    learning models require a large volume of data for training. The more high quality
    data you can feed the machine learning model, the better will be the final output.
    Another benefit of the large volume of data is that it prevents machine learning
    models from a phenomenon called overfitting. Overfitting occurs when machine learning
    models master the training data to a point that it fails to generalize new data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To sum it all up, the data you are feeding to machine learning models must be
    diverse, comprehensive, normalized and high quality. The volume of data should
    also be higher so it can deliver the right solutions for real world problems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you have trained your [machine learning algorithms](/all-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-in-2022-db5b4ccdf32f)
    correctly, there is still a risk that it can deliver odd outcomes. Machine learning
    models are complex and can sometimes produce unexpected or even counterintuitive
    results. For example, a predictive model might indicate that a certain candidate
    is the best fit for a particular job, but human recruiters might disagree based
    on other factors not captured in the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you rely solely on machine learning models for decision-making, your decisions
    could have some kind of bias. As machine learning uses historical data to make
    decisions and that data could contain bias, it can also make your decisions biased.
    The worst part, these machine learning models can amplify these biases and incorporate
    them in their final output.
  prefs: []

- en: We can easily see shades of that in automated resume screening software companies
    use to identify the right candidate for a job. Harvard Business School found that
    this hiring software rejected many candidates due to strict selection criteria.
    Constant human supervision is necessary for machine learning models as it can
    sometimes give unexpected results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce the chances of unexpected results, it is imperative that you keep
    humans involved in the decision-making process instead of leaving it completely
    to machines. You can do that by including human expert reviews or allowing humans
    to interpret the final outcome of the machines.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning implementation is a resource-intensive process both from a
    financial and human resource standpoint. You not only need skilled professionals
    who have hands-on experience with machine learning implementation but you also
    need to develop a machine learning infrastructure which can be quite a resource
    intensive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only that, businesses must also invest in hardware and software that are
    capable of running machine-learning algorithms and models. Whether it is powerful
    computer systems, specialized software tools or high-level storage infrastructure,
    all of them are critical for smoother operations of machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only that, businesses must also invest time money and effort in developing
    a machine learning pipeline that is backed up by the right skillset and expertise.
    Without all this, it would be impossible for you to effectively run machine learning
    algorithms and get the best results out of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To develop a machine learning infrastructure, you need capabilities such as
    model selection, data ingestion, [data visualization](https://chartexpo.com/),
    model testing, and more. In addition to this, you need a machine-learning pipeline
    that is automated. All of this requires a lot of investment and not every business
    has the type of budget to fund those activities.
