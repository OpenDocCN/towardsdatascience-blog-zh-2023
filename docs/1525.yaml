    for data professionals. Data-related jobs are at the forefront of career websites.
    Data Analyst is a growing career that pays well, has immense value for organizations,
    and promises a balanced body of work across the data lifecycle.

- en: I started working as a healthcare data analyst about two years ago and moved
    my way up to be an analytics and reporting consultant, working with multiple tools
    and platforms that are widely used in my organization. Now, day by day, I pile
    up knowledge on specific products (within my company), striving to excel at it,
    not knowing if these tools and technologies are the ones widely used in the industry
    today. It also makes me wonder sometimes if my skills are still relevant and applicable
    if I set out to look for a new job.

    demand and supply of data analysts in the workforce. With the increasing influx
    of data analysts and similar professionals, I want to be agile and competitive
    (for if nothing more, to at least keep my job), and here’s what I am doing to
    stay relevant and be a cut above the rest.
