    the closely related field of protein design has more recently entered a new era
    of advancements through the power of deep learning. However, existing machine
    learning (ML) models for protein design have been limited in their ability to
    incorporate non-protein entities into the design process, handling only protein
    components. In our new preprint, we introduce a new deep learning model, “CARBonAra”,
    that considers any kind of molecular environment surrounding the protein, and
    as such can design proteins that bind any kind of molecule: drug-like ligands,
    cofactors, substrates, nucleic acids, or even other proteins. By leveraging a
    geometric transformer architecture from our previous ML model, CARBonAra predicts
    protein sequences from backbone scaffolds while being aware of**…'
