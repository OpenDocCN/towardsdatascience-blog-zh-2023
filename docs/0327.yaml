    which is already a well-established concept. Data sharing refers to the practice
    of opening data access to all departments, to empower each department to make
    data-driven decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is still too common for companies to jump into data-sharing initiatives without
    a proper plan, believing that simply granting increased access rights to business
    departments will be sufficient. This approach is misguided. In reality, data sharing
    is a complex undertaking that requires thoughtful planning and execution in order
    to be successful.

- en: the first rule about **data quality** is the backbone of data sharing — it’s
    a non-negotiable prerequisite. Data quality is the responsibility of data producers
    (software and data engineering teams). It is about putting good quality data in
    the hands of the data team. Without qualitative data, the data team cannot do
    its job and even less engage in data sharing with other departments. In fact,
    if the data team can’t use the data, why even bother sharing it with others?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second and third rules in this article are focused on ensuring that high-quality
    data is effectively shared with the business teams. This involves not only providing
    accurate and reliable data, but also enriching it with relevant context and making
    it easily accessible through user-friendly interfaces. By doing so, even teams
    that are less technically proficient can easily make use of the data. You can
    find a visual representation below.

    data you share with business units.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    decisions. For this to happen, you must provide them with **top-notch data**.
  prefs: []

    to significant financial losses, missed opportunities, and damage to your company’s
    reputation. More importantly, this can erode [trust](https://www.castordoc.com/blog/transparency-for-trust)
    in your data and lead to general disinterest in data. If the plan is not to share
    first-rate data, then don’t share data at all. Data sharing is an all-in or all-out
    effort. If not executed properly, it can be detrimental to your organization.

    implement **data contracts.**

    The data community has a [love-and-hate relationship with data contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BEpYAp3Qu4).

    are agreements between data producers and data consumers that outline the specific

    in ensuring data quality by setting clear expectations and guidelines for how
    the data should be handled.'

    The model’s performance depends on the accuracy of its training data, which is
    sourced from various tables within the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To ensure the model functions correctly, we expect the integrity of the data
    to be maintained at all times; this means the columns should never be removed,
    the values of each field should remain consistent, and all critical business logic
    should be upheld. If any of these conditions are not met, the model’s performance
    may be compromised.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    contract to hold data producers accountable for maintaining the integrity of the
    data.
  prefs: []

    setting clear guidelines and expectations for how data should be handled and maintained.

    the quality of the data. This way, data contracts can prevent flawed data from
    landing in the hands of operational teams.

    The next step is to ensure that context is also provided.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    context is dangerous and worthless because it is left open to interpretation by
    various teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me tell you, this is not a safe bet. Different interpretations mean different
    conclusions, and ultimately mean incoherent reporting across departments. If you’re
    going to lead business teams in uncharted territory, give them a map. Context
    is the map.

    to make sure they understand what data they’re using. People understand the data

- en: Context starts with **documentation**. All the shared data assets need to be
    documented for stakeholders to understand them. In practice, this means curating
    your data assets with column definitions, tags, owners, etc. When you document
    your data properly, people know where to find it and how to use it without having
    to reach out to someone else in the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second aspect of providing context is to have a robust **data lineage capability**.
    Data lineage is an extremely powerful transparency device. It enables people to
    understand how data assets are related. If something breaks upstream, data lineage
    allows everyone to understand what the consequences will be downstream, avoiding
    unpleasant surprises. Lineage can also assist stakeholders in identifying the
    source of data problems when they arise.

    stakeholders. This can be achieved by sharing information about how the data is
    being utilized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When people can see how their peers are using and querying the data, they are
    able to start with a stronger foundation and can learn from the insights and strategies
    of their colleagues. Social discovery allows teams to build on one another’s knowledge
    and thus work more efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, a marketing analyst who wants to perform an analysis on Marketing
    Qualified Leads (MQLs) can leverage Social Discovery to streamline the process.
    With social discovery, the analyst can quickly identify the most relevant tables
    and data sets being utilized by the rest of the marketing team. Additionally,
    he can access the queries that have been performed by the team, which can serve
    as a starting point for his analysis. This not only saves time but also allows
    the analyst to gain insights and learn from the work of his colleagues.

- en: If you’re going to share data with anyone, you have to do it through the right
    interface. Not all team members have the same level of technical expertise and
    not all teams have the same data needs. It is essential to provide the right interface
    for the right team in order to make data accessible to all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you are documenting your data in dbt, you cannot expect the marketing team
    to fetch the documentation there. Context should be made available in tools that
    are user-friendly for business teams. There are two ways to go about this:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to achieve this is by offering a tool that enables efficient **search
    and navigation**. The tool should be easy to use and understand, to ensure that
    non-technical team members are able to use it effectively. A data catalog is an
    example of such a tool that can be used to discover, understand and access data
    easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another approach to providing the right interface is by making data easily accessible
    **within the tools** that business teams already use. This approach involves delivering
    the data to the tools that are already familiar to the teams. Reverse ETL tools
    can be used for this purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By making the data findable within existing tools, teams can access the data
    they need without having to navigate new systems or learn new software. For example,
    once Lead Scoring has been calculated on top of the data warehouse, Reverse ETL
    allows for syncing this metric into salesforce. This allows sales to access it
    directly within the tools they are familiar with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter your approach, keep in mind that if you want to make your data available
    to all, you must cater to the business team’s needs. Demanding they learn the
    technical team’s tools and processes will only hinder your efforts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Providing the right interface is crucial for democratizing data and making it
    accessible to all team members. It is important to consider the technical expertise
    and data needs of different teams when deciding on the right interface. By providing
    an easy-to-use tool or shipping data to existing tools, teams can access the data
    they need to make informed decisions and drive results.
