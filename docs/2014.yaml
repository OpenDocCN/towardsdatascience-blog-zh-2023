    for the future to meet a dynamic customer demand. Companies usually rely on historical
    trends overlaid with inputs from customers, while also factoring in promotions
    or fire sales, to create a demand forecast.

    stage trickle down to other stages including supply planning, production scheduling,
    logistics planning, and inventory optimization. It is critical for the demand
    forecast to be as accurate as possible to avoid costs associated with too much
    or too little inventory. Over-forecasting can lead to excess working capital being
    tied up in inventory. On the…
