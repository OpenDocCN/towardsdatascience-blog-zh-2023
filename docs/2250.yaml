    In literature it is referenced as the **Flipped Interaction Pattern**, and I found
    it to be a very powerful framework to help in problem solving tasks. The distinct
    aspect of this prompt engineering method lies in its “reversed” (i.e. flipped)
    approach: instead of directly asking for answers or solutions from the AI, it
    p**rimarily focuses making the AI deliver the right questions that could effectively
    drive us towards our desired solution**.'
