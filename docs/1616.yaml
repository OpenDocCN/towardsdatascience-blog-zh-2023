    can serve endless needs, but in doing so, rarely do they serve *particular* needs
    perfectly. It’s the [Heisenberg uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)
    for data: the more data you expose, the less sharp your insight. Dashboards, by
    nature, prioritize data exposure. They offer data *by itself*, and interpretation
    is left to the consumer. A certain number of core dashboards are certainly required,
    of course. Every business unit has core metrics and events that it tracks, and
    these *need* to be surfaced somewhere — the dashboard here acts as the heartbeat
    of the business. But beyond this, value greatly diminishes after each [nth dashboard](https://mobile.twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1631685206053728259).'

    more precise relevance to business problems. If dashboards are like salad bars,
    analyses are made-to-order meals. And just as specific meals fit cravings better,
    so too will **analyses *always* fit specific business needs better**. On the other
    hand, incremental salad bar items (more dashboards) have diminishing returns —
    they’ll never quite satisfy a particular craving, but they’ll crudely solve most
    hunger-related problems. You can benefit greatly from having a few, but you don’t
    need to continue building them endlessly.

    time in history where dashboarding still retains its primacy. It made sense when
    data was slow, data was hard to handle, and dashboards were cumbersome to make
    — core dashboard maintenance *was* the entirety of an analyst’s job. But as the
    warehouse sped up, as analytics needs changed, as the returns on additional dashboards
    diminished, our mindset never adjusted accordingly.

    do analytics work these days, and when I recently got my first ad hoc request
    in months, I’ll admit I jumped directly into the data. I had a strong urge to
    answer the question as quickly as possible — I viewed the work as a hindrance,
    not an opportunity. It was an attempt to **diminish the work required of me**,
    but in doing so, I fell from Co-founder to human API. I fell victim to the [bad
    loop ruining analytics](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/the-bad-loop-ruining-analytics),
    even as a self-proclaimed curate of this borderline analytics religion.

    that our value add extends beyond getting data. By all means, if you believe that
    your organization’s primary need is a core set of dashboards, then set those up
    and focus your efforts on that. But if you have an inkling that you can provide
    leverage outside of this — by helping folks make better decisions, or by even
    keeping others [intellectually honest](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/analytics-is-not-about-data-its-about)
    in the conversions — then internalize this and proceed under the assumption that
    it is true.

    beyond simply *recognizing that*, the remaining hurdles are still substantial.
    In my estimation, the most debilitating hindrance henceforth is that it’s *far
    too easy to fall into bad habits.* We need to build systems that make it easy
    to do the right things and harder to do the wrong ones.

    if you’ve already invested heavily into self-service systems and a set of core
    dashboards. If we spend our IC time trying to *maximize the usefulness of our
    work* (analysis), rather than trying to *maximize the scalability of our work*
    (dashboards), it follows then that our work will end up being more useful, by
    definition.

    [Hyperquery](https://www.hyperquery.ai/) — but even if you’re not sold on our
    vision, even ensuring you don’t jump into Tableau for every analysis is a worthy
    first step. At minimum, narrative-first is a must. By simply forcing yourself
