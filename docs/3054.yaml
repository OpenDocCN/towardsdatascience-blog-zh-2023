    optimization through bio-inspired metaheuristics. He completed his PhD in computer
    science at Tulane University in 1996 and is a full professor at the computer science
    department of CINVESTAV-IPN in Mexico City. Renowned for his groundbreaking contributions,
    he boasts more than 68,000 citations and an H-index of 102, according to Google
    Scholar. Notably, he was among the top 300 most cited computer scientists in the
    2016 Shanghai Global Ranking of Academic Subjects developed by OSPHERE. Throughout
    his career. Read this article to find out how professor Coello Coello sees the
    role of multi-objective optimization amidst the many breakthroughs in Transformer-based
    models, the most important character trait for scientists and what the multi-objective
    optimization domain should do differently.

    research topic for your PhD in 1996 at Tulane University. Can you briefly tell
    me the story that led you to work on evolutionary multi-objective optimization??**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a long story, so I will try to be brief. When I got to Tulane for my
    master’s and then PhD degree in computer science, I didn’t know what topic I wanted
    to work on. I knew I didn’t want to do software engineering nor databases. Firstly,
    I tried programming languages then robotics. Both didn’t work. Accidentally, one
    day, I read a paper that used genetic algorithms to solve a structural optimization
    problem. I decided to dedicate a course assignment to this paper, developed my
    own genetic algorithm and wrote software for analysis. This got me very excited,
    as I could now see how a genetic algorithm was able to produce good solutions
    to a complex optimization problem relatively easily. This excitement for evolutionary
    algorithms has stayed my entire life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I decided to go with a robotics professor. He did not know much about evolutionary
    computing, and neither did I, but we decided we could work together. As such,
    he could not help me find a suitable topic. Professor Bill Buckles, who worked
    with evolutionary algorithms, recommended me to work with multi-objective optimization
    as not many people had been using algorithms in that domain. After looking for
    related papers, I found my PhD topic. Serendipitously, it all came together without
    being planned. I believe that many great things come together by serendipity rather
    than being planned.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a large difference between classical optimization and using evolutionary
    algorithms. Classical optimization mostly depends on math and calculus, whereas
    evolutionary algorithms are inspired by natural phenomena. It fascinates me how
    nature has adapted the species in different ways, just aiming for survival, and
    how this can be such a powerful tool to improve the mechanisms of a particular
    individual. With evolutionary algorithms, we simulate this process, albeit a coarse,
    low-quality version of what happens in nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evolutionary algorithms seem to have a simplistic framework, mirroring intricate
    natural phenomena, which paradoxically yields exceptional problem-solving capabilities.
    In my pursuit to understand why it is that they were so good, I am still puzzled.
    I have read many papers related to natural evolution. I tried to follow up a little
    bit on findings in sort of popular science magazines, not technical things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    me. If circumstances permitted — the knowledge, time, and skills — I would devote
    the rest of my career to trying to understand how they operate.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though the domain of multi-objective optimization is relatively narrow, my journey
    began in an era when opportunities were abundant due to the limited number of
    researchers. This allowed me to explore a diverse array of topics. While the landscape
    has evolved, I’ve observed that despite a proliferation of papers, a distinct
    perspective is still lacking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Researchers are somewhat hesitant to embrace challenging problems and push the
    boundaries of research topics. Additionally, we struggle to provide robust explanations
    for our methodologies. We are still not daring to go to challenging problems,
    to challenging research topics, and we are still not able to explain many of the
    things we have done. We’re well-equipped with techniques for specific problems,
    yet we lack a deeper comprehension of these techniques’ underlying principles.
    Most people focus on proposing, not on understanding. This realization has prompted
    a shift in my focus.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I believe that if no one else undertakes this task, it falls upon us to do so.
    While it’s a challenging endeavour to dissect and understand mechanisms and reasons
    behind algorithmic efficacy, I consider this pursuit essential for real scientific
    advancement. You could have only two or three methods for a problem rather than
    200\. If there is no way to classify all these methods, one cannot justify a new
    tool, and I don’t think it makes much sense to continue in this direction. Of
    course, people will keep producing, and that’s fine. But if we lack understanding,
    I think we will end up with a field with no future. Ultimately, my objective is
    to direct my efforts toward grasping existing tools before determining the need
    for novel ones.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we can assess what we really need. We should work based on the domain’s needs
    instead of the desire to have more publications. If we don’t have a tool that
    does this, then let’s work on developing it. Then, research should be moving more
    in this direction of need rather than in the direction of producing numbers.

    work?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, it’s not only about why they work. The question of why certain algorithms
    work is undoubtedly crucial, but our inquiries shouldn’t be limited to just that.
    A critical aspect to delve into is how to best match algorithms to applications.
    When presented with multiple algorithms, practitioners often grapple with deciding
    which one is optimal for a particular application, whether it’s for combinatorial
    or continuous optimization. The ambiguity lies in discerning the ideal scenarios
    for each algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, while we do not have algorithms designed for specific tasks that don’t
    require further characterization, it’s equally important to understand and perhaps
    categorize general algorithms. We should aim to extract more information about
    their operation and evaluate whether they truly are universally applicable or
    if they should be tied to specific tasks.

    crossover operators, mutation operators and archiving techniques. There is a plethora
    of all of these. Yet, only a select few are commonly used, often because they’ve
    been employed historically rather than due to an intrinsic understanding of their
    efficacy. We should be addressing questions like: “Why use one method over another?”
    It’s these broader, nuanced inquiries that our domain needs to focus on.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evolutionary algorithms initiate with a collection of solutions, usually generated
    randomly. These solutions initially possess low quality, but through the selection
    process, they gradually evolve towards the Pareto front. However, it’s important
    to note that while a Pareto front is generated, users typically don’t require
    all solutions within it. Then, a few or only one solution is selected. But selecting
    the right solution on the Pareto front is not optimization, but is instead decision
    making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'With decision-making, a subset or even a single solution is selected from the
    Pareto front based on the user’s preferences. Determining user’s preferences can
    be straightforward if they have a clear trade-off in mind, but when preferences
    are uncertain, the algorithm generates several possibilities for users to evaluate
    and select from. This diverges from optimization and delves into decision-making.
    Thus, in multi-objective optimization, there are three distinct stages: modeling,
    optimization, and decision-making.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I primarily focus on the optimization aspect. Other researchers, particularly
    in operations research, delve into decision-making, and some combine both. These
    interactive approaches involve running the optimizer for a few iterations and
    then seeking user input on the desired direction, generating solutions based on
    the user’s preferences. These interactive methods can be effective, but crafting
    concise and meaningful user queries is crucial to prevent overwhelming them.

    which you select PhDs is their passion. How do you assess passion?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, students are passionate but are also excellent programmers and mathematicians.
    Unfortunately, students with all these skills are rare, and a balance between
    these should be found. One could say this is a multi-objective optimization problem
    in itself. Passion weighs heavily compared to other traits and skills in my assessment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assessing passion can be intricate to define but more evident to recognize.
    When I encounter it, a sort of sixth sense guides me in differentiating genuine
    passion from feigned enthusiasm. One telltale sign is students who consistently
    go beyond the scope of assigned tasks, constantly exceeding expectations. However,
    this is not the sole indicator. Passionate individuals exhibit an insatiable curiosity,
    not only asking numerous questions about their topic but also independently delving
    into related areas. They bridge concepts, linking seemingly disparate elements
    to their work — an essential trait in research which involves creative connections.
    For me, this indicates a true passion for the craft. In my experience, individuals
    with an innate passion tend to exhibit an affinity for probing the depths of their
    topic, exploring facets beyond immediate instruction. Such students possess a
    research-oriented spirit, not solely seeking prescribed answers but uncovering
    avenues to enrich their understanding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final element involves leveraging and cultivating their skills. Even if
    a student excels primarily in passion, their other abilities may not be lacking.
    It’s rare to find a student embodying every desirable trait. More often, students
    excel in a particular facet while maintaining proficiency in others. For instance,
    a student might excel in passion, possess good programming skills, albeit not
    extraordinary, and demonstrate solid mathematical foundations. Striking a balance
    among these attributes constitutes a multi-objective problem, aiming to extract
    the most from a student based on their unique skill set.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Why is passion so important?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recall having a few students who were exceptional in various aspects but lacked
    that spark of passion. The work we engaged in, as a result, felt rather mundane
    and uninspiring to me. A passionate student not only strives for their own growth
    but also reignites my enthusiasm for the subject matter. They challenge me, push
    me deeper into the topic, and make the collaborative process more stimulating.
    On the other hand, a student who is merely going through the motions, focusing
    just on task completion without the drive to delve deeper, doesn’t evoke the same
    excitement. Such situations tend to become more about ticking boxes to ensure
    they graduate rather than an enriching exchange of knowledge and ideas. Simply
    put, without passion, the experience becomes transactional, devoid of the vibrancy
    that makes academic collaboration truly rewarding.

    following a research-by-analogy approach. Since there is typically little novelty
    in research by analogy, should this be conducted at universities?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The question raises a fundamental consideration: the objectives of universities
    in research endeavours. Research by analogy certainly has its place — it’s necessary,
    and over time, it has incrementally pushed the boundaries of knowledge in specific
    directions. For instance, in the context of multi-objective optimization, significant
    progress has occurred over the past 18 years, leading to the development of improved
    algorithms. This success validates the role of research by analogy.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    which could stifle the reception of truly innovative ideas. Novel ideas, when
    introduced, might face resistance within a system that largely values incremental
    work. Consequently, a harmonious coexistence between the two modes of research
    is essential. Institutions, evaluation systems, and academic journals should incentivize
    both. Research by analogy serves as a foundation for steady progress, while the
    cultivation of groundbreaking ideas drives the field forward. The coexistence
    ensures that while we build upon existing knowledge, we simultaneously embrace
    avenues leading to unforeseen territories. A future devoid of either approach
    would be less than optimal; therefore, fostering a balanced ecosystem ensures
    that the field remains vibrant, adaptive, and poised for growth.

    outcome hinges on the contributions of Associate Editors and reviewers. While
    I strive not to reject papers with novel ideas, it’s not always feasible. Unfortunately,
    I must admit that encountering papers with genuinely new concepts is becoming
    increasingly rare. Notably, this year, I reviewed a paper for a conference featuring
    an exceptionally intriguing idea that captivated me. This stands as the most remarkable
    discovery I’ve encountered in the past 15 years. However, such occurrences are

    of designing robust optimizers that can seamlessly integrate with existing algorithms,
    like Adam, to train neural networks. There have been a few endeavours in this

    the structure would resemble that of deep learning. This is a relatively uncharted
    territory, divergent from the conventional neural network approach. The potential
    benefits? Possibly it might offer more computational efficiency or even heightened
    accuracy. But the real advantage remains to be explored.

    not a widespread application. Genetic programming has often been harnessed more
    for building heuristics, especially hyper heuristics pertinent to combinatorial

    stems from the computational costs involved. Yet, I’m hopeful that with time and
    technological progression, we’ll see a shift.

    in neural networks. Beyond merely pinpointing these weaknesses, there’s an opportunity
