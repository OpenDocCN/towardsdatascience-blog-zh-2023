- en: Manual document labeling is a time-consuming and tedious process that often
    requires significant resources and can be prone to errors. However, recent advancements
    in machine learning, particularly the technique known as few-shot learning, are
    making it easier to automate the labeling process. Large Language Models (LLMs)
    in particular are excellent few shot learners thanks for their emergent capability
    in context learning.

- en: In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how few-shot learning is transforming
    document labeling, specifically for Named Entity Recognition which is the most
    important task in document processing. We will show how the [UBIAI](https://ubiai.tools)’s
    platform is making it easier than ever to automate this critical task using few
    shot labeling techniques.

- en: 'Few-shot learning is a machine learning technique that enables models to learn
    a given task with only a few labeled examples. Without modifying its weights,
    the model can be tuned to perform a specific task by including concatenated training
    examples of these tasks in its input and asking the model to predict the output
    of a target text. Here is an example of few shot learning for the task of Named
    Entity Recognition (NER) using 3 examples:'
