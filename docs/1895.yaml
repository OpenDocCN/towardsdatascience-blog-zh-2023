    data stewards, data owners, data engineering and governance committees, each owning
    a fraction of the data value chain. Others concentrate the responsibility across
    only a few specialists who are expected to span across the entire platform. Some
    teams view data quality mainly as a technical challenge while others look at it
    as a business or process problem.

    approach data quality as part of their overall organizational goals. We also surveyed
    200 data professionals to ask, among other things, which of their internal teams
    is responsible for data quality.

    up question. It’s typically posed in a version of, “Why does it matter who owns
    data quality as long as it gets done?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a bit of sophistry in the phrasing since “as long as it gets done”
    is far from certain and frankly the whole purpose of the exercise. There are so
    many studies on the positive impacts of clear [accountability](https://hbr.org/2017/02/how-spotify-balances-employee-autonomy-and-accountability),
    [ownership](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx),
    and [goal setting](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-97846-000) that it is hard
    to cite just one.

    that teams *want* to prioritize ahead of building shiny new products or services,
    but it’s often the one that they *need* to prioritize in order to maintain trust
    or scale their team and platform. And without accountability, the lower visibility
    tasks that advance data quality, such as unit tests or documentation, simply won’t
    get done to the degree they should.

    It doesn’t make sense to have a blazing fast point guard who likes to run in transition

    the most common pattern. It is deployed by about half of all organizations that
    use a modern data stack.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    system thinkers who are well equipped to solve system-wide problems, affecting
    infrastructure, code or data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data engineers work upstream in the systems that have a large impact on data
    quality. If an Airflow job, dbt model, or Fivetran sync fails, they will likely
    be the first to detect the issue and, with features like data lineage, can be
    empowered to understand the downstream blast radius to triage appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are downsides to this approach however. For one, data engineers are often
    in short supply and so focused on systems and pipelines that they don’t always
    have as deep domain knowledge of the data. For example, they may know a dataset
    originates in Salesforce and the dynamics of the pipeline that land the data in
    the data warehouse, but they might not know the *client_currency_exchange_rate
    field* within that dataset can never be negative.

    same person, this can also create silos of tribal knowledge that can be lost when
    people leave and others attempt to onboard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of documentation to ensure knowledge transfer and to embed teams, or pair engineers
    with embedded analysts, to better source domain knowledge.

    engineer. They are well-positioned to navigate both pipeline reliability and field-level
    quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The downside may be limitations in their capacity to solve infrastructure problems
    or coordinate with upstream data-producing teams and systems. Only a fraction
    of data quality problems originate in the transformation layer, so the analytics
    engineers will require strong partnerships with product and platform engineering
    teams, to effectively triage issues in the source systems and ingestion layer
