- en: The focus of the AI industry has shifted towards building more powerful, larger-scale
    language models that can understand and generate human-like text. Models like
    GPT-3 from OpenAI have led the way, demonstrating remarkable capabilities. The
    motto of OpenAI for a long time was to make these models open-sourced. Unfortunately,
    they decided to go in another direction and the new models such as ChatGPT (or
    GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 are now closed-source. The proprietary nature and limited access
    to such models have pushed many researchers and developers to find an open-source
    alternative and contribute to it.

- en: This is where the significance of Falcon-40B lies. In the end of last week,
    the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) announced that Falcon-40B is now free
    of royalties for commercial and research use. Thus, it breaks down the barriers
    of proprietary models, giving developers and researchers free access to a state-of-the-art
    language model that they can use and modify according to their specific needs.

    the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard),
    outperforming models like LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, and MPT. This leaderboard
    aims to track, rank, and evaluate the performance of various LLMs and chatbots,
    providing a clear, unbiased metric of their…
