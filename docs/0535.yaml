- en: The pocket created by an offensive line is a crucial element of the passing
    game, as the quarterback needs a clean pocket to throw the ball accurately and
    on time. A good pocket provides the quarterback ample space and time to move and
    throw, while a poor one collapses quickly, forcing the quarterback to scramble
    or take a sack (unless the quarterback is Patrick Mahomes). While it is easy to
    visualize a good or bad pocket, quantifying its quality, and more generally a
    lineman’s performance, is not straightforward.

- en: This article presents a new metric called “lineman stationarity,” which measures
    the distance that a lineman moves from the ball snap until the next event occurs.
    Lineman stationarity can be calculated on every offensive play and is useful for
    evaluating the performance and fatigue of offensive lineman. By tracking the movement
    and strain experienced by lineman on each play, coaches and analysts can use this
    metric to gain insights into the overall effectiveness of the offensive line during
    a game. All metrics and visualizations were generated using data from the [2023
    NFL Big Data Bowl.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023)

- en: Lineman stationarity is a measure of how far an offensive lineman moves from
    their starting position on the field after the ball has been snapped. It is calculated
    as the difference in yardline position between the moment the ball is snapped
    and the first event that occurs after the…
