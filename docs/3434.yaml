- en: One of the most interesting releases in the recent OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay is the GPTs.
    Essentially, GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can create for specific
    purposes. The process of configuring a workable GPT involves no coding but purely
    through chatting. As a result, since the release, a diverse of GPTs have been
    created by the community to help users be more productive and create more fun
    in life.

    I use ChatGPT (GPT-4) a lot to help me understand complex technical concepts,
    debug issues encountered when implementing the model, and suggest novel research
    ideas or engineering solutions. Despite being quite useful, I often find ChatGPT
    struggles to give me tailored answers beyond its general knowledge of PINN. Although
    I can tweak my prompts to incorporate more contextual information, it is a rather
    time-consuming practice, and can quickly deplete my patience sometimes.
