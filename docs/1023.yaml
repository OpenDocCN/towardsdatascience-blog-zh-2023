- en: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a structured approach to problem-solving that helps
    you identify the underlying cause or causes of a problem, rather than simply addressing
    its symptoms. It allows you to really get to the WHY — why is something happening
    the way it is happening. The output can take multiple forms — but usually can
    be represented as a ‘decision tree’ or ‘failure tree’, something easy to comprehend,
    very visual, that business stakeholders particularly appreciate.

    and evaluating the different causes, identifying the root cause(s), and developing
    a plan of action to address them. Additionally to allowing you to understand the
    “WHY”, it can allow you to have rough estimates of how much you’ll be able to
    move the needle on your problem (and from these estimates you can build prioritization
    models, OKRs, etc.)'

- en: '**#1: Defining the Problem**: The first step in RCA is to clearly define the
    problem you’re trying to solve. In our example (and at this stage), it is pretty
    straightforward: “How might we increase the number of new users who upload a workout
    within 7 days of signing up for our mobile fitness app in order to improve user
    retention rates?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**#2: Gathering the Data**: The next step is to gather data about the problem.
    This involves gathering information about the issue, such as when it occurs /
    what happens / who is impacted / how they are impacted. It is important to get
    both a quant and qual vision of the issue and to talk with people who are either
    impacted and/or are subject matter experts in the topic.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**#3: Identifying & Evaluating Possible Causes**: That’s where the real fun
    begins! Once you have the data, the next step is to identify the possible causes
    of the problem. This involves brainstorming with some subject matter experts and
    talking to your users to be able to have a good understanding of all the factors
    that could be contributing to the issue — the very visible ones, but also the
    underlying causes that may be less obvious.'

    Regression analysis can be useful when you have 0 idea about where to look at.
    It can help you find features highly correlated with your issue, and from there,
    manually deep dive to get a better understanding of the problem.

    building your tree, it is important to evaluate those and understand how much
    they are contributing to your problem. For some of those causes, it will be easy
    as you will have the data, for some others, a bit more complicated, and you might
    have to gather some more data and/or use some imagination to produce some realistic
    estimates — but by having these weights, it will make things easier when you will
    start writing your recommendations and decide which levers to move.

    identified the first nodes of your decision tree, you can re-iterate, all the
    way until you get to the actual causes. As a rule of thumb, you should try to
    iterate this as much as 5 times (the so-called “5 Whys” technique) — this is a
    good forcing function to challenge you to really think about the second/third
    order effect, and not just the obvious causes.'

    incredible impact — if properly done.
