    the world on ethics, risks, and security concerns, and the [Bletchley Park conference](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-chairs-statement-2-november/chairs-summary-of-the-ai-safety-summit-2023-bletchley-park)

    societies but are difficult to tackle. Synthetic data and generative AI in the

    a way to seek out corrupt practices, but also to pre-empt innovations in how corruption

    consistently illustrates the pervasiveness of this issue across governments. Its
    [myriad forms](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/anti-corruption/module-4/key-issues/manifestations-and-consequences-of-public-sector-corruption.html)
    can include patronage, bribes, nepotism, manipulation of evidence, kickbacks,
    and similar behaviours designed to provide advantages through the abuse of function.
    There is a significant financial cost, and the World Bank has projected figure
    at [2.6 trillion USD each year](https://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/what-are-costs-corruption),
    with roughly [one trillion USD paid in bribes annually](https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13493.doc.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%2C,trillion%20in%20bribes%20every%20year)
    worldwide. This is already substantial, but the effect of corruption extends much
    further. Corruption damages trust in public institutions, erodes respect for laws,
    threatens basic services such as education and health, and takes away vital funds
    needed to tackle [climate change](https://www.transparency.org/en/projects/climate-governance-integrity-programme).
    The gains for those involved (or turning a blind eye), and the potential for personal
    security risk acts as a strong deterrent for witnesses coming forward. AI offers
    an important tool to empower anti-corruption units.

    is artificially generated data that is created through algorithms, rather than
    being collected from real-world events or processes. It mimics authentic data,
    making it useful for training machine learning models when actual data is either
    unavailable, insufficient, or sensitive. Models can learn and adapt in environments
    mirroring real-world corruption scenarios, all without risking privacy breaches,
    or compromising sensitive data.

    synthetic data offers a level of granularity that is essential for training AI
    to detect nuanced patterns of corruption that do not show up in simpler datasets.

    two neural networks — the Generator and the Discriminator — in a dynamic process
    where each network learns by trying to outwit the other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having been trained on limited real data, the Generator creates synthetic detailed
    corruption scenarios, while the Discriminator tries to determine whether what
    it is examining is real or fake (again initially drawing on its own limited real
    data training). The initial creations are likely to be crude, with the Discriminator
    easily identifying the right answer. However, the Generator learns from this,
    and improves its productions. As the Generator’s data becomes increasingly realistic,
    the Discriminator’s ability to differentiate also sharpens. This iterative process
    continues until the final synthetic data is a close replica of actual and potential
    real-world scenarios, and nuanced patterns of corruption.

    that are both reactive (spotting corrupt incidents), and proactive (identifying
    developing real-life scenarios that have increasing likelihoods of leading to
    corruption). AI systems trained on the synthetic data can learn from a wide variety
    of potential corruption scenarios, including those that might not be well-represented
    or available in real-world data. This means that the AI system increases its understanding
    of corruption patterns and develops more robust and intelligent systems to fight

    is a methodical approach to combating corruption that goes beyond detecting current
    practices to predicting and adapting to emerging trends. Using a continuous, iterative
    learning process, the system can potentially identify and adapt to future methods
    for corruption. The scarcity of data on corruption — in particular the level of
    detail that allows detection systems to pick up on increasingly subtle indicators,
    potentially spread over multiple jurisdictions — is mitigated by the ability of
    GANs to develop new data for a wealth of different scenarios.

    The pace of innovation in corrupt practices is accelerating, with AI deployed
    to create increasingly opaque and convoluted networks designed to circumvent classic
    tools of detection. Government anti-corruption agencies need to maintain — as
    a minimum — a similar trajectory of invention and investing in GAN-generated synthetic
    data provides an opportunity to predict and therefore mitigate. Moreover, with
    trillions lost per year to corruption, developing AI in an area where success
    can lead to a direct increase in budgets for public spending, pursuing such an
    investment enables governments to deliver on providing for their people.
