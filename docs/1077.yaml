- en: In coffee, taste is king, but quantifiable data for extraction efficiency using
    Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) has been a useful tool to help evaluate hardware
    and techniques. TDS is measured using a refractometer where there is a preference
    for a digital refractometer.

    DiFluid has come out with two refractometers for much less than the standard VST
    or Atago. Currently, the data suggests the [DiFluid R2](https://medium.com/@rmckeon/difluid-r2-coffee-refractometer-device-variation-20cf1a663d99)
    is as capable as the VST or Atago. I think this refractometer presents an interesting
    question to how accessible coffee data is becoming: what’s more important, quality
    or quantity with respect to data collection routines?'

    great metric to understand coffee strength and calculate extraction efficiency.
    It has become a vital tool for me in my explorations.

    to 24% EY), and refractometers may have other challenges for lower strength brews
    like filter coffee. However, I do not address those topics.

- en: I’ve been doing data stuff for a long time (over a decade). One of the issues
    that typically comes up in a user study is quality of data vs quantity. To get
    better quality data, a person has to comply better with the protocol, but compliance
    costs time. However, once a machine learning algorithm is applied, a certain amount
    of noise is added to the data anyways. It turns out that more data even if it
    is less quality, can be more desirable for some experiments because we don’t have
    all day to do all the stuff.
  prefs: []

- en: So even if there is a noise in the signal, collecting more samples at a faster
    rate could allow for the noise to be averaged out. I like applying this to coffee
    as well because I have other things I want to do in life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not everyone has the lab, money, and time to control all variables. So control
    as much as you can. Even if you have noise, as long as that noise is consistent,
    then it is more controlled than random. The worse is systematic bias in the noise.

    We know there is a connection between refractive index and TDS, but there is still
    some gray area. Sugar water has a very clear refractive index, but looking through
    a optical refractometer, coffee does not have as distinct of a line.
