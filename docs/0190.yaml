- en: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm of AI methodologies in which an agent
    learns to interact with its environment in order to maximize the expectation of
    reward signals received from its environment. Unlike supervised learning, in which
    the agent is given labeled examples and learns to predict an output based on input,
    RL involves the agent actively taking actions in its environment and receiving
    feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. This feedback is used to adjust
    the agent’s behavior and improve its performance over time.

    language processing, and finance. In the gaming industry, RL has been used to
    develop advanced game-playing agents, such as the **AlphaGo [1]** algorithm that
    defeated a human champion in the board game Go. In the healthcare industry, RL
    has been used to optimize treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases,
    such as diabetes. RL has also been used in the field of robotics, allowing robots
    to learn and adapt to new environments and tasks.
