    good for you. But believe me, the time will come for you, sooner or (hopefully
    ) later. And when it comes, your skills will cease being important, as you won’t
    be using them anymore; they will be as useless as a bag of gold on a deserted
    island.

    that works for me.

- en: Developer’s block (or programmer’s block) is a phenomenon that occurs when a
    programmer experiences difficulty coming up with new ideas or solutions to problems.
    In the crudest version, writing the next line of code is close to impossible.
  prefs: []

- en: It is similar to writer’s block, where a writer struggles to generate new ideas
    or content. Conditions this may be caused by a variety of factors, such as tiredness,
    lack of sleep or motivation, difficulty understanding a problem — or last but
    not least, burnout.

- en: In fact, it’s more often than not that burnout leads to such a block. You sit
    in front of your computer and try to do something, but the only thing you can
    think of is that you *will not do it*. For whatever reason, it doesn’t matter
    what it is — you simply *cannot do*…
