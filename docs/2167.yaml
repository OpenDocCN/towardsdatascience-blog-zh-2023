    with on social media these days is stories of how people taught themselves data
    science in three months and were hired by a FAANG company quicker than you could
    say “database”.

    data science and get started with a new career. It can also seem like a pointless
    exercise when you’ve tried everything in the past to teach yourself the concepts
    and tools you’ll need to succeed, only for you to give up in a couple of weeks
    due to a lack of commitment, advancement, or enjoyment.

    the past four years straight, is that success comes when you finally learn how
    to work with your brain — instead of against it. And that comes with learning
    how to work with the seasonality of your brain.

    [Annual rhythms of brain activity were studied in 2016](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1518129113)
    and were found to fluctuate depending on the season. The study found that the
    brain performed at maximum capacity in sustained attention tasks during the summer,
    but at minimum capacity in the same tasks during the winter. Additionally, the
    brain performed at maximum capacity in working memory (working memory refers to
    the memory needed for [“planning, comprehension, reasoning, and problem solving”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#:~:text=Abstract,reasoning%2C%20and%20problem%2Dsolving.))
    tasks during the autumn, but at minimum capacity in the same tasks during the
    spring. While more studies are needed to solidify these findings, we can still
    use them to produce a one-year data science study plan that will use your brain
    to its maximum potential.

    exactly kicking when it comes to sustained attention tasks. However, that doesn’t
    mean that you can’t begin working your way through programming tutorials and becoming
    familiar with databases and data structures.
  prefs: []

- en: From experience, I can say that you shouldn’t be spending more than three hard
    hours a day learning to code or work with databases. There’s just something about
    learning to code that lends itself best to giving your all in two to three hours
    of lectures and then spending the rest of your time working on practice problems
    — which is typically where you do most of your learning anyways.

    projects or completing Leetcode practice questions. The application process of
    coding is where you will learn the most. Writing code, running into errors, learning
    to navigate StackOverflow, and making corrections is what will solidify the concepts
    you learned earlier in the day.

    data visualization concepts and trying to commit them as best you can to memory.
  prefs: []

    and for good reason — you’re learning about accurate data representations, visualization
    types, and aesthetics. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that this stuff
    isn’t important. Quit the opposite. Data visualization is where you tell the data’s
    story, as well as give your predictions for the future.

    These three areas of math are the ones that you’ll need for most general data
    science jobs (industry-specific requirements may require higher levels of mathematics,
    such as multivariable calculus, differential equations, and discrete math).

    months learning the fundamentals behind data analysis — that’s not a lot of time.
    Instead, the goal is for you to methodically think through the steps involved
    in data analysis while applying what you have been able to learn in the previous
    year. You may not have all the answers, and there may still be some techniques
    that elude you from being able to produce the best analysis possible. However,
    you should have the basic skills necessary to draw some insightful conclusions
    from the data you’re working with.
