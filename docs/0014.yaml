    the need for specialist roles and a strong emphasis on the last mile. This way
    data analysts are more focused on analysis, insights, and decision-making.

- en: If you look at most job descriptions, they will highlight that the mission of
    data analysts is to deliver insights. This is very ambiguous in itself — is the
    role to be a self-service enabler (i.e., answer to business requests and build
    dashboards) or to deliver recommendations? Organizations have different visions
    for the role of a data analyst, varying from self-service enabler (i.e., answer
    to business requests and build out dashboards) to trusted business advisor powered

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think about the “Data Wrangler” as a data analyst stuck in the initial
    generalist definition of the data analyst role. S/he is responsible for doing
    anything and everything data related ranging from pulling data from different
    resources, and reports, cleaning the data, and preparing dashboards. Therefore
    they barely have time to focus on surfacing insights and the value they deliver
    is diluted.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the “Dashboard builder” state is a bit more evolved than the “data wrangler”,
    these analysts are not focused on actionable insights. They spend most of their
    days on visualization, building, and managing dashboards. They look for insights
    reactively to answer the questions of the business teams or to put out fires.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Outcome:* The value of the analyst remains uncovered. There is a significant
    bias in the decision-making process preventing the discovery of real insights,
    and the analyst teams are overwhelmed with ad hoc requests.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data culture of the company is already strong. Analysts’ focus is on delivering
    insights but they are unable to uncover them at the pace of business. They often
    have a lot of non-analyst work to deal with. There is a need to augment analytics
    workflows to free them up and enable them to focus mostly on the last mile of
    analytics.
