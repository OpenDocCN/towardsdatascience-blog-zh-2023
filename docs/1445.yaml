    future, and a big piece of that puzzle are the vehicles its citizens use to go
    about their daily lives. In conjunction with the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://electrek.co/2023/04/17/which-electric-vehicles-still-qualify-for-us-federal-tax-credit/)
    (which provides tax credits up to $7,500 for new EV purchases and up to $4,000
    for used EVs — conditional on locations of vehicle assembly and battery material
    sourcing), California has implemented the [Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulations](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii),
    which require automaker sales to be at least 35% EVs by 2026\. After 2026, the
    requirement scales up linearly each year until 2035, when all sales must be EVs.

    the Pandas DataFrame object and includes a geometry column.

    active will be used for joins, plotting, or other applications. You can use the
    GeoDataFrame.set_geometry() method to set the geometry to a different column.
    Also, when two GeoDataFrames are joined, one of the active geometry columns will

    then it appears we will not hit the goal of 35% EV adoption rate by 2026\. However,
    the DMV data reflects vehicle counts at the beginning of each year, and therefore
    isn’t counting the period of time after the new incentive structure was rolled
    out (August of 2022). The blue circle in the graph above compensates for that.
    It demonstrates the state-wide EV adoption rate for the year of 2022, and was
    taken from [energy.ca.gov](https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/zero-emission-vehicle-and-infrastructure-statistics/new-zev-sales).

    perhaps there is a sentiment amongst residents that EVs will be a functional downgrade
    from what they are used to in these conditions). It is also possible that there
    is little charging infrastructure in this part of the state. The big outlier here
    is Imperial County, the southeastern most county of California. It is a more populous
    county than the others in this list and is a desert (as opposed to redwood filled
    mountains). It may also be facing an infrastructure shortage. Although out of
    scope for this analysis, we could determine if lack of infrastructure correlates

    the public on 4/17/23\. Assuming no changes to this list for the foreseeable future,
    the tax credits will primarily benefit Chevrolet, Ford, Tesla, Jeep, and Lincoln
    and hurt Nissan, Volvo, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, Toyota, and Volkswagen (although
    I’ve seen conflicting information of whether the Volkswagen ID.4 will qualify).
    This is expected, as the IRA is supposed to stimulate car manufacturing (and consequently
    automaker jobs) within the US and its allies, and is supposed to decrease reliance
    on Foreign Entities of Concern (FEC) such as China.'

    it’s not clear if any EV sellers have clear regions where they are strong.

- en: Though this doesn’t have to do directly with EVs, I also looked at California’s
    Vehicles per Capita on a county level and examined how that number is trending
    from 2018 to 2022\. As we seek to transition to a more sustainable society, we
    must not only move towards EVs but also use less personal vehicles in general,
    depending on public transportation, biking, and carpooling where we can. This
    portion of the analysis studies how many vehicles there are per person in California,
    and whether that number is trending upwards or downwards regionally.

    with the highest vehicles per capita, and San Francisco county (though it may
    be hard to see) and the bay area are the lowest. Generally we see through the
    central valley a low number of vehicles per capita, but this could be more likely
    because of lower wealth rather than the bay area, where it likely has to do with
    higher access to transportation. The lack of vehicles per capita in the central
    valley could also have to do with a lack of vehicles being registered.

- en: The second graph demonstrates how much vehicles per capita has shifted per county
    in the last 5 years. In most counties it has either stayed relatively flat or
    increased. In the bay area it has dropped significantly. One hypothesis I have
    for this is the advent of work from home. My hypothesis is that since many people
    in the tech industry (which is particularly concentrated around the bay area)
    started working from home as a result of the pandemic, they were not commuting
    and had less need for their cars, therefore selling them (though out of scope
    for this analysis, used car sales data could be used to explore this further).

- en: The EV landscape in California is sprawling and nuanced, and we have just scratched
    the surface here. Overall, it seems like Californians are trending in the correct
    direction when it comes to 35% of EV adoption rate by 2026, while individual automakers
    have a lot to do to hit this goal themselves. It will be interesting to see how
    the next few years play out!
