- en: Cocomelon — Nursery Rhymes is the world's second-largest Youtube channel (155M+
    subscribers). It is such a popular and helpful channel that it is an inevitable
    subject for toddlers and parents. I enjoy spending time watching Cocomelon together
    with my son.

- en: After watching Cocomelon videos for a month, I noticed the same videos are repeatedly
    recommended on Youtube. Videos like "The wheel on the bus" and "bath song" are
    popular and fun to watch, but they were published years ago, and kids got bored
    watching them repeatedly. As a father, I want to show some more recent but good-quality
    videos from the Cocomelon channel. As a data professional, I also want to explore
    the world's second-largest Youtube channel data to gain more insights and find
    something interesting about the data available.

- en: 'All videos within a YouTube channel only provide users with two options: recently
    uploaded (order by time) and popular (order by view). I could go to the recently
    uploaded tab and click one after another. However, the Cocomelon channel has 800+
    videos, which will be time-consuming.'
