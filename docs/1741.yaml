    journey of data governance?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While many different facets of data management could act as the starting point,
    this article puts forth an argument for Master Data Management (MDM) to be the
    foundation upon which an organization can build its initial data governance maturity.
    An MDM implementation can enable you to bring together a core set of data governance
    disciplines, apply them to a limited yet impactful scope, learn lessons and set
    standards, and then scale them out across the rest of the organization afterwards.

    data on key business entities across an organization’s systems, applications,
    and processes. MDM is crucial in providing a single, reliable source of truth
    for master data attributes such as customer, product, vendor, or raw materials
    data. (For a more detailed definition, see [here](https://medium.com/@willemkoenders/my-mdm-framework-4d2233f7e3f).)

    (as delegated by data owners) to look after the data. This includes responsibilities
    to ensure fitness-for-purpose of the data, and can enable the creation of a wider
    data governance RACI-matrix that can be expanded to non-MDM areas later on. Hence,

    across the organization’s transactions. This should not be optional — if there
    is mastered data, then its consumption should be mandatory for anyone consuming
    this data. This helps to establish a wider reference data architecture, where

    guaranteed. For example, for country fields, only options are allowed that appear

    a case study involving a leading insurance company that I had the opportunity
    to work with. This company, one of the top three in terms of market share in its
    primary market, embarked on a project to implement an MDM solution for its customer
    data.
  prefs: []

    which was being handled by another vendor, was not only implemented but truly
    operationalized within the enterprise. This involved establishing the right processes,
    documenting these processes, creating a robust data model, developing a data quality
    solution and dashboard, as well as a metadata model and basic metadata management
    process. We also identified and established crucial roles such as a data owner,
    data stewards, and data quality analyst.

    data in this case was the company’s marketing department, with use cases including
    customer segmentation and marketing campaign management. Prior to the MDM implementation,
    the company struggled to achieve even a basic 360-degree view of its customers
    due to difficulties in reconciling customer data from various sources.

    a consolidated and reliable view of customer data, the marketing team was able
    to discern whether a customer engaged with one business line also had products
    from another. This facilitated a deeper, data-driven approach to customer segmentation,
    replacing the previous rule-based analysis. The newly accessible data enabled
    predictive modeling for determining the “next best action” and allowed marketing
    campaigns to be activated on a much more personal level.

    data, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. With updates

    emails) integrated into the MDM solution, all consumers of this information had
    access to the most current details. As a result, the success rate of reaching
    the intended recipient with written marketing materials or via phone increased
    by >20%. According to the team’s estimates, the return on their investment in
    marketing campaigns increased by as much as 50%.
