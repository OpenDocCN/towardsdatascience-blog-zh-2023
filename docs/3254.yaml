    ‘true science’ (whatever that may mean). Rather, I hope to provide some different
    views of what it means to be a data scientist, which I hope will help in thinking
    how to take different perspectives when analyzing a problem. Originally, I was
    planning to call this essay “What I learned as a data scientist from Plato and
    the Nerd” [1]. Plato and the Nerd is a book written by Edward Ashford Lee that
    I recently came across. The title of the book does not really convey what the
    book is about. In a way, this does justice to Lee’s writing. He takes many interesting
    side paths — what he calls “nerd storms” — that the main message of his book remains
    opaque. In this essay, I’ll focus on one aspect of his book: the difference between
    science and engineering and how this collides with common thought in Data Science.
    Although Lee wrote the book for a general audience, I found the book especially
    useful to reflect on my own studies in computer science/information technology.'

    between engineering and science. In particular, through the lens of Lee’s arguments,
    the common thought that *“[Data science is a] concept to unify statistics, data
    analysis, informatics, and their related methods [in order to]* ***understand
    and analyze actual phenomena*** *[with data].” (emphasis mine)* [2], which at
    the moment of writing is the first quote on the Data Science page of Wikipedia,
    seems to be a misconception. In the remainder of this essay, I will try to explain
    why, under Lee’s arguments, this is the case. I will do so by first taking a closer
    look at what we most often mean by this “actual phenomena”. Second, I’ll reflect
    on Lee’s distinction between engineering and science, which, given that we talk
    about data *science,* seems relevant. Last, I’ll philosophize on what this may
    mean to the work of data scientists.

    a history comedy podcast. An episode that I like in particular is one about the
    history of time keeping. In the episode, they talk about the many aspects of time
    that we currently take for granted. Even though I constantly use concepts of time,
    this episode made me realize just how little I knew (and know) about how these
    concepts came into existence. I just accept that an hour contains 60 minutes,
    that there’s a difference between work and leisure time, or that time exists in
    a continuum. All of these concepts about time are the visions of people that still
    echo through our culture without us realizing it. No wonder Lee refers to them
    as “unknown knowns”. Unknown knows also go under a different name: mental models.'
  prefs: []

- en: An important task of science is to become aware of these unknown knowns, and
    test them against reality. The history of science is full of such examples. Before
    Copernicus, the common mental model was that the sun circulated around the earth.
    For a long time in our history, bloodletting, or the use of mercury, were considered
    medically sound. Statistics itself is also full of unknown knowns. Combining observations
    to improve accuracy, like the use of the mean instead of picking the most `reliable’
    single observation, was rare and often criticized before 1750\. When Euler tried
    to predict the motions of Jupiter and Saturn, he used the data points he considered
    most likely, instead of using an average over all the data to predict [4, p.p.
    25–31]. In another example, 19th century economists had to defend themselves against
    legal charges when combining the prices of several products into one index [4,
    Ch. 1], even though at that time, statistical methods were widely used among astronomers.

- en: For a data scientist, testing mental models against reality seems to be at the
    core of one’s activities. This is not only true for trivial examples, like A/B
    testing, but also in forecasting and optimization. People have a strong tendency
    to connect pieces of information to make a coherent story, even if these pieces
    of information are actually disconnected (the so-called hindsight bias). Once
    such a story is in someone’s head, it can be difficult to change it. In fact,
    the confirmation bias would suggest that the person will mostly look for evidence
    supporting the story. Even if you can show that a forecasting model is more accurate,
    or that a planning algorithm performs superiorly compared to what a human can
    do, you will always find people arguing that the model does not work in this or
    that exception. Or that, as the model may be a black box, it cannot be trusted.
    I personally experienced this with the recent developments around ChatGPT. It’s
    difficult to accept that this software may write this blog, given only a few words
    of instructions, perhaps better than I would. This only makes me think of reasons
    why ChatGPT must be inaccurate, unsafe, or unreliable. The idea that a model you
    create will be perceived with an open mind is an illusion. You always have to
    compete with already existing models, whether mentally or physically.

    to fool yourself that you are able to do something. Take the imposter syndrome,
    that feeling that people have that the success they achieved is just luck, and
    that they can be exposed as frauds any minute. You need to “fake it ‘till you

    advocates a method of quick entrepreneurial trial and error for rapid growth.
    Hopefully, this will lead to the company being large enough to going public. Subsequently,
    the idea that businesses need to quickly ‘scale up’, is likely to be inspired

    East-India Company (VOC) [9], coming from a country that at that time itself had
    only recently been invented, after having been forged by four generations of Burgundian
    rulers . Perhaps most interesting is the concept of money itself, about which

    of off/on switches. The target (the transistor) is faithful to the model (an off/on
    switch). Following the above definitions of an engineer and scientist, the creation
    of the transistor is an engineering job. What is more, Lee shows that also electromagnetic
    laws such as Faraday’s law, which would describe the “real behavior” of transistors,
    are in fact models. Only in certain situations does reality obey these models;
    in others, they can be plainly wrong. In fact, science seems to be a stack of

    To me, the concept of Data Science was precisely the ‘discovery’ part. One should
    grind through data as an independent observer, coming up with ‘insights’ that
    help the organization add ‘value’. Following that concept, the data scientist
    is like Agatha Christie’s Poirot, the inspector who seeks out evidence to solve
    the mystery, but who isn’t part of how the murder is plotted. And, of course,
    once the mystery is solved, it is revealed to the audience (for the data scientist,
    in a somewhat less spectacular Power Point presentation), who awe at the brilliance
    of the solution. True, this is a bit exaggerated, but the idea that the solution
    should be complex and be discovered by white men with glasses is certainly part
    of another mental model [12]. Following Lee’s definition of a scientist, our Data
    Science Poirot indeed does describe someone who invents a model faithful to reality,

    benefit can be found, then there is often something else that benefits from the

    that much. Changing human behavior can be difficult. But, not realizing that,

    model is, for example, one with little randomness. Whether that be in manufacturing
    and logistics under the name ‘six sigma’, or in customer service’s ‘effortless
    experience’ [16]. If the model is capable of coping with randomness, it’s easier
    to analyze and make decisions based on it. It is here that the probabilistic background
    of the data scientist comes of value. One can reduce the randomness by explaining
    some of the randomness using a statistical model, use techniques like simulation
    to determine how well a model copes with uncertainty, or point out that perhaps
    business owners are focusing too much on volatile day-to-day performance and not
    seeing the more stable long-term patterns. As Lee’s example of the transistor
    and subsequent layers of abstraction shows, decreasing randomness is incredibly
    important in order to build subsequent layers of abstraction. When I’m programming
    in Python, I don’t have to think about how exactly the program is executed on
    my machine, and I take it for granted that the program is perhaps not as fast
    as it could have been, had it been programmed in a language closer to machine

    more randomness. Small disruptions may be smoothed by using buffers, but this
    is not the case for large disruptions, which have been frequent since the Corona
    crisis [17]. As a consequence, research has increasingly looked for ways to prepare
    for disruptions, rather than try to reduce them [18]. Also here, the data scientist
    has an engineering role. Will he/she explain the observed variance as something
    to be reduced, or should it be accepted as something unavoidable? Explaining one

    slot machines are still as addictive as ever, the media attention on algorithms
    gone wrong has increased attention on things like algorithm fairness [20]. Important
    public algorithms (such as search engines) are more often under scrutiny by algorithm
    audits [21]. Under the motto “you can’t manage what you can’t measure”, if you
    include measures of fairness into your analysis, the decision maker will have
    to explain why he/she might have ignored that measure. If no measure of fairness
    is reported, the decision maker may not realize that there is a fairness issue

    analytics (which just analyze phenomena) stages have been completed. However,
    in many applications, one may find that behavior (the actual phenomenon) has been
    adjusted to a model (revenue, fairness, etc.), not vice versa. Although some systems
    and technologies are more user-friendly than others, one cannot help but recognize
    that, for a considerable part, people have adjusted to technology. Yes, I find
    Google a user-friendly search engine, but I’ve also become trained in searching
