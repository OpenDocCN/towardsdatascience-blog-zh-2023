- en: Box plot or [Box and Whisker plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) is
    a common data visualization in [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics).
    This chart graphically demonstrates numerical data through their [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile),
    which consist of the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
    Moreover, it helps spot outliers easily.

    explaining what it is, let’s look at the pictures below.

    with histograms, as shown below. In this case, using Box plots can mislead the

    to the [local maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) of a distribution.
    When coping with a [bimodal distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-a-bimodal-distribution/),
    which has two modes (or peaks), or [multimodal distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/multimodal-distribution/),
    which has multiple peaks, Box plots can not express this insight information.
  prefs: []

- en: Moreover, the shape of a Box plot is rectangular, so it can trick us into thinking
    that there are data inside the interquartile range area. If there are gaps or
    no data in the interquartile range, they can not be noticed.

    plot. Thus, the result can express the peaks of a dataset. This is a good idea

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This article has shown that the Box plot has limitations in demonstrating the
    mode(s), which can cause a misleading interpretation. It is not helpful in plotting
    a dataset with two or more peaks or showing data gaps inside the interquartile
    range. By the way, the Box plot has some advantages, such as being a simple visualization
    and showing outliers.

    the drawbacks of the Box plot.
