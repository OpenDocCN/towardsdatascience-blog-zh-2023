- en: Although most of us don’t see it, optimization algorithms (OAs) are at work
    everywhere. They plan shelve stocking for our grocery stores, create airport schedules,
    and give us the shortest route to our holiday destination. **Exact algorithms
    in particular do very well at exploiting known structures** — e.g., convex structures
    — finding solutions even in massive decision spaces with many constraints. Over
    the past decades, the combination of hardware- and algorithmic improvements yielded
    massive speed-ups in the order of millions. A planning task that might have taken
    a computer months to complete in the 90’s could just take a second today.

- en: Similarly, machine learning (ML) has taken an incredible flight in the last
    decade or so. MuZero showed the capability to learn superhuman game-playing policies
    without knowing the games’ rules, Graph Neural Networks learn complex relations
    unperceivable to the human eye, and Transformers gave rise to ChatGPT and its
    competitors. **The commonality is that these algorithms are all able to detect
    patterns from their environment**, be it text databases or video games. Novel
    and highly complicated architectures are introduced on a regular basis, often…
