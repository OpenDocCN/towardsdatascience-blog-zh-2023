- en: I have observed two extreme approaches when it comes to aspiring data scientists
    attempting to learn machine learning algorithms. The first approach involves learning
    **all the intricacies** of the algorithms and implementing them from scratch to
    gain true mastery. The second approach, on the other hand, assumes that the computer
    will “learn” on its own, rendering the need for the individual to learn the algorithms
    unnecessary. This leads some to **only** rely on tools such as the package lazypredict.

    learning algorithms. However, the question remains, where to start? In this article,
    I will categorize machine learning algorithms into three categories and provide
    my humble opinion on what to begin with and what can be skipped.

    available algorithms. Linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), gradient
    descent, gradient boosting, decision trees, LASSO, ridge, grid search, and many
    more are some of the algorithms that come to mind when posed with the question.
