    I explain how grid-based pathfinding can be improved to yield highly direct walking
    paths without using line-of-sight tests. This follow-up article will show you
    a related technique called **grid-based visibility**, which computes visible regions
    without line-of-sight tests. Grid-based visibility is virtually unheard of in
    the computer science community, but it’s a practical method that makes sense for
    a variety of artificial intelligence applications. It’s also extremely easy to
    implement, requiring as few as 3 lines of code. Read on to discover your simplest
    option for solving visibility problems in video games, mobile robotics, or architectural
    design.

    A mobile robotics engineer may need to compute a robot’s field of view in a simulation

- en: The history of grid-based visibility explains why the method never gained widespread
    recognition. First of all, despite its simplicity, grid-based visibility wasn’t
    invented until 2004 [2], and its convergence properties weren’t established until
    2008 [3]. By that time, vector-based approaches like ray casting had become ubiquitous.
    Computer scientists were no longer searching for competing approaches. Secondly,
    the first papers on grid-based visibility came from a branch of mathematics called
    level set theory, where geometry is represented in an implicit manner unfamiliar
    to most computer scientists. While the level set visibility method works in 2D
    or 3D and uses linear interpolation, a strictly 3D alternative using bi-linear
    interpolation was developed by architectural and urban informatics researchers
    in 2013 [4].

    is in the top left corner. We begin by placing a 1 in that corner, then we repeatedly
    copy numbers downward and to the right. When two numbers converge on the same
    grid cell, we add them together. The result is that every grid cell contains the
    number of grid paths heading away from the viewpoint and ending up at that cell.
    For example, there are 742 such paths from the viewpoint to the bottom right corner.

    by counting, we take the two sets of path counts and divide. Taking the actual
    number of paths to each grid cell (the first animation above), and then dividing
    by the maximum possible number of paths to that cell (the second animation), we
    end up with the visibility score for each grid cell. We then classify each cell
    as visible if its score is at least 0.5\. For example, the cell in the bottom
    right corner is reached by 742 out of a possible 2002 grid paths. Its visibility
    score is 472/2002, or approximately 0.37, and it is classified as not visible.

    are mathematically equivalent to those produced by the original interpolation
    formula. In other words, both methods are viable ways of solving the visible region
    problem. If we choose to implement visibility by counting, however, we must remember
    that path counts increase exponentially with distance. If we represent these counts
    using 64-bit floating-point numbers, the path counts will overflow after reaching
    1030 grid moves from the viewpoint. For that reason, I believe it makes sense
    to default to the linear interpolation method when implementing grid-based visibility.
    At the same time, I feel that the connection to path counting is interesting and
    deserves to be shared.

    results without increasing the resolution of the grid. Our examples so far have
    used only the 4-neighborhood, which is the simplest but least accurate 2D grid
    neighborhood. As previously mentioned, we have the option of choosing a larger
    grid neighborhood for more accurate results. The diagram below depicts the 4-,
    8-, and 16-neighborhoods for rectangular grids, as well as the 6- and 12-neighborhoods
    for triangular grids.

    the top of the article. In this new version of the program, the `visibility_within_cone`
    function computes visibility scores within a cone bracketed by two vectors. This
    may not be the most efficient implementation, but it will help us understand that
    transitioning to larger grid neighborhoods means applying the same algorithm within
    a greater number of thinner cones.

    still using the 4-neighborhood. The results are the same as those produced by
    our first script.

    replace the code in the `Compute visibility` section with the code below. The
    visibility function is now applied twice, first within the cone between the diagonal
    `[1,1]` and the grid axis `[1,0]`, and then between `[1,1]` and `[0,1]`.

    most applications. However, it is possible to continue upgrading to the 32-neighborhood,
    the 64-neighborhood, etc., if higher quality results are needed.

    grids, are trickier to implement because there’s no ideal way to index the grid
    cells. Various indexing strategies are described in the [Red Blog Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/)
    tutorial on [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), which
    includes a section on visibility using line-of-sight tests. I leave it as a challenge
    to you to implement grid-based visibility on a triangular grid.

    other vector-based visibility methods. Due to the timing and context of its discovery,
    the approach remains largely unknown to computer scientists. But I hope you’ll
    agree that it’s time for grid-based visibility to become visible, and I hope you’ll
    find an opportunity to use it in one of your own artificial intelligence projects.
