    Does it seem to you that analytics are being used efficiently or effectively?
    Or can you see ways in which precious time and resources are being wasted? In
    an economy where [**managers lose more than a half-million days per year on ineffective
    decision making**](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/three-keys-to-faster-better-decisions),
    the opportunity to reduce waste is huge at all levels.

    business partner or skated to where the puck used to be. Maybe the problem is
    that you rely too much on consensus, your roles are unclear, your data is obsolete,
    or — the one I’ll describe below — your culture lacks empowerment. In any case,
    one big reason why an organization’s decision-making process is ineffective is
    that they haven’t automated their analytics at scale. The waste in the system
    leads to slow, ineffective decision making.

    a business event like a change in the competitive landscape to a business action
    like a marketing campaign. But how often does that happen quickly in your organization?
    Aren’t there almost always bottlenecks and points of latency and friction that
    slow the transition from one step to the next?

    you remove the analytics waste from your decision-making process, you can become
    much more competitive.

    analytics may be in advanced, predictive tools that highlight evolving trends,
    or they may be in traditional tools like spreadsheets.
  prefs: []

    and the information is delivered, but then what? It will probably be stored someplace

    decision will be long past.

    latency — whether around data, analytics, decision, or action — is an obstacle
    to your competitiveness. Those points of latency add up to the delay you face
    in getting from business event to business action. They represent the analytics
    waste in your organization. So, what can you do about them?

    is to examine each type of latency and figure out what’s causing the analytics
    waste.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data latency occurs when people who need access to the data cannot get that
    access. Data access and sharing should be the norm, not the exception. Eliminate
    analytics waste by moving away from batch orientation and towards a more real-time
    architecture. For example, the retailer that monitors inventory levels across
    stores only once a day risks running out of stock and losing money in a sudden
    storm or holiday rush.

- en: Analytics latency can arise even after you’ve solved for data latency. Are you
    getting bogged down because you have to rely on specialists to analyze your data
    and get back to you? Data scientists and specialists are prized for working on
    a few high-value projects every year, so it will likely be a while before they
    can work on your task. Here, the answer lies in empowering everyone in the organization,
    regardless of skill level, to participate in the data and analytics process. While
    your data scientists are focused on a few big-ticket problems, the people in the
    business operate where the data is generated and can focus on lots of little problems.
    But they need data literacy, upskilling and easy-to-use software.

    inscrutable dashboards and reports. Even if people are empowered to make decisions,
    can they look at the information displayed right in front of them and know that
    a decision needs to be made? There are three parts to addressing this:'

    made. Are you capable of responding quickly enough to take advantage of favorable
    conditions? You can aspire to rely more on predictive analytics, for example,
    but what’s the point if your organizational processes are old, brittle, and labor-intensive?
    The solution is to introduce more analytic automation to processes. That means
    that if analytics show your Toronto store will run out of beige widgets tomorrow,
    all business processes are in place to ship inventory before then. The more you
    can automate those processes, the sooner you can turn your attention to higher-value
    tasks.
