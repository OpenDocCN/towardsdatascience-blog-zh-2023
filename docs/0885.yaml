    little helpful information on the topic online. Here, I’ll describe the basics
    of IV contrast, how it appears in CT images, and how it might affect your imaging
    dataset.

- en: As a data scientist working on medical imaging studies, it is important to understand
    how contrast is being used in your datasets because contrast strongly affects
    the appearance of the CT exam, both intensity and texture. Depending on the application,
    contrast may be the main source of your imaging features, or it may be an unwanted
    source of variation. You will also find that the use of contrast can be subtle,
    and sometimes poorly labeled, so having a good working knowledge of this topic
    will help you organize your dataset and plan your study much more effectively.

    a bit about X-Ray physics. A CT scanner is a 3D imaging system that measures the
    X-Ray energy which is absorbed by organs and tissues in the body. Inside the scanner,
    a rotating X-Ray tube emits high-energy photons through the body and into a detector
    array, which measures the decay rate, or *attenuation,* of the photon energy.

    of photons, increasing the rate of attenuation. These high-attenuating regions
    will appear very bright in the resulting scan.

    dark. Attenuation is reported in *Hounsfield Units (HU) (*named after the inventor
    of CT, Godfrey Hounsfield) and are normalized such that air has an attenuation
    of -1000HU and water has an attenuation of 0HU. Fat tissue has a typical attenuation
    of -100 to -50HU, blood has an attenuation of +30HU, and soft tissue has an attenuation
    of +10 to +50HU.

    to distinguish from their surroundings. In the absence of contrast, most of the
    soft tissue in the body has a very similar X-Ray absorption, and will appear a
    uniform gray.

    (swallowed), although contrast has been adapted for [every conceivable method
    of administration](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/routes-of-administration-and-retrieval?lang=us).
    Ingested contrast is used to highlight the stomach, small, and large bowel in
    gastrointestinal imaging. Intravenous (IV) contrast, which is much more common,
    is used for a variety of indications (it can also be coupled with ingested contrast).

    or barium which is suspended in a liquid solution. The heavy metal has a very
    high attenuation which preferentially blocks X-Ray energy and appears bright in
    the resulting CT image.

    level, tissues that have more blood will appear brighter, or more *enhanced*.
    In the abdomen CT exam below, the left CT was acquired before contrast was injected,
    and the right CT was acquired after. Adipose (fat) tissue, which is poorly perfused,
    has a similar appearance in both images, however the liver and spleen, which both
    receive a high perfusion, appear brighter (more *enhanced*) in the right-most
    image. Notice the biggest difference is in the aorta, and the vessels of the liver
    and spleen.

    into a vein in the arm (to ensure the timing of the bolus remains consistent,
    the contrast is pushed into the with a pump, [sometimes at up to 300psi](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/saline-flush-during-contrast-medium-administration?lang=us)).
    That *bolus* of contrast will take a few seconds to travel up to the heart and
    lungs. From the heart, it will pass through the aorta, branching into the major
    arteries, then into the tissues of the body through the capillary system, finally
    returning back through venous circulation back to the heart. Over several cardiac
    cycles, the kidneys will start to filter contrast agent from the bloodstream,
    excreting it into the bladder.

    which have a characteristic pattern of perfusion. To capture this, imaging protocols
    are timed to capture the precise moments that contrast agent is passing through

    preference of the radiologist who ordered the exam. Protocols are also periodically
    updated. This means that there is a high likelihood that if you are combining
    exams from different patient cohorts, different hospitals, or different scanners,
    you will have inconsistent combinations of contrast exams in your dataset.

- en: There are two ways to handle this. If you are using the CT for its intended
    application (e.g., you are training a model on glioblastoma cases from head CTs),
    decide exactly which CT contrast phases you will include and enforce it as a selection
    criteria. For example, you may require that all glioblastoma cases must have BOTH
    precontrast and arterial phase contrast scan; if an exam doesn’t have that exact
    combination, it is excluded. Additional series are also excluded. This is typically
    a conversation I have with the radiologist when discussing study design.

- en: If you are using the CT for a incidental application, you can usually be more
    lenient. For example, our bone-density model, which segments the spine, was trained
    on all four contrast phase images. If the patient has multiple contrast phase
    series, we simply average the bone measurements from all phases. We have done
    extensive validation demonstrating that IV contrast has no effect on model accuracy,
    and only a slight effect on subsequent density measurements (no more than 10%
    error) which we acknowledge as a limitation of our current approach.

    generally well labeled. It is usually indicated in the series description in abbreviated
    form but these can be hard to interpret. There is a set of Tags in the DICOM header,
    starting with [*(0018, 0010) Contrast/Bolus Agent*](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/contrast-bolus)
    but I have found these to be inconsistently reported. The only reliable way I
    have found to accurately label contrast phase with 100% confidence is to read
    the images themselves.

    breakthroughs in deep learning. My colleague and good friend Gian Marco Conte
    has a [publication in the journal Radiology](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021203786)
    where he trained a GAN to synthesize missing MRI sequences for glioblastoma, a
    similar approach could be used to synthesize CT contrast phase.

    and can reassure that the use of contrast is painless. An IV line is placed in
    your arm prior to the procedure, during the exam itself when the contrast is pushed,
    it feels like a cold rush to your arm. Some people claim that they get a metallic
    taste in their mouth, but I’ve never experienced this.
