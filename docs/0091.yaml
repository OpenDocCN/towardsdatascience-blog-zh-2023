    should accept or reject the null hypothesis. The p-value measures the probability
    there is no relationship between variables. A low p-value gives evidence against
    the null hypothesis. P-values are often misinterpreted. For example, it often
    leads people to erroneously claim that a low p-value means there *is* a relationship
    between the variables. Claiming there is a relationship is slightly different
    from making a claim rejecting or accepting that there is no relationship. P-values
    provide evidence only in favor or against the null hypothesis. Specifically, a
    p-value < 0.05 is good. A p-value< 0.05 means there is a 5% probability that there
    is no relationship between the variables. Moreover, a small p-value can be interpreted
    as there is a small probability that the effect observed is due to chance.

- en: For example, if a drug company is testing a new drug in clinical trials, it
    may observe that the drug is effective at treating the symptoms of a specific
    illness. Despite these observations, there is a chance that the drug effect that
    is observed is due to chance and the drug is actually ineffective. To conclude
    that observation isn’t due to chance and represents a real effect, p-values can
    be used to measure the…
