    expertise. As data science enthusiasts, when we acquire a dataset to explore and
    analyze, we eagerly train and validate it using diverse [state-of-the-art models](https://medium.com/geekculture/whats-the-public-sentiment-under-inflationary-economic-environment-5edc899efa29)
    or employing [data-centric strategies](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/how-to-apply-data-centric-ai-mindset-to-text-classification-problems-b41656c70c16).

    all the tasks have been accomplished.

    *Credit_History_Age*. The [data stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_data)
    consists of the training data, followed by the drifted data. We expect that the
    algorithm will promptly identify the drift shortly after examining the entirety
    of the original data.

    final 500 points of the original data in blue, followed by the initial 500 points
    of the drifted data, depicted in green. The drifted data exhibits a slightly higher
    average value.

    64457, which is the 637th data point within the drifted data. In comparison, the
    K-S Test and PSI necessitate a larger number of data points to conclude the presence
    of a drift confidently. The better performance of ADWIN is a testament to its
    capability to monitor diverse features at speed and ease.

    can lead to model decay in production. We can proactively monitor and detect drift
    conditions using model performance metrics, statistical tests, and adaptive windowing
    techniques. Unlike participating in a one-time Kaggle competition, building a
    production-ready ML system is an iterative journey. It requires a mindset shift
    towards integrating comprehensive model monitoring to ensure a robust and consistently
    high-performance serving space.
