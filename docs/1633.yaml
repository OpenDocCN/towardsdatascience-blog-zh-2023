    and its VS Code extension for ML experimentation. In the [first part](/turn-vs-code-into-a-one-stop-shop-for-ml-experiments-49c97c47db27),
    I illustrated the entire setup of an ML project and demonstrated how to track
    and evaluate experiments within VS Code. In the [second part](/enhance-your-ml-experimentation-workflow-with-real-time-plots-434106b1a1c2),
    I showed how to use different types of plots, including live-plots, for experiment
    evaluation.

    project. However, you may have thought that setting it up would require a lot
    of work, for example, with defining pipelines and versioning data. Perhaps for
    your next quick experiment, this would be an overkill, and you decided not to
    give it a try. That would be a pity!

    your project will be fully tracked and reproducible —I understand that sometimes
    we are under a lot of pressure and need to experiment and iterate quickly. That
    is why in this article I will show you the bare minimum that is required to start
    tracking your experiments with DVC.
