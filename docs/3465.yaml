    Anyone in the data world will immediately recognize this and understand that this
    applies directly to achieving the “self-actualization of data,” which is clearly

    Likewise, the base level of the Self-Service Hierarchy of Needs is obvious — data
    collection. You need to have collected the data. Let’s take this a step further
    and say that your foundation needs to collect raw data from disparate sources.
    In the modern data world, this is the Extract and Load portion of ELT (Extract,
    Load, Transform), and results in what we’ll call a Data Lake, for simplicity sake.
    Note the differentiation between the traditional/older data warehousing concept

    us to go back to the disparate source databases if we needed raw source data.'

    social stability, predictability, and control. In our Self-Service Hierarchy,
    we achieve that predictability, stability, and control by cleaning and organizing
    our data as business models in our data warehouse. This often takes the form of
    multi-dimensional star schema models. With the raw source data from the lower
    Collection level, analysts might have to join lots of disparate tables together
    for customer data. In this level, that disparate data has been brought together
    in a common table, called the Customer Dimension. Also in this process, data is
    cleaned (duplicate, mismatching names for the same customer) and helpful calculations
    are pre-computed (e.g., first order date), allowing for much simpler SQL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end, we’ve established another level of safety and trust in the data,
    but also enabled a new group of analysts with self-service because they don’t
    need to know the business complexity of the underlying source data. Also very
    important to note, at this level we should see involvement from business domain
    owners. The transformation process is meant to support real business needs, so
    business owners must be involved. In the modern data world, we start to see “analytic
    engineers” as a critical role to support this hybrid need.

    and that business domain owners need to be heavily involved. The “universal semantic
    layer” can provide a single-source of truth that powers self-service analytics
    through data literacy, simplicity, and trust. Analysts can rely on business-friendly
    field and entity names, data catalog descriptions, and perhaps most importantly,
    they do not need to know how tables join to each other (or at least how to write
    the SQL). We also have access to critical things like data lineage (trace a field
    back to the source table), synonyms (you call it “sales”, I call it “revenue”),
    and data freshness (when was the data last refreshed).

    “Business Objects had this in the 90s.” We’ve not yet reached the “Analysis layer”
    (BI tool level). For many reasons, which are elaborated upon in the post linked
    above (“Semantic-free is the future of Business Intelligence”), it is critical
    that you do not stuff your business logic semantic layer into a BI tool. The “semantic

    on to your seats for Maslow’s self-esteem level. Here, he breaks needs into “lower”

    Far too many implementations involve exporting data from hand-written SQL on source
    databases or static BI reports, and importing that .CSV into Tableau. While you
    can choose to eat healthy at this all-you-can-eat buffet, the reality is often

    has to be serious collaboration with the idea that we’re working toward a “business-driven”
    data solution rather than a “data-driven” solution. Everything we do has to be
    with the business needs in mind. As we build, we need to think about how we can
    enable competency in our delivered product. In the data world, how can we enable
    “data literacy?” Sure, the business should know their data, but when we put their
    business through the technical grinder and then present it back to them, it’s
    not always as obvious as we think. We need to enable data-literacy with data catalogs
    and semantic layers. Finally, when we roll out our solutions, we can’t just do
    standard roll-out sessions and trainings that come off as lectures. We need to

    As I established earlier, the tools are not the solution. They’re not even close
    to 1/3rd of the solution. I think it’s something like 50% People, 30% Process,
    and only 20% Tools. Being a BI tool provider, that’s a rough outlook. Nevertheless,
    it’s true.
  prefs: []

    the overall people and process components. Clearly, they need to be intuitive
    so that they don’t require deep knowledge of how to use them, and I think that
    a lot of modern BI tools do that. One of the areas where I think they’re lacking
    is in the “plug-and-play.” As I mentioned earlier, we put too much business logic
    in our tools, so switching from one tool to another is a major lift. Not to mention
    the fact that many organizations have 3 or more BI tools, often accessing the
    same datasets. What we need to do is take that business logic out of the BI tool
    and push it down to a centralized semantic layer that all BI tools can plug in
    to.

    we start small and build up. We’re thinking of the thing we’re building in components,
    taking an agile approach to deliver on real business needs. We want a “quick win”
    in our first iteration so that we can compound on these positive results, getting
    more people bought in along the way.

    This is why we immediately establish standards and data governance, which provide
    a foundation and keep us laser focused on delivering quality, accurate and reliable
    data products. Tools like Github go a long way in supporting our standards and
    data governance.

    understand the what IT is delivering, even though it’s their data. Data catalogs
    can go a long way to support data literacy, but this can be tricky. Oftentimes,
    we end up with spreadsheet data dictionaries that get stale and wind up gathering
    dust. We need to move to a more dynamic and active data catalog that allows business
    users to take action on the data catalog entities, as well as provide feedback
    on definitions, etc. for continuous improvement.'

    to be established and maintained.'

    and working together to develop solutions, but also to provide critical feedback
    that will improve things. It is important to form some sort of DART (Data Analytics
    and Reporting Team) group that has a cross section of members from tech to business
    and meets regularly to work through issues.

    discuss things that did not work or needs to be improved. Without being too dogmatic,
    or making up KPI’s, we need to figure out a way to measure success. Are people
    happy with the results from this first iteration? Did we create an immediately
    useful data product? Then, we iterate and continuously improve on what worked
    and what did not work.

    note is that we are not going from zero self-service to a fully data-democratized
    organization. We’re trying to move the needle, bit by bit, and continuously improve
    to enable more people in the organization to be involved in data. To recap, here
    are the three ways we can focus this effort:'
