    a broader look at the organizational context, we have to balance our goals with
    other considerations.

- en: Acquiring and keeping data is the focus of a huge amount of our mental energy
    as data scientists. If you ask a data scientist “Can we solve this problem?” the
    first question most of us will ask is “Do you have data?” followed by “How much
    data do you have?” We want to collect data because it is the prerequisite for
    most of the kinds of work we want to do, in order to produce valuable models and
    beneficial results. We love to dig around in that data, learn what is really in
    there and what it means, find out how it was generated or collected, and learn
    generalizable conclusions from it.

- en: Taking a hard look at data privacy puts our habits and choices in a different
    context, however. Data scientists’ instincts and desires often work in tension
    with the needs of data privacy and security. Anyone who’s fought to get access
    to a database or data warehouse in order to build a model can relate. It can feel
    like there are wildly over-cautious barriers being thrown up in the way of us
    doing our jobs. After all, isn’t the reason we have the data to learn from it
    and model it? Even the best of us sometimes demonize the parts of our organization
    whose primary goals are in the privacy and security area and conflict with our
    wishes to splash around in the data lake.

- en: In reality, data scientists are not always the heroes and IT and security teams
    are not the villains. We are both working on important goals and can both get
    a little bit of tunnel vision in that pursuit. It helps to look at the perspectives
    of both roles to understand the tension in place and the competing interests.

- en: From the data science angle, having large volumes of data is frequently necessary
    to meet the goals of our work. To build a generalizable model, you need to have
    many, many examples of the kinds of data that your model will need to respond
    to in production. Hundreds of thousands or millions of cases is not an outrageous
    amount to look for, by any means. However, to really make this work, data scientists
    must spend a lot of time and energy interrogating that data. Having a whole lot
    of data is great, but if you don’t know what it really represents and its provenance,
    the battle to do effective data science will be very uphill.

- en: If we take the security-forward perspective, on the other hand, we have to admit
    that the larger the quantities of data we have — particularly if there are multiple
    systems of storage or processes influencing the data — the larger the risk of
    data breach. Essentially, the more data we have, the more the chance that some
    of it goes missing or gets accessed by someone inappropriately. In addition, more
    people having access to data means more opportunities for breach or data loss,
    because human beings are the biggest risk vector in the technology space. We’re
    the weak link in the chain.

- en: What does all this mean? I would argue that it leads us to need a middle ground.
    For one thing, the more data we have lying around, the lower the likelihood that
    we have actually done the work to understand it deeply, or that we even could
    with the time and tools at our disposal. If we just hoard everything indiscriminately,
    we actually put ourselves in a position where we can’t even understand all the
    data and we are simultaneously at peak risk of breach. If we store nothing, or
    not enough, we make it impossible to access the incredible value data science
    has to offer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, we need to figure out where this middle ground lives. Best practices in
    data engineering and data retention do exist, but we have to make a lot of spur
    of the moment decisions too. Having principles around how we think about data
    retention and usage are important to help guide us in these situations.

    a new role! I am the first senior machine learning engineer at DataGrail, a company
    that provides a suite of B2B services helping companies secure and manage their
    customer data. This has naturally put the questions of data storage and privacy
    to the front of my mind, and made me think about the experiences I’ve had across
    my own career in companies of varying maturity levels and how they handled data.

- en: It’s so easy for a company to become a data hoarder. You begin with a shortage
    of data, and you’re flying blind, collecting data about transactions, business
    activities, etc. as you go to help inform decisions and strategy. You may not
    be doing machine learning yet, but you can see the future potential, and you want
    to prepare the scene. It seems not only reasonable but vital to collect your data
    and store it! So, you set up data systems and start filling up those tables or
    topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This isn’t sustainable, though — not forever anyway. After a few years go by
    you can end up with huge volumes of data. Maybe you need to scale up to a cloud
    storage provider like Snowflake or AWS to keep up and make all this data accessible
    at the pace you need. You’re using the data, of course! Maybe you have begun a
    machine learning program, or even just advanced analytics and BI, but this is
    making a huge difference to your business’s effectiveness if done well. But even
    so, you’re going to start having to think about the cost of the infrastructure,
    not to mention probably hiring data engineering staff to help manage the beast.
  prefs: []

- en: Unfortunately, you have also started to acquire data that you don’t have a good
    handle on anymore. Documentation may be falling out of date, if it ever existed
    at all, and the staff who helped build out the original systems years ago could
    be turning over. What does this table mean? What is the provenance of that column?
    Data that isn’t interpretable generates little value if any, because you can’t
    effectively learn from data you don’t understand.

- en: At this point you have decisions to make. How are you going to strategically
    plan for the future of your data systems? You probably need to attend to data
    architecture to try and keep costs from skyrocketing, but what about data retention?
    Do you keep all data forever? If not, what do you cut and when? Remember, however,
    that retaining a pretty large volume of data is a non-negotiable requirement if
    your business will have effective machine learning and/or analytics functions
    supporting your decisionmaking and products. “Throw it all out and avoid any of
    this nonsense” is not an option.

- en: At the same time, you need to be thinking about the regulatory and legal frameworks
    that apply to having all this data. What are you going to do if a customer asks
    you to delete all the data you have about them, as some jurisdictions allow? Many
    organizations don’t take this seriously until they’re already late to the party.
    If you’re going to be on top of it, and you didn’t start from day 1, you have
    the tough task ahead of retrofitting your data architecture to handle the regulatory
    requirements this data is subject to.

- en: The growth in data security regulations in recent years has increased the challenges
    of the scenario I describe for businesses. In some ways, it was our own doing
    — numerous data breaches, lax security, and opaque consent policies by assorted
    companies over recent years have led to public demand for better, and government
    filled the gap. It appears that brand trust and safety weren’t enough motivation
    on their own to get many businesses to tighten up the ship where data protection
    was concerned. If laws were necessary to ensure that our personal data and sensitive
    records are protected conscientiously, then I for one am all for it.

- en: However, in my data scientist hat, I have to acknowledge the tension that I
    started with in this column. I want all the data, and I want to be able to dig
    around in it unrestrained, because that’s how I do my job effectively. But, I
    also am a customer and a citizen and I want MY data to be carefully protected.
    I know that the promise and power of machine learning depends on data being available
    to use, but it naturally feels a little less clear when you consider that it’s
    data about you and your habits that is feeding the progress. I find this role
    a bit easier to embody than “security” per se, because I’m not a trained data
    security professional, but I don’t need to be to have a strong sense of what my
    preferences as a consumer would be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My advice is that we keep our consumer/security hats and our data scientist
    hats both close at hand. We have to maintain a balance between accumulating data
    for machine learning and limiting our data retention for customer privacy and
    data security. There’s no silver bullet answer to “how much should we keep?”,
    so the only choice is to juggle both interests in every decision we make about
    data storage.
