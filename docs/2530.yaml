    And while the stress of driving deadlines and managing, at times, complex situations
    can always have a spin of “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” it can be
    avoided, and the learning can happen in a fun environment of delivering something
    big together.

    Ask the team to scope the work and come up with a date. Deadlines don’t help,
    but they help — they are a mental anchor for the team members in planning the
    work, making it more focused.

    appropriate for the moment. Features might come at the cost of short-term thinking

    were cut and allocate the time after the deadline to polish the project.

    but also keep you accountable. If a problem is flagged early enough, management
    would have time to provide resources to aid the delivery. Visibility and transparency
    in decision-making also make it easier to criticize you, helping shape a better
    solution.

- en: Higher management doesn’t have time to dive deep; however, they will have a
    better view of the current direction and priorities. When providing information
    or potential development options to higher management, don’t dive into too many
    details. Keeping reports concise and to the point, lots of visuals, high-level
    overview and real-world analogies, flagging problems early are the ingredients
    for satisfied management.
  prefs:

    several options and ask to pick one. Almost have a pre-decision, e.g. we want
    to go with X because it is AB and C; however, Y has DEF, but in the long term,
    this would not matter. Are you happy with us to proceed with A?

    The best way to keep them this way is to stay tuned and be open to feedback. Proactively
    ask for feedback, especially negative — drop a message and say you are open to
    communication — build trust. Subconsciously, people would pick things up and let
    you know before they might blow up.
