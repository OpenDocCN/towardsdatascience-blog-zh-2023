    and expect a reliable solution.

    approach any problem with an ML-based solution in mind.

    I can assure you that you do not want unprecedented results in production.

    and foremost requirement in any ML system is data. Before considering if we can
    apply ML to a problem, we need to make sure we have access to data.

    to the data we want to predict.
