    imaging](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/measuring-coffee-grind-distribution-d37a39ffc215).
    This has been so useful in diving deeper into what is going on with a coffee grinder,
    and I really enjoyed the challenge of the image processing required. However,
    I was always curious how these measurements compared to laser diffraction. Laser
    diffraction is typically very expensive, but I had an opportunity to run a few
    samples and compare to my method.

- en: '[**Laser diffraction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diffraction_analysis)for
    particle distribution uses a laser and a diffraction grating to more accurately
    measure small particles. It outputs the average diameter of the particle, and
    a typical laser particle analyzer uses a feed tube to measure particles sequentially.
    A probability distribution is then made based on the volume of the particles.
    These machines cost around $100,000, which is not economical for coffee hobby
    explorations.'

    a sample of coffee on a piece of paper, spreading out / declumping the coffee
    grounds, and taking a calibrated image. A calibrated image means the image plane
    can translate to a real measurement of size.

    than particle diameter. However, I would love to have both the high accuracy of
    laser imaging and the particle shape information from camera imaging.

    clumps much less, but it is not always representative of the grinder.

- en: In looking at all the bins, it is clear that the cumulative distribution can
    not be looked at without removing the lower bins for the laser technique. In this
    way there is more alignment, but a better test could have also sifted the coffee
    grounds to be able to insure the measurement between laser and imaging was the
    same particle type.

- en: In my usual imaging measurement, I use the minimum diameter as that is what
    a sifter will measure. However, to get closer to the lasered measurement, I looked
    at minimum and average diameter. The average diameter seems to fit a bit better
    for larger particles over 100um, but the minimum diameter fits better for particles
    less than 100um.

- en: I will stick with average diameter because that is closer to what the laser
    measurement is providing. I can look at a grind before and after the shot. The
    imaged data shows the post-shot particles get a little finer while the lasered
    shows the opposite. I wonder if this is tied to the accuracy at the lower readings.

    be a flat line if they were the same.

- en: These results still show a gap in performance, but imaging is seemingly within
    range of lasered data. I don’t usually compare these distributions to laser diffraction
    measurements, so within the same method, the variables are more controlled than
    comparing to another measurement type.
  prefs: []

- en: I still prefer to have the precision of the laser measurement for the 3D shape
    as well as the actual 3D shape to better understand a grinder, and that may one
    day happen if someone made a desktop laser diffraction particle analyzer.
