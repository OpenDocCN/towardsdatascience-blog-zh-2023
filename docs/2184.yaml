    (**size**) by the precision of these values (**data type**). However, to save

    is a solution to the outlier problem. It relies on a vector-wise (absmax) quantization

    We started by gaining an understanding of floating point representation, before
    introducing two techniques for 8-bit quantization: **absmax** and **zero-point
    quantization**. However, their limitations, particularly when it comes to handling
    outliers, led to **LLM.int8()**, a technique that also preserves the model’s performance.
    This approach underlines the progress being made in the field of weight quantization,
    revealing the importance of properly addressing outliers.'

    technique in depth. This technique, introduced by [Frantar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323),
    only utilizes 4 bits and represents a significant advancement in the field of
    weight quantization. We will provide a comprehensive guide on how to implement
    GPTQ using the AutoGPTQ library.
