    in recent years. From chatbots and virtual assistants to machine translation and
    sentiment analysis, NLP technologies are now being used in a wide variety of applications
    across a range of industries. With the increasing demand for technologies that
    can process human language, investors have been eager to get a piece of the action.
    In this article, we look at NLP start-up funding over the past year, identifying
    the applications and domains that have received investment.

    a newsletter on the commercial application of NLP tools and techniques (subscribe
    for free [here](https://www.language-technology.com/twin)!), I track company funding
    and acquisitions in the natural language processing space. In 2022, I found just
    over 340 relevant funding events, ranging from pre-seed funding all the way through
    to late-stage Series E and F rounds. In this article, I focus in on early-stage
    companies: specifically, those who reported pre-seed funding, seed funding or
    Series A funding rounds. Companies at this stage have yet to establish their products
    or services in the marketplace, and can unambiguously be described as startups;
    they constitute the highest risk for investors, and at the same time we might
    expect them to be an excellent source of innovative ideas. In the data I have
    available, just over 50% of the funding events were at the pre-seed, seed or Series
    A stage; in this article, I attempt to impose some organisation and structure
    over the offerings of these 173 companies, with the aim of highlighting the technology
    and application areas that have been considered worthy of investment over the
    last twelve months.'

    devoid of insight. So, the present article is organised around a taxonomisation
    of the space of NLP startups that is intended to be useful to those who are interested
    in this area. There are many ways such a space could be structured, so I’m not
    claiming that the set of categories used here is the only way to do this; it’s
    simply a map of the space that makes sense to me, and may make it easier for you
    to determine what sections of the article are most relevant to you.

    by application type or, alternatively, by domain of application, viewing these

    I think it’s more informative and useful to adopt a slightly uncomfortable hybrid
    that picks out a hierarchy of technology types, but leaves a proportion of the
    companies we review as better organised in terms of domain of application. So,
    this article is structured as follows:'

    but they’re not; there’s leakage and boundary crossing in various places, so you
    might well not agree with where I’ve chosen to place particular companies. In
    particular, there are a few companies discussed in Sections 3, 4 and 5 which could
    easily have been considered domain-specific applications, but in the interest
    of identifying clusters of activity it seemed to me more useful to include them
    under technology types.

    technology appears to play an important role in that product or service. There
    are, inevitably, borderline cases; for example, many web-based products now incorporate
    a simple chatbot functionality, but I consider these in-scope only if the chatbot
    is an important feature or does something interesting and new.

    of each company’s website at the time of writing. But things can change quickly,
    and companies can pivot quite significantly, so depending on when you are reading
    this, any given company’s website might now be telling a different story. Also,
    I’ve tried to make each description as informative as possible in a short space,
    usually no more than one sentence; but there are a few cases where I’ve spent
    what felt like just too much time and effort on a website trying to get a clear
    idea of what a company’s offering is, with limited success, resulting in unhappily
    vague descriptions.

    based outside the US and received their funding in other currencies; USD equivalents
    shown here are based on the exchange rates at the time of writing, and so may
    vary a little from figures that were reported at the time of funding.

    that have to contend with physical formatting issues in documents (like, for example,
    the extraction of information from tables), while ‘text processing’ is typically
    more concerned with a document’s linguistic content, abstracted away from its
    physical rendering. My impression, however, is that an increasing number of solutions
    are combining these two paradigms, so I consider them here as a single combined
    category.

    as having over 80% of search engine usage — investors still think search is worth
    pumping money into. Much of the activity here doesn’t compete directly with Google,
    being more oriented towards enterprise search and other specific uses cases, but
    just as this piece was being written, it was reported that [Google’s management

    in response to the appearance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT question-answering chatbot,
    and a worry that such approaches could reinvent or replace the traditional internet
    search engine. Notably, [You.com was quick to integrate a ChatGPT-like model and
    interface into its search engine](https://venturebeat.com/ai/as-google-weighs-in-on-chatgpt-you-com-enters-the-ai-chat/);

    in order to generate value. I suspect we’ll see further advances in the combination
    of Intelligent Character Recognition and LLM-based text processing, although it’s

    shift, with the template-based technologies prominent in the last decade now appearing

    they now struggle to be considered a part of AI. Those earlier approaches will
    still have a role for the foreseeable future, but they are increasingly far from
    the cutting edge. Of course, we still have to overcome the problem that large
    language models are not reliable sources of truth.

    productivity tools. As noted above, these are often multi-party variants of tools

    a fatigued or inattentive human editor lets through a gross unfactuality in an
