    effective usage of business data. Yet, the democratization of data, or lack thereof,
    is also [named among the top challenges](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1267748/data-challenges-business-value-organizations/)
    to deriving more value from using data in organizations across USA and Europe.

    hype for data democratization justified? To answer these questions, we need to
    look at what obstacles businesses and other organizations face when attempting
    to democratize data and what success factors for democratization need to be addressed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As is the case for many relatively novel concepts, the definition of data democratization
    has not stabilized yet and might be understood slightly differently by various
    users of the term. Often, the democratization of data will be defined as enabling
    end-users within the organization to access more data on their own. As we shall
    see, this broad definition is not enough to capture the essence of democratization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simply giving the employees access to more data will not make them actually
    use data more or get better results. The definition of data democratization must
    include not only superficial access to data but also actual, practical, and ongoing
    empowerment of the employees to constantly use data and improve their analytical
    skill set. Therefore, the term “self-service analytics” might grasp the essence
    of such an intra-organizational open data framework more accurately than “data
    democratization.”

    [Citizen data scientists](https://core.ac.uk/reader/326836340), defined as domain
    experts who are also capable of using and manipulating data proficiently, are
    crucial for a business to achieve such efficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the one hand, citizen data scientists take the mundane data management tasks
    off of the hands of professional data scientists, allowing the latter to concentrate
    on higher-level duties. On the other hand, domain experts can also do their job
    faster when, instead of requesting data-related services, they are able to fetch
    and work on data themselves.

    [more than 50% of the data](https://www.tessi.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/human-interactive-guide-dark-data-web-2023-en.pdf)
    gathered during various company procedures is stored yet unutilized, taking up
    storage space, exaggerating data security and management costs, and burning electricity.
    Providing wider access to company data can significantly reduce the volume of
    dark data and create opportunities for extracting value from what is now only
    a burden.

    at the data, better and well-rounded decisions are bound to be made. Individual
    bias and preconceptions that form due to particular professional backgrounds would
    have less of an effect, making data-based reasoning more versatile and objective.

    Aside from the direct benefits of improved skill sets and operational speed, such
    empowerment also boosts the morale of the workers, who now have a deeper understanding
    of the big picture and their role within it.

    analytics better by comparing them to the ones that obstruct the sustaining of

    by governmental bodies. However, without established procedures, comprehensible
    cataloging, and digital infrastructure, few will see the records locked away in
    vast archives.

- en: Similarly, just granting data access to more employees will not do much to expand
    the set of data users. Creating an effective data democracy requires not simply
    formal freedom but also substantial resources to use data. It includes providing
    employees with analytical tools that would allow them to work on internal data
    or even collect additional publicly available information useful to completing
    their tasks.

    a custom solution that would have an SQL interface for experienced data users
    as well as some sort of “drag and drop” function for beginners. Such tools do
    exist, but they require well-documented data modeling. At Oxylabs, we chose Apache
    Superset, however, there is no “one size fits all” solution, and every organization
    must look for a tool that best fits their employee skills and needs.

    crucial to effective democracy of all kinds. Thus, proper training and opportunities
    for sharing practical, legal, and ethical data-related knowledge should be established.
    Without all this, there is a risk that employees will fail to use open data or,
    worse, interpret data in a wrong way, drawing incorrect conclusions.

    data and uses the same definitions (such as what is “active user” or “product
    sale”) creates a lot of additional work for data teams — the primary challenge
    that data democratization should actually solve.

    the form of accepting data protection as every employee’s shared responsibility.
    When managing and sharing data is the exclusive domain of IT and data specialists,
    the responsibility to ensure the quality, security, and compliance of these procedures
    also falls into their hands. This might be preferable to a considerable part of
    the workforce, as new forms of responsibility can be scary.

    them to do it in a safe and responsible way. The aforementioned all-around training
    in data regulation and cybernetic security is crucial for achieving this goal.
    [Airbnb showed a good example](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine-Legner-2/publication/354906721_Data_democratization_toward_a_deeper_understanding/links/61539051fd7b3d1215599a07/Data-democratization-toward-a-deeper-understanding.pdf)

    previously, the company opened internal data access by launching a data exploration
    tool called Dataportal.

    are complemented by internal data training. For companies that decide to follow
    this road, the most important factor to consider is whether data democratization
    should involve all their employees in the same way (which is rarely the case).
    Often, organizations benefit from separating employees into different target groups
    or personas that have different data access rights and receive custom education.

    decision-making is vital — failing to develop a fitting culture can render favorable
    material conditions ineffective. Even if all necessary tools are available and
    most employees are ready to take up data security responsibilities, democratization
    will fail without an organization-wide cultural shift. Such a shift underlies
    the following [success factors](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2212/2212.03059.pdf)
