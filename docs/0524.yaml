- en: Transformer models [introduced in 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) have
    led to a breakthrough in solving hard language related tasks. Variations of the
    original transformer architecture in models like BERT, GPT, etc. trained on large
    amounts of text data have produced state of the art results on language related
    tasks.

    needed domain expertise and careful perusal — faster and at a fraction of the
    cost. I believe this will revolutionize industries in the coming decade.

- en: 'A typical task is extracting information from text. Question Answering is a
    powerful information extraction tool, whereby models can be trained to extract
    specific bits of information through complex queries. Think about the potential
    time and money saved by AI models in answering hard questions from legal documents,
    instead of asking an experienced lawyer or hiring an intern to pour over the document
    for hours. Let’s take a dive into the 2 basic types of AI based QA: Extractive
    vs Abstractive.'
