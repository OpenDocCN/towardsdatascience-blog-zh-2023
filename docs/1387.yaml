- en: What separates a standout data analyst from a good one? I often think about
    this as I reflect on my own experiences leading and learning from a number of
    analysts over the years. The answer always seems to tie back to specific themes
    around mindset, approach, and systems, as opposed to mastery in any one technical
    domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A strong technical skill set is significantly more effective when combined with
    habits across the themes described below. I will use a few examples to highlight
    how anyone, with a certain amount of planning and care, can incorporate similar
    behaviors into their own workflows. Some of these themes are related but we will
    go through each of them separately for clarity. The examples are based on analytics
    in the music streaming domain, but the underlying takeaways are applicable across
    industries.

- en: 'Most of us may know the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
    or the 80/20 rule. At its simplest, it highlights how a small number of items
    can have an outsized impact on the final objective or outcome. For example:'

    This principle is just as appropriate when evaluating the most impactful areas
    of your work. There will always be a small set of definitions, metrics, queries,
    or other items that are the most critical to know, inside out, at any given point
    in time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data analysts who are quick to identify what this 20 is for them, and take the
    time to learn it deeply, stand out. Let us assume that you recently began working
    with the Paid Subscriptions team. This team is responsible for growing the number
    of paying customers and the overall subscription revenue for the company. They
    rely heavily on your analytical opinion and actively ask you for data and guidance
    during team discussions.

    set of data points that you need to know at your fingertips. These data points
    are so fundamental to this domain that they come up in almost every discussion.

    minutes every day to study them. You keep repeating this process until the data

- en: At first glance, this may look like a lot of information to remember, but it
    becomes very doable with some attention, planning, and repetition. It is less
    important to know the exact numbers off the top of your head than it is to have
    a strong sense of their ballpark levels and relative rankings. Since the actual
    values for a lot of these metrics are unlikely to change drastically week over
    week, the time spent on learning them will serve you well for an extended period
    of time.
  prefs: []

- en: This is not to say that you should never refer to relevant dashboards or reports
    in real-time. Doing that on occasion is necessary. However, it is much harder
    to get ahead of the game and actively participate in conversations if you have
    to refer to a document for every data point. Knowing your 20 inside out will help
    you avoid this and be more present.

- en: (3) Anticipation & Proactivity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As analysts and data scientists, we are often quite excited about building models
    and making predictions. However, we don’t spend nearly enough time exercising
    this predictive ability when planning our own days or weeks. It helps to have
    a pulse on the items that haven’t been asked for *yet*, but arelikely to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to anticipate and proactively share an analysis, model, or simply
    an email, can go a long way in earning trust and building credibility. Let us
    go over a straightforward example of this in practice. Suppose you created an
    automated email report that multiple teams rely on to track daily growth and engagement
    metrics. When a metric in this email drops significantly, several teams pause
    their ongoing work to understand what happened.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let us assume that it is right around Christmas, and you remember from
    a previous analysis that there is a seasonal drop in the number of listeners in
    the first week of every year. To avoid anxious colleagues reaching out to you
    for an explanation after the fact, you could get ahead of it and proactively send
    out an email with the required context before the drop takes place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communicating this may seem obvious in hindsight, but it often doesn’t happen
    in practice. Most of us do a great job responding to incoming questions or requests
    but pay less attention to proactive delivery. A simple shift in the timing of
    an action can dramatically change how well it is received.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anticipation and proactivity are two sides of the same coin. Being able to anticipate
    a need without taking any proactive action will have no external impact. It may
    help you validate your thought process but will do little else. Similarly, to
    be proactive in a manner that is useful and relevant, anticipation is key.

- en: (4) Empathy
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given how much has already been written about the importance of communication
    as a data analyst, I want to focus our attention on a quality that is a prerequisite
    for effective communication — empathy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    A deep understanding of your stakeholder’s priorities, pain points, strengths,
    and weaknesses, will increase your effectiveness significantly.

- en: Imagine you are a data analyst working with the Editorial team. This team is
    responsible for curating playlists across various genres, moods, and other topics.
    The head of this department reaches out to you with — *“Hey, can you please share
    a list of all playlists by their number of weekly streams and listeners? Thank
    you!”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of jumping right into a SQL query or a dashboard, you dig deeper to
    understand the underlying motivation behind the request. Through clarifying questions
    and further conversation, it becomes clear that what the team is actually trying
    to determine is the playlists with the most repeat listening and engagement so
    they can create more similarly themed playlists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this deeper understanding of the team’s need, you decide to add playlist
    listener retention and skip rate metrics to your report as well. In addition,
    since each Editor is focused on creating playlists for a specific language, you
    also provide the ability to filter your report by each language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this situation, simply providing what was initially asked for may have been
    satisfactory to the Editorial team, but it would have resulted in an inferior
    end product. Being empathetic to the team’s needs improved the quality and actionability
    of your work.

- en: I am sure we have all responded to or heard someone respond to an interview
    question with something along the lines of, “I am a quick learner” or “I don’t
    know that, but I can learn it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most data analysts convey the desire to learn a new skill or build expertise
    in a new area. However, it is not the desire or curiosity to learn, but the approach
    to learning that is the key differentiator. Individuals who treat learning as
    an ongoing journey instead of an occasional ad-hoc task stand out over extended
    periods as their knowledge and skill set compound.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For many, the act of learning is completely dependent on whether there is a
    need for it at work. This, however, gives your work all the control over what
    and how much you learn. This is not a reliable long-term strategy. It may work
    well in the first few months of a new job where there is a lot to learn, but it
    will become less effective over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, an “always on” learning mindset would mean consistently spending
    a small amount of time daily or weekly getting better at something. This something
    may or may not be tied to what you are doing at work at the time. This makes the
    relationship between work and learning less rigid or transactional and more sustainable
    over the years. In certain cases, work will dictate what you need to learn, while
    in others, what you learn will influence your roadmap at work.

    enough in isolation. Combining a strong technical skill set with habits and behaviors
    across the five themes can be a game changer.
