    this as I reflect on my own experiences leading and learning from a number of
    analysts over the years. The answer always seems to tie back to specific themes

    habits across the themes described below. I will use a few examples to highlight
    how anyone, with a certain amount of planning and care, can incorporate similar

    go through each of them separately for clarity. The examples are based on analytics
    in the music streaming domain, but the underlying takeaways are applicable across
