    where I only really had qualitative data at my disposal.And so I adapted — I’ve
    steadily learned to sculpt reasonable decisions from highly ambiguous clay. But

    right. It doesn’t tell you to do something, but it can close off forks in the
    road. It’s never tantamount to a decision, but it can act as an accelerant to
    one. It can’t tell you what to do, but it can speak for your customers when they
    themselves stay silent. It isn’t *the* answer, but it can simplify understanding
    and provide clarity that makes it easier to see *an* answer. Data has helped me
    navigate ambiguity in the same way that qualitative data does. I see the data,
    I adjust my priors accordingly, and I walk down a different route of the idea
    maze. And in that capacity, it’s been *invaluable*.

    data as a data practitioner. When your entire world is data, it’s easy to think
    that’s [all there is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).
    But it’s important to understand the role of our work so we can better fit into
    decision-making conversations. We should never force decisions, but increasing
    our contextual understanding can help us make useful recommendations. You’re sitting
    in the passenger seat, and if you know where you’re going, you can help route

    of my advice thus far is your biggest blocker at this point. To make this a bit
    clearer, let’s reconsider the story from the start of this post if things went
    a little differently. Once again, your stakeholder wants to know how many kinds
    of litter boxes you carry. Instead of jumping to a query, **you** [**ask why**](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/why-youre-doing-ad-hoc-analytics-wrong-49d177202c7a).
    It turns out the executive wants to pick some categories for the homepage. You
    offer suggestions around recommendation systems, but she complains that’s too
    much. Realizing she has a tight timeline for delivery, you tell her you’ll build
    a quick dashboard so you can look at the data together, then make a coherent decision
    based on that information. She agrees. You pull additional metrics on top of sheer
    count she initially requested — clickthrough rate, order rate, average ratings.
    You even define a new metric: % of low exposure items. You share the data with
    your stakeholder, alongside your recommendations.'

    understand the basis of your stakeholder’s objections to **reach an optimal decision**.
    From a deep discussion, together, you form hypotheses that blend your quantitative
    findings and her qualitative intuition, and these become the basis of robust category
    creation. You write up an analysis that’s linked in her product strategy document.
    The choices she made are vastly improved, and you feel like you’ve genuinely changed
    the arc of cat furniture history.

    the qualitative data as well, deeply understanding the objective they’re trying
    to accomplish. They own the responsibility of melding their insights into the
    decision-making process. They understand the objective function: an [intellectually
    honest decision](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/analytics-is-not-about-data-its-about).
