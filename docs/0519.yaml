    or even confusing? Does your plot convey the story or message that you’re trying
    to communicate without any ambiguity? These are some questions you want to ask
    when you make a data visualization.

    learned. As a data scientist, you’re likely handling data constantly and in high
    volumes, and visualization becomes a key to communicating your findings. While
    a scatter plot is really good to show trends and correlations, the fact is that
    with more data, you get more outliers. With a scatter plot, every single point
    is represented equally; outliers show up just as clearly as points that contribute
    to the trend, and if you have enough, they can completely obstruct the important
    data.

    up is to filter everything through some ML algorithm and plot the results rather
    than the raw data. While that’s certainly useful, it isn’t…
