- en: I have three cats. I love all of them, but I have to admit they have different
    intelligence levels. The smartest one’s name is MaoMao. Recently, I noticed MaoMao
    has picked up a new habit. Whenever I am eating lunch, he sits next to me. I’d
    like to believe he loves me and wants to spend time with me, but his aloof personality
    suggests otherwise. I also notice he is alert when sitting next to me, constantly
    looking for something. After some observations, I realize he is waiting for a
    sunlight reflection to chase. You know how cats are crazy about lasers, light
    reflections, etc. The dining table receives full sunlight at noon, and sometimes,
    the reflection of my watch appears on nearby walls or ceilings.

- en: Maomao has picked the pattern — — whenever I sit by the desk, there would be
    a light to chase. My other two cats haven’t figured out this pattern yet but have
    their own strategy. Whenever they hear the noises made by MaoMao chasing the light,
    they know the light has come and will soon join the chase. I watch them play every
    time when I am having lunch, the most relaxing activity recovering from busy mornings.
