- en: I started my first full-time data science job in January 2018 as an Associate
    Product Analyst. This is the 7th year of my DS career, now as a Senior Data Scientist.
    Six years passed very fast (especially with the pandemic). I worked for two companies,
    supported at least 10 different teams, collaborated with partners on product,
    engineering, design, finance, and operations, and touched various data science
    realms including data pipelining, dashboarding, metrics review, deep dive analysis,
    A/B testing, and modeling.

- en: When I was at school, I used to be fascinated with technical skills. I spent
    lots of time learning and exploring different machine learning models and participated
    in Kaggle competitions. However, since I started working in the industry, I realized
    there is way more I need to worry about than writing codes and building fancy
    models, and some of those things are actually more important.
