    scientist, a lot of these resources suffer from what I like to call “the curse

    that point, I had a bit over two years of experience as a data analyst), there
    were a lot of rejections in almost all of the stages. I probably made hundreds
    of applications in order to have only a couple move into the next stage. Even
    for those applications that passed the screening process, there were a lot of
    rejections before I managed to get my first offer. In fact, there were times that
    I decided to abandon the process altogether (sometimes even for months), being
    convinced that my dream of becoming a data scientist was not attainable. Sometimes
    I wish I could go back in time and help myself navigate through the complexities
    and unknowns of the data science interview funnel and save some of that lost time.

    to five stages. Although these will be slightly different based on the type of
    data scientist you want to be and the company you apply for, the building blocks
    will be the same.

    pool to a smaller group of individuals that will be invited “inside the house”.

    not all stages will be present in every interview process):'

    you are given all the ammunition you need to forge the right key. Most job descriptions
    will already list these keywords, so what is left for you is to a) identify which
    roles are right for you, b) pick up the common keywords and required skills, and
    c) make sure they are clearly stated in your CV. Trust that simple process and

    effort put into the different stages, or did it look like a hasty effort? Did
    they evaluate you on what you would expect? Did they take the time and effort
    to give you feedback? Even if you don’t get hired today in that role, you can
    always put an asterisk on the company for future applications, indicating a place
    to avoid or a place to look for.

    **the only way to improve is by practising**. Similarly to the first time you
