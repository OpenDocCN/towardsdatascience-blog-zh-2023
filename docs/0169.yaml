- en: It was back in 2015 and I was creating some data visualizations for a meeting
    with my PhD supervisory committee. This was towards the end of my graduate studies
    in astrophysics and I had run some supercomputer simulations of a massive star
    forming inside an interstellar cloud of gas.

    create various animations of the data. My analysis code had chewed through gigabytes
    of simulation data and dumped image files at specific time intervals. So I used
    `ffmpeg` to stitch them together into an animation:'

    animation, but I was limited by the data I had from my simulation.

    frames to make my movies *appear* smoother when I compiled them. My attempts at
    the time were clumsy and ultimately abandoned, but today there are many techniques
    that work very well. In fact, most modern TVs include the option (on by default)
    to artificially enhance the frame rate of the video.
