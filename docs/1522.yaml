    two things are generally true: there are no real shortcuts, and people’s learning
    rhythm can vary dramatically. Even with these constraints in place, though, there
    are ways to make the process more efficient and to achieve the goals we’ve set
    for ourselves within a reasonable timeframe.'

    can apply throughout their learning journey, regardless of their experience level
    or career stage. If you’re looking for study hacks and problem-solving tricks
    that could fit into a tweet, you’ll likely be disappointed (see above: no shortcuts!).
    Instead, the focus here is on developing better habits, building robust info-gathering
    workflows, and maximizing the knowledge you already possess.'

    decided to become an industry data scientist, and his post about adapting an existing
    skill set to a new role is particularly useful for others considering an academia-to-industry
    transition. Its insights on skill transferability, however, are applicable for
    any data practitioner who needs to close a major knowledge gap in order to advance
    their career.'
