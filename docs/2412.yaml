    a blog post about it from a philosophical and artistic standpoint. As a data scientist
    and hobbyist printmaker, I was intrigued to learn how this method is viewed and
    used for artistic reasons.

    more light on other aspects such as artistic, aesthetic, and social considerations,
    which often receive less attention. The main motivation behind this exploration
    was to better understand and explore in what sense DALL·E2 is artistic and possesses
    human-like qualities. In other words, how should we interpret DALL·E2 output?
  prefs: []

    consequences for employment. The images it generates are so appealing that it
    can be difficult to tell if they were generated by a human or an algorithm. For
    example, we just witnessed an AI-generated photo that [won a photography prize](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated),

    capacities. For instance, humans can automatically create art, but the key question
    is whether the art has aesthetic value. Criteria can be devised to determine whether
    or not an artwork has such merit. One criterion, I feel, is how sensitive an artwork
    is to context.

    discern contrasts between different cultures. For instance, if a Mozart piece
    was presented in the 12th century or the 21st, its aesthetic value could vary
    significantly because it is innately tied to the context in which it was produced
    since it is inherently linked to the context in which it was created.

    piece is art. It merely exhibits impressive imitation capabilities.'

- en: One possible approach to understand DALL·E2 is using the concept of ‘Literal
    Meaning’. Humans have the ability to discern whether a language use is correct,
    even if it hasn’t been explicitly defined or its conditions of truth explicitly
    outlined. John Searle, an American philosopher who is widely known for his contributions
    to the philosophy of language, contests the notion of ‘Literal Meaning’ (which
    is basically a straightforward and direct interpretation of a sentence, without
    any figurative or metaphorical elements).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of meaning is intrinsically linked to..well, context. The issue
    at hand is whether it’s possible to provide a description including the necessary
    and sufficient conditions for a certain term to apply to a worldly object. Furthermore,
    whether our comprehension of the definition (or a computer’s comprehension for
    that matter) will be precise enough to correctly apply or use the term in a conversational
    context we’ve neither contemplated nor encountered before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We understand a sentence despite our vocabulary and the extent to which we’ve
    used the term being finite. The instances of using the term based on memory are
    definitive and limited. Now, an example that illustrates this involves the definition
    of the concept ‘on’ in the article titled ‘Literal Meaning.’ Let’s consider a
    phrase we’d like to understand — “the cat is on the carpet,” or “the cat is on
    the floor.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is there a way to accurately deduce the semantically necessary and sufficient
    conditions for appropriately associating these terms with a cat and a rug in order
    to describe such a situation? To affirm that a cat is on a carpet, what fraction
    of it must be on the carpet? How are we defining that portion? One leg? Three
    legs? And what if it’s two legs on and two off the carpet?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can we precisely determine when it would be correct to say the cat is on the
    carpet? Let’s illustrate further. Imagine flying in space where you see a cat
    and rug positioned upside down. The cat appears inverted, but who’s on what? Realize
    how we’ve used the term ‘on’ with the presumption of a background — Earth’s gravity.
    This unconscious usage merely exemplifies how much context underlies our statements
    and our comprehension of statements and terms. Our declarations always presuppose
    a background that is never explicitly stated or fully fleshed out.

    and order a coke and a hamburger. Suddenly, you’re given a 5-meter hamburger and
    a 2-meter glass of coke. Is this what you ordered? Probably no, but how did you
    specify this in your order? Anyone who understands the context — “what it means
    to buy a hamburger” — knows that this is not what you ordered. And this context
    obviously varies across cultures.

    exploring others. Art is layered historically, demanding an understanding of its
    roots and foundations. When a computer succeeds in initiating a new movement in
    art — that is, when critics or experts exclaim, “Wow! We have never witnessed
    anything like this before” — and if this movement genuinely hails from understanding
    the historical state of art, integrates aptly, and initiates a change, then that
    is significant. When that happens, and it successfully crafts poetry that redefines
    how poetry itself is understood, as Borges stated — after Kafka’s works, people
    suddenly discovered numerous pre-existing Kafkas.

    universally accepted innovation. They might think it’s too nebulous or indefinable.
    True, art is continually being debated. In today’s world, however, academics referencing
    a modern text can distinguish it from a non-modern text. Hermeneutics (the theory
    of interpretation) is concerned with this. This is a key concern for anyone attempting
    to parse meanings between texts. They specifically deal with this type of issue,
    struggling with the historical character that stems from the cultural context

    to it, a computer must evolve from a mere imitator to an innovator and maker.
    It should aim to produce something new rather than simply replicate what someone
    else has already invented. I am not claiming that such an algorithm does not exist,
    but we should be cautious about asserting its presence prematurely. I want to
    say that the test is not the ability to reproduce or fake someone else’s painting
    style but rather the ability to make a new cultural shift.

    painting was initially seen as a derogatory deviation from conventional artwork.
    Only after our aesthetic adjustments to the works of the Impressionists like Monet,
    Manet, and Renoir, did we retrospectively appreciate the traces of Impressionism
    that persisted into the 18th century. Suddenly, it pervaded the public domain.
    The evolution of an innovation can be likened to a metaphor; it starts as something
    refreshing and unexpected, and over time, acquires a literal, more defined meaning.
  prefs: []

    and cultural context and the way we interpret the past. It’s an intricate process
    and can’t be depicted by mere software that extracts the rules that Van Gogh used
    to paint. The act of painting is much more than that. Van Gogh’s works were concrete
    acts made by a concrete individual who innovated beyond existing norms.
