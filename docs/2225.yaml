    decide which course to take.

- en: When I was looking for my first online Data Science coding course in 2019, I
    couldn’t get over this feeling of ***analysis paralysis*** and I spent way too
    long trying to decide between different options. Then, when I finally made a decision
    and spent £20 on a course, I soon found that it was the wrong one for me, and
    I didn’t even finish it.

    ([2015](https://oro.open.ac.uk/43566/)) and ResearchGate ([2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330316898_The_MOOC_pivot))
    have estimated that completion rates of online courses can be as low as 3%.

- en: Since my disastrous first attempt in 2019, I’ve taken (and finished!) many other
    courses and have learned important lessons about how to pick the right course
    and maximise its value. In this article, I’ll share some of the best courses I’ve
    taken and share 5 key considerations that I use to help me decide between courses.
    This is the advice I wish I’d heard back in 2019, and, if it’s helpful for you,
    it would mean a lot if you clicked my ‘Follow’ button — only 1% of my readers
    do!
