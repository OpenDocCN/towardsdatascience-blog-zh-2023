    into educational hiccups along the way. These hiccups could be silly mistakes,
    searching all night for a solution to a bug, or simply not knowing about some
    syntax that could greatly benefit your code. As a Data Scientist with most of
    my experience being on the object-oriented or iterative side of programming, this
    was certainly the case whenever I was originally introduced to the Julia language
    about six years ago. However, I have learned overtime and the educational experience
    has taught me a lot of valuable information that I am now happy to hold!

    is that I can pad these same sorts of barriers to entry and clever programming
    by sharing this information! Julia is an amazing programming language, especially
    when it comes to the domain of Data Science! That being said, it is definitely
    worth learning, so today I would like to make your travels go a little bit smoothly
    by demonstrating some of my favorite features that I wish I had a firm hold on
    coming into the language and in my humble beginning with the language.
