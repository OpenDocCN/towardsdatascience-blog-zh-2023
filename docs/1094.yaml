    the risk of losing an amount L (obviously less than W₀) with a probability p in
    the near future, we cannot consider that our wealth is still W₀ (which is obvious
    when p = 1). Instead, we should compute what is called in game theory the “certainty
    equivalent” of our wealth in a risky environment.

- en: 'The certainty equivalent is the amount Wₑ such that the utility of Wₑ is the
    same as the utility of our assets exposed to a loss. If we are risk neutral, the
    utility function to be used is simply the identity and so the certainty equivalent
    is simply our current wealth reduced by the loss expectation (which is rather
    intuitive even without any notion of utility function, when giving it a thought):
    proof is that if the utility of Wₑ (which is Wₑ) is equal to the utility of our
    wealth exposed to a loss (what is called a “lottery” in game theory), it means
    that Wₑ = (1-p) W₀ + p (W₀-L) = W₀ - pL (in game theory the utility of a lottery
    is the expected utility of the lottery outcomes), and so Wₑ= W₀ - pL. If we are
    risk-averse, we can for example use a logarithm as a utility function, and so
    ln(Wₑ) is equal to (1-p) ln(W₀) + p ln(W₀-L), meaning that Wₑ = W₀^(1-p) (W₀-L)^p.'

    p of losing exactly L in the near future (no discounting rate applied), but it
    will be enough to illustrate the concepts. We now have to ask ourselves what is
    the cost of the risk, and this is very straightforward: it is the difference between
    our wealth W₀ before we were exposed to any loss and Wₑ we now have because of
    the risk exposure. For risk-neutral people, the risk cost r = W₀ - Wₑ = W₀ - (W₀
    - pL) = pL which is rather intuitive as it is only the expected loss. For risk-averse
    people (with the logarithm utility function), we get a slightly more complicated
    figure as risk cost, r being equal to W₀-W₀^(1-p) (W₀-L)^p = W₀ [1 - (1 - L/W₀)ᵖ].'

    probability p can be associated with the same risk cost r. We shall draw on a
    chart all these points that represent the same risk cost r, the amount L being
    represented on the y-axis and the probability p on the x-axis. In order to find
    the equation of the curves on which all points are associated with the same risk
    r (which is why these curves are usually called “iso-risk curves”) we only have
    to set r as a constant and deduce the expression of L depending on p. For risk-neutral
    entities, we start from the definition of r=W₀-Wₑ = pL implying that L = r/p.
    For risk-averse entities we do the same starting from r = W₀-Wₑ = W₀ - W₀^(1 -
    p) (W₀ - W)^p and we finally get L=W₀ [1 - (1-r/W₀)^(1/p)] (that is not defined
    for p = 0 but this case is not interesting except to see that there is a discontinuity
    related to the Allais paradox: even if p is extremely small we are supposed to
    care for the risk according to the utility function we chose, but in reality we
    would never consider such a small risk — we shall ignore this as this is unrelated
    to our main concern).'

    risk cost is a bit less than r = 1 (let us assume r = 0.9), if we assume the company
    is risk-averse. However not all firms are risk-averse: insurance companies are
    close to being risk-neutral (putting aside their fees) because they can mutualize
    the risk, leveraging the law of large numbers. For an insurance company, the risk
    cost r will be even more below 1 (let us assume r = 0.8) and so the insurance
    company will be able to propose a deal: the owner of the warehouse will pay a
    premium of 0.85 to transfer the risk to the insurer, thus sparing 0.9 as a risk
    cost. In the end the insurer will be paid 0.85 to bear a cost of 0.8, thus earning
    0.05, while the other firm will pay 0.85 to get rid of the cost of 0.9, thus earning
    0.05 as well.'

    Bernoulli trial, loss probability and loss frequency are the same, which is not
    true in general). In that case risk transfer does not appear to be very interesting,
    as the risk cost for corporates and insurances is pretty much the same. In general
    there is little interest in being covered against little losses very likely to
    occur, if any. Companies can self-insure these locations (through captives) or
    use deductibles in order to reduce the overall premium paid: the insurer will
