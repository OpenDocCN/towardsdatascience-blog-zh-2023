    Madness is just around the corner. If you are new to the college basketball scene,
    March Madness is the name for the NCAA tournament crowning the champion of Division
    I men’s basketball. Whether you are a burgeoning fan or a 50-year veteran spectator,
    data science is playing a larger role than ever before in how you experience the
    game. The teams comprising the tournament are chosen in large part by a data-driven
    algorithm called NET rankings.

    how the field can impact different industries, including sports and entertainment.
    While college basketball is a late adopter of a growing trend, the NET rankings
    are a prime example of how the way we shape our algorithms can influence outcomes
    and incentivize behaviors. If you work in sports analytics, understanding NET
    rankings is an absolute must, but regardless of your industry, the college basketball
    world has laid out an important case study in using data science to improve their
    product and grow their revenue.

    some additional context: March Madness is a 68-team men’s college basketball tournament
    that runs from mid-March to early April every year. The winner of the tournament
    is crowned the National Champion. To start the tournament, there are four play-in
    games called the “First Four”. After these four games, the remaining 64 teams
    are then divided into four regions of 16 teams ranked 1–16\. The champion of each
    region makes it to the semi-finals called the “Final Four”.'

    There is broad interest in the tournament, as it is often an excellent excuse
    to wager money among friends or in Las Vegas. Of the 68 teams that make up the
    field, 31 are conference champions and 37 receive “at-large” bids [3]. The study
    and chatter of how these teams will be organized in the tournament is called “bracketology.”
    Bracketology is more of an art than a science, however. Deciding who receives
    the “at-large” bids is a topic of constant debate. This is where NET rankings
    come into play.

    Evaluation Tool or NET [1]. The ranking system is a collaboration with Google
    Cloud Professional Services aimed at providing a data-driven indicator of the
    quality of a given college basketball team. When the rankings were first released,
    they relied on five different metrics: Team Value Index, Net Efficiency, win percentage,
    adjusted win percentage, and scoring margin [2]. However, since then, the rankings
    have been adjusted to include only Team Value Index and Net Efficiency [1].'

    the quality of teams among sports writers and basketball fans. Regardless of the
    various opinions of NET rankings, it is used as the basis for decision making
    by the NCAA selection committee to determine which teams receive an “at-large”
    bid and how to assign rankings within a region (these rankings are called seeds).
    All of these decisions can affect the outcome of the tournament. Thus, you can
    start to see how data science underlies the bedrock of March Madness.

    is not completely clear. Obviously, they will have access to the NET rankings.
    In addition, they will have access to a report on each team in the form of a NET
    sheet. Each team’s NET sheet is split up into several sections. Across the top
    of the sheet, there is the NET rank, information on the team record, strength
    of schedule, opponent average NET rankings, other result-based and predictive
    rankings, and the win-loss record broken down by opponent quadrant and game location.
    The bottom half of the sheet is a game-by-game breakdown of team performance divided
    into sections by opponent NET ranking/quadrant. I encourage you to look at some
    example NET team sheets such as the one I have below from [[5](https://www.warrennolan.com/basketball/2023/net-teamsheets-plus)].

    a lot of information packed into a tight space. On the team sheets, the Quad 1and
    Quad 2games are further divided into upper and lower halves. Also notice that
    non-conference games are highlighted in blue and delineated in the metrics above.
    Losses are highlighted in red so as to easily point out bad (Quad 4) losses or
    great (Quad 1) wins. As you can tell, the quadrant system plays a key role in

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know there are many basketball fans out there who are critical of the NET
    ranking system. No model is perfect, and NET is no exception. However, I will
    try to highlight some limitations that I see of the NET ranking system from the
    perspective of a data scientist (in conjunction with a college basketball fan).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest limitation I see with the NET ranking system is that does not take
    recency into account [1]. While it’s true that consistency over an entire season
    is valuable and laudable, there is something to be said for peaking at the right
    time in the season. Whether it is conditioning, chemistry, or confidence, everything
    needs to align perfectly to have success during March Madness. In basketball speak,
    these are the “intangibles”. They are not easily measured ([although some have
    tried](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/nba_intangibles)), but they are
    changing over time and do affect outcomes. In econometrician speak, this is the
    “[heterogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneity_in_economics)” inherent
    to the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another curiosity of the NET rankings that I will categorize as a limitation
    is the delay in their initial release. The NET rankings are updated daily but
    not until early December — after most teams have played between 5 and 10 games.
    I think this likely signifies that there is a highly uncertain initialization
    state for the NET rankings. It would be interesting to know whether each team
    begins the season in a specific ranking or quadrant based on historical data,
    subjective intuition, or a random distribution. If we were able to see the initial
    state of the NET rankings before the first tip-off of the season, I think we could
    gain some very valuable insight into how the algorithm works. Is it completely
    naive or is there an element of [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning)
    from seasons prior or other polls’ preseason rankings?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To tabulate a final NET ranking, I assume that there is some manner in which
    Team Value Index is converted to a numerical value and it is combined with Net
    Efficiency to calculate a weighted metric of team quality. I will admit that NET
    rankings could very well be a heuristic or other non-AI algorithm. Certainly,
    the manner in which the Net Efficiency statistic is calculated would suggest that
    the NCAA would be open to a heuristic-type approach. Moreover, my experience with
    providing data science insight into a non-technical realm, such as health policy,
    has shown me that sometimes less is more. More understandable models can sometimes
    be more attractive to decision makers.

    is a supervised learning algorithm. If NET rankings are derivative of a supervised
    learning algorithm, then I wonder where the training data might come from. What
    would be the baseline truth? How is accuracy measured? What truly distinguishes
    team #232 from team #233? Even when comparing the same team to itself year over
    year, you could be comparing wildly different rosters. It would be hard to find
    meaning in an error metric like root mean squared error.'

    the [RPI ranking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_percentage_index),
    was an elegant but simple heuristic algorithm. Institutions like the NCAA are
    not necessarily known for innovation, and I doubt the college basketball community
    wants to feel that its crown jewel tournament is driven by non-interpretable AI
    algorithm. So, my best guess is that there is limited, if any, machine learning
    at play. Harkening back to the third limitation I mentioned earlier, a supervised
    learning approach is probably more trouble than it is worth.

    The NET ranking of a team is dependent on the NET rankings of its opponents which
    are dependent on the NET rankings of its opponents, and so on and so forth. NET
    rankings could be driven by a [Bayesian approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
    whereby there is an initial naive distribution assumed for each team, and after
    each game, that distribution is updated.

    of cognitive bias or clever marketing, but I want to believe that whatever Google
    touches uses cutting-edge methodology. While not necessarily true, partnering
    with Google gives the NCAA access to massive computational resources and ability
    to develop methods beyond the traditional sports analytics' realm. Even if the
    algorithm is interpretable, perhaps the structure is complex and potentially even
    counterintuitve.

    the web, it was hard to find any sources that publish the NET rankings each day.
    This makes me skeptical enough to directly contradict my supposition in point
    3\. Perhaps, the algorithm is simple enough, that it could be easily re-engineered
    with access to a season’s worth of data and NET rankings. Perhaps, we could fit
    a simple linear regression to produce a score value for each team and the NET
    rankings are a sorted list of the resulting scores.

- en: Given that there are many possible underlying methods to producing the ultimate
    NET rankings, I believe the most likely scenario is that the NCAA is using [ensemble
    learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning), such as voting. This
    means that they could be taking multiple approaches to producing a NET ranking
    as a function of Team Value Index and Net Efficiency. Then, they combine the results
    of these methods to develop a final NET ranking that gets published each week.

    the NET ranking, my opinion is that the results are not the most important outcome
    of NET ranking. Of course, the NCAA wants to identify the best teams to make March
    Madness as competitive and meritorious as possible. So, the rankings need to appear
    to be reasonable and likely will align closely with the AP and Coaches Polls.

    basketball that no other ranking system explicitly does: **NET rankings incentivize
    high quality non-conference games**.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This point cannot be understated. This is the other side of the power of data.
    By publishing the components of the NET rankings, the NCAA is proclaiming very
    publicly the metrics to which all teams ought to perform. From a business strategy
    perspective, the Team Value Index is genius. Like the Net Efficiency metric, it
    strives to quantify the quality of a college basketball team in an understandable
    way. Unlike the Net Efficiency metric, however, Team Value Index pushes athletic
    directors, coaches, and all parties involved in scheduling to ensure that the
    non-conference slate of games is flush with Quad 1 games. Compared to the conference
    schedule, non-conference schedules are flexible and versatile. While the importance
    of non-conference competition has been increasing even before the NET rankings
    debuted, the Team Value Index and emphasis on the quadrant system in NET rankings
    formalizes this importance and rewards teams with tougher schedules.

    important, content is king. The greater number of high quality (Quad 1) games
    that NCAA basketball can produce during the season, the greater the value of the
    media content that is college basketball. As more streaming services dip their
    toes into college athletics, improved in-season games means more fans for the
    sport. More fans mean more intrigue in during both the regular season and post-season.
    More intrigue means more revenue all season long and much more revenue for the
    already lucrative March Madness.

    play, please refer back to the image of the NET team sheet. The non-conference
    strength of schedule and records get their own lines at the top while the non-conference
    games are highlighted in bright cyan. I cannot guarantee that this is the version
    of the team sheet that the selection committee sees, but it nonetheless supports
    my claim.

    brings those components together into one coherent ranking is shrouded in secrecy.
    There are many possible methods and models that could be used to produce the NET
    rankings, but whatever the method is, it is backed by data.

    committee on how to structure the tournament while they explicitly incentivize
    the teams to improve their non-conference strength of schedule. Overall, I think
    the NET rankings are good for the sport of basketball and the tournament. They
    can help reduce bias in selecting and seeding teams during March Madness and improve
    the quality of the sport during the regular season. So, whether you have never
    missed a First Four or never heard of the Final Four, now you know how data science
    is behind it all.
