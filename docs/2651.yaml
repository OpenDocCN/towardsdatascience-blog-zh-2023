    Taking it a step further; narrative visualization allows us to craft data stories
    that transform information into a series of compelling scenes. This approach tailors

    the data. It represents data in an innovative way creating a story through it.
    This story emphasizes the critical points to increase interactivity and enables
    the audience to relate to the charts. Each visual element should be carefully
    woven together into a meaningful story. Thus, this data informs the audience while
    actively resonating with their senses. This passive data encounter allows the
    audience to retain important information for a period of time.

    your audience on a journey to discover the data. The data is briefly introduced
    in the beginning; it is profoundly explored in the middle and concludes with shedding
    light on the key insights or providing flexible exploration tools, thus forming
    an interactive story.

    story instead of randomly presenting facts and figures. Therefore, the data becomes
    the characters in a story, and your job as the narrator is to bring these characters
    to life using visuals. The audience engages with the data story while drawing
    connections and recognizing patterns that can easily be retained in the long run.
