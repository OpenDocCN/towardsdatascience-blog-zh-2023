    if you’re one of those four lucky individuals, you’re probably meditating blissfully

    tension of balancing competing needs. A few hours can make the difference between
    shipping a machine learning project on time and missing a deadline. They can determine
    whether you get to spend an afternoon with friends, bake a cheesecake from scratch,
    rewatch the *Succession* finale, or… not do any of those things.

    you can find them on your own. Instead, what we offer you this week are pragmatic,
    hands-on approaches for speeding up workflows that data professionals execute
    every day. From choosing the right tools to streamlining your data-cleaning process,
    you stand to gain some precious minutes by learning from our authors, so we hope
    you use them well—or not! It’s *your* time.

    [Markus Hubrich](https://medium.com/u/3b63a2f93113?source=post_page-----607a28468643--------------------------------)
    highlights R-trees’ power to [**dramatically improve the speed of spatial searches**](/speed-up-your-geospatial-data-analysis-with-r-trees-4f75abdc6025),
    and uses the (delightful) example of tree-mapping to illustrate his point.

    we suspect, many of you as well—data cleaning can get tedious, fast. To breeze
    through this stage of your project, Vicky recommends creating user-defined functions
    (UDFs), which make it possible to [**simplify your SQL queries and avoid having
    to code the same logic**](/simplify-data-cleaning-with-bigquery-sql-user-defined-functions-41c0560ea6)
