    when used for displaying counts, totals or proportions. However, using them in
    the wrong way can lead to unintentional (or even worse, intentional) data misinterpretation.
    The particular issue I will be talking about today is using bar charts to present
    aggregated summary statistics such as means or medians.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest problem here is the loss of detail as bar charts can oversimplify,
    leaving out important information such as variance, distribution, outliers, and
    trends. In this post I will illustrate this problem using a series of examples
    and propose potential solutions. In order to not interfere with the flow of the
    post, the code for the charts will be specified at the end for those who are interested
    :)

- en: For this post, I will be using the wine quality dataset¹, available through
    the [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
    Although the dataset contains many wine properties, we will focus on the total
    sulfur dioxide measurements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sulfur, commonly added to wine as sulfur dioxide, plays a crucial role in winemaking
    due to its preservative qualities. Acting as an antioxidant, it helps prevent
    the wine’s oxidation, safeguarding it from discoloration and undesired flavor
    alterations. Its antimicrobial characteristics also protect the wine against spoilage
    from bacteria and yeasts, preserving the intended taste and quality.

    dioxide levels between red and white wines.

    the basic chart looks so ugly, it is off-putting without any further argument
    needed. Let’s first make it a bit prettier by tweaking some aesthetic properties.

- en: Much better. Now, back to the issue a hand. What does the chart tell us? Well,
    obviously, the sulfur levels seem to be much higher for white wines. This was
    to be expected due to the differences in the winemaking process between red and
    white wines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Red wines are fermented with their skins, providing natural antioxidants that
    help protect the wine from oxidation. In contrast, white wines are typically made
    by pressing the grapes and removing the skins prior to fermentation. This leaves
    them more susceptible to oxidation, requiring additional protection in the form
    of sulfur dioxide.

- en: Although the average effect is discernible, the bar chart gives us no information
    about the distribution of values in each group, or the number of observations
    per each group.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can partially be addressed by adding the number of observations above the
    bars and adding errorbars to show the standard deviations of each group.

- en: This can be enough if the underlying distribution of values is symmetrical,
    but that doesn’t have to be the case, making standard deviation a poor choice
    as a dispersion statistic. Nothing more can be added to bar charts to fix this
    without making it closer to a completely different type of chart. This indicates
    that bar charts are not ideal for presenting this type of data.

    solution.

    small. However, in this specific case, it feels quite cumbersome by itself due
    to a very large number of wines in the dataset.

- en: 2\. Boxplots with specified means
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second alternative is using boxplots with an added twist of specifying the
    means as well as medians (which are displayed by a flat line in the central box
    by default). Although boxplots give us an idea of the underlying distribution
    by specifying quartiles, I like the additional information which the mean offers.
    This is because a large and easily visible difference between the mean and the
    median immediately tells us whether the distribution is skewed and in which direction.

- en: 3\. Violin plots with medians
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Violin plots are great because they let us in on the shape of the underlying
    distributions, making it possible to easily detect anomalies such as bimodalities
    or data skewness. One might argue that boxplots do this implicitly as well. Although
    I agree to a certain point, we also have to take into account that a person has
    to be taught how to read a boxplot, whereas that’s not the case with violin plots.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also like to add the information on the median since the violins leave a lot
    of unused space, so why not :)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ok, this one isn’t really a standalone option, but rather a combination of options
    1 and 3\. For our specific case, this would be my pick, but that doesn’t mean
    it would be ideal for all possible scenarios, as that depends on specifics of
    the problem such as the number of groups for comparison, total number of points,
    group dispersions, …
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice that I didn’t try to combine boxplots with specific points. This is intentional,
    as I feel that such a combination would defeat the purpose of the boxplot. Namely,
    the boxplot charts display specific points only if they are 1.5 interquartile
    ranges above the upper border of the central box. This can be used as a simple
    method for outlier detection, and would be obscured by adding too many other points
    as well.
