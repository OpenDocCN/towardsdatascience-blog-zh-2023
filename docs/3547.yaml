    day to day work, and learn to cope with it. But by and large, data scientists
    and machine learning model developers are unfamiliar with thinking about the outcomes
    of models with these kinds of stakes. When modeling, in the example of a classification
    model, a substantial part of the task is to estimate the cost of what we call
    False Positives and False Negatives — essentially, what bad thing will happen
    when we predict an event that does not actually occur (FP) or we predict that
    no event will occur but it actually does (FN). In other kinds of models, we also
    spend time considering the cost of a model making a prediction that is wildly
    different from the desired value or what really occurs. The common thread is that
    models ALWAYS have some amount of unavoidable error, even generative AI. As I’ve
    talked about many times in the past, model outputs are based in some way or another
    on probabilities, and these leave open some room for error (undesirable behavior)
    to result.

    of error, mean in a healthcare setting? If it wasn’t already obvious, money is
    only a small part of the potential error from models, in healthcare or even in
    other industries. Money loss should be a low priority when compared with “loss
    of life” or “loss of ability to live independently”. While our legal system attempts
    to assign monetary values to these things, for court cases where damages are allotted,
    it’s really not the same thing, especially when it’s YOUR life or quality of life
    in question.
