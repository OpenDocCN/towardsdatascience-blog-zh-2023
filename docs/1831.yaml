    number of fields, but with this increased use comes increased risks and ethical
    tests that models need to pass.

    a tree while in self-driving mode](https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/woman-recovering-after-tesla-crashes-in-self-driving-mode).
    According to authorities, the driver said the vehicle pulled to the right, went
    off the road, and hit a tree once she put it into self-driving mode. Currently,
    these claims are under investigation, but imagine how difficult it would be to
    identify the reasoning behind the car’s sudden erratic decisions. Did it misclassify?
    What did it see that confused it? With traditional black-box models, investigations
    into the model internals are difficult and costly.

    Yes, through prototype learning [2] and neural prototype trees [1]! With these
    architectures, the model takes a very intuitive approach to prediction: identifying
    pieces that look familiar. Does the bird have a long beak? Does it have a red
    throat? It must be a hummingbird!'
