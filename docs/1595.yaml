    Start by creating a startup-like atmosphere that energizes your team around a

    and iteratively.** It doesn’t have to be highly structured; instead, it should
    be a flexible process that you can adjust based on the project type. For example,
    I’m a big fan of combining Agile with Waterfall (WaterScrumFall). You plan your
    activities on a high level (goals, milestones, releases, success criteria etc.)
    but iterate in weekly sprints during execution to respond to changing situations
    and pivot quickly if necessary.

    in place, various constraints, and your preferences or habits. But be flexible;
    each team and project is unique. For example, a seasoned team working on an R&D
    project from the office might find Kanban helpful while ditching daily standups.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s true that uncertainty in ML projects is high, **but only planning can help
    you understand it, plan for various scenarios, and control it**. Before starting
    any ML project, iteration, or activity, dedicate some time for planning. I know
    that especially in the early stages, it’s extremely difficult since it may be
    unclear what will work. But planning is an exercise that will help you control
    the unknown, prepare for various scenarios, and mitigate risks.

    should. Create a list of potential risks and a mitigation plan that you update
    regularly with your team. Over time, you’ll see that managing uncertainty can
    become more manageable.

    allow you to track your progress. For monitoring purposes, you can assign them
    to phases and milestones. They may reflect tangible aspects, such as the performance
    of your model, latency, or the UX use cases covered. But they can also be intangible,
    such as user satisfaction, which may be more important than tangible metrics in
    some cases.

    ML activity. Keeping your stakeholders informed about your progress, risks, and
    problems is crucial. Weekly or bi-weekly meetings work best (even if they’re short).
    Educating them about ML in plain language will help you a lot.

    milestones or even getting the model to converge. It boosts morale, enhances teamwork,
    and keeps the team creative. it’s important to recognize your team’s hard work
    and keep everyone motivated. You can celebrate in any way you like — maybe grab
    some coffee, buy a cake or have a team dinner. And even just sending a message
    on chat or email can make a difference!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about reflection? It is also a crucial activity that you should do with
    your team in the form of **retrospective meetings or lessons learned**. It is
    not about blaming anybody, but rather it should allow team members to step back
    as a unit and evaluate what went well and what could have been done differently
    in order to be more effective in relation to research, development, collaboration,
    communication, management, and other relevant aspects.
