- en: Large amounts of data are acquired daily from wells around the world. However,
    the quality of that data can vary significantly from missing data to data impacted
    by sensor failure and borehole conditions. This can have knock-on consequences
    on other parts of a subsurface project, such as delays and inaccurate assumptions
    and conclusions.

- en: As missing data is one of the most common issues we face with well log data
    quality, numerous methods and techniques have been developed to estimate values
    and fill in the gaps. This includes the application of machine learning technology
    — which has increased in popularity over the past few decades with libraries such
    as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- en: In this tutorial, we will be using Keras, which is a high-level neural networks
    API that runs on top of TensorFlow. We will use it to illustrate the process of
    building a machine-learning model to allow predictions of bulk density (RHOB).
    This is a commonly acquired logging measurement, however, it can be significantly
    impacted by bad hole conditions or, in some cases, tools can fail, resulting in
    no measurements…
