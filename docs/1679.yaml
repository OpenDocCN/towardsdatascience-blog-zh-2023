- en: In detective shows, the [use of a corkboard containing relevant evidence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringTheory)
    that is connected by red strings is often depicted as a method for investigators
    to visualize and track connections between individuals and events in an investigation.
    The red string is used to physically connect different nodes (often represented
    by photographs or notes) on a board or wall, showing the relationships between
    them.

    (no, not that [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory)) and
    there are some that refer to the emergent object itself as a [“crazy wall”](https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/film/news/a7703/detective-show-crazy-walls/)
    or a [“string board”](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/02/fbi-crazy-stringboard-recruiting-campaign.html).
    In the field of network theory, this technique of analyzing the links and connections
    between people, organizations, or documents, is known as [link analysis](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/insights/latest/analyze/link-analysis.htm)
    and it has been used for over a century in law enforcement, fraud detection, sociological
    research, and a variety of other contexts.
