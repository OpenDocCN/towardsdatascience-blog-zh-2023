- en: The importance of interpretability in machine learning models is growing as
    they are increasingly applied in real‐world scenarios. Understanding how models
    make decisions benefits not only the model's users but also those who are affected
    by the decisions made by the model. **Counterfactual explanations** have been
    developed to cope with this issue, as they allow individuals to understand how
    they would achieve a desirable outcome by perturbing their original data. In the
    short term, counterfactual explanation possibly demonstrates actionable suggestions
    to those who are affected by a machine learning model decision. For example, a
    person who was rejected for a loan application could know what could have done
    to be accepted this time and that would be useful to improve on their next application.

    counterfactual explanations to the original data for all the instances in tree‐based
    machine learning models.

- en: CFXplorer is a Python package that generates counterfactual explanations for
    a given model and data by using the FOCUS algorithm. This article introduces and
    showcases how CFXplorer can be used for generating counterfactual explanations.
