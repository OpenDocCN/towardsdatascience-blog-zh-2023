    former is slow and painful, while the latter is (relatively) quick and easy. This
    is why having mentors can help accelerate progress toward your goals.

    too niche. I was (and still am) interested in the intersection of data science
    and entrepreneurship. While I found many data scientists and entrepreneurs out
    there, it was difficult to connect with those that identify with both categories.

    point when I decided to transition my search **off of LinkedIn and onto Upwork**.
