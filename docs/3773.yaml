    team every chance he gets. Over the last few years, his team won more *regular-season*

    back to his school’s glory years. There’s just one problem; back in the 1950s
    and 60s, teams played only *10* regular season games.

    school (such as Alabama, Ohio State, or Oklahoma) adds a random team to their

    most other teams.

    the *full roster* of teams — win this extra game about half the time. This would
    result in an *average* improvement to their record of *0.5* games per season,
    all things being equal. Thus, there will be years when they have the *opportunity*
    of winning at least *one game more* than they have historically.

    the occasional 9 or 10-win season now when they never achieved more than 7 or
    8-win seasons in the past may not be that impressive. Teams today play more games
    than in the past, and at least one of them is probably a weaker opponent by design.
