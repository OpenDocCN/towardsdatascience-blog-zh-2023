    team every chance he gets. Over the last few years, his team won more *regular-season*
    games (by *one* game) than ever before. Now he’s crowing about it, comparing (way)
    back to his school’s glory years. There’s just one problem; back in the 1950s
    and 60s, teams played only *10* regular season games.

    10 out of 12 today yields only 83%. So, winning 10 games is not as great as it

    to 12 games. To smooth out the effects of coaching changes and constantly evolving
    rules and regulations, we’ll use my friend’s alma mater and five other schools
    with similar football traditions, throughout 34 seasons straddling 2006.

    school (such as Alabama, Ohio State, or Oklahoma) adds a random team to their
    schedule, they will probably *win* this extra game, as they are *stronger* than
    most other teams.
  prefs: []

    to *lose* this extra game, as most other teams are *better* than they are.
  prefs: []

- en: Theoretically, teams in the middle would — assuming they drew randomly from
    the *full roster* of teams — win this extra game about half the time. This would
    result in an *average* improvement to their record of *0.5* games per season,
    all things being equal. Thus, there will be years when they have the *opportunity*
    of winning at least *one game more* than they have historically.

    are a few tough non-conference opponents (South Carolina has a traditional rivalry
    with Clemson, for example), the average ranking of the six SEC teams was almost
    twice that of their opponents. Some of these opponents were even from the lower-level
    *Football Championship Subdivision (FCS)*.

    winnable game every year since 2006? Perhaps. But the fact that they win, on average,

    the occasional 9 or 10-win season now when they never achieved more than 7 or
    8-win seasons in the past may not be that impressive. Teams today play more games
    than in the past, and at least one of them is probably a weaker opponent by design.
