- en: The NBA stands out as one of the most **lucrative** and **competitive** leagues
    in sports. In the last few years, the salaries of NBA players have been on an
    **ascending** trend, but behind every awe-inspiring dunk and three-pointer lies
    a complex web of factors that determine these salaries.

    numerous variables come into play. Who never pondered why their team spent so
    much on an underperforming player, or marveled at a successful deal?

- en: Before diving into the problem, it is essential to grasp the fundamentals of
    the league’s salary system. When a player is available on the market to sign a
    contract with any team he is known as a **free agent** (FA), a term that will
    be used a lot in this project.

- en: 'The NBA operates under a complex set of rules and regulations that aim to maintain
    competitive balance among teams. Two key concepts are at the core of this system:
    the **salary cap** and the **luxury tax**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **salary cap** serves as a spending limit, restricting how much a team can
    spend on player salaries in a given season. The cap is determined by the league’s
    revenue, and it is updated every year to ensure that teams operate within a reasonable
    financial framework. It also intends to prevent large-market teams from significantly
    outspending smaller-market counterparts, promoting parity among franchises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The distribution of the salary cap among players can vary, with maximum salaries
    for top-tier players and minimum salaries for rookies and veterans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, **exceeding the salary cap is not uncommon**, especially for teams
    aiming to construct championship-contending rosters. When a team surpasses the
    salary cap, it enters into the realm of the **luxury tax**. The luxury tax imposes
    a penalty on teams that spend above a certain threshold, discouraging teams from
    excessive spending while also providing additional revenue for the league.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many other rules that act as exceptions, like the **mid-level exception**
    **(MLE)** and **trade exception** that allows teams to make strategic roster moves,
    but for this project the knowledge of the salary cap and luxury tax is enough.

    will be using the **percentage of the cap as the target instead of the salary
    amount itself**. This decision aims to incorporate the cap’s evolving nature,
    ensuring that the outcome remains unaffected by temporal shifts and remains applicable
    even when evaluating historical seasons. However, it should be noted that this

    of the models. Initially, I selected all available players, however most of them
    would be already under a contract, and in this case the value of the salary does
    not change drastically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, imagine if a player signs for $20M for 4 years. He receives approximately
    $5M per year (very rarely all years are the same exact value, usually there is
    a certain progression in the salary around $5M). However, when a free agent signs
    a new contract, the value may change much more drastically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that training **a model with all available players may result into
    a better performance** **overall** (after all, most players would have a salary
    very close to the last!), but when evaluating **only free agents, the performance
    would be significantly worse**.
  prefs: []

    Beasley** are also in a similar situation, earning very small contracts with good

    the target to the selection of players, this project proved to be more complex
    than expected. However, the outcome proved to be quite simple and the results
    obtained were very satisfying!
  prefs: []

    use of feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the
    feature space and thus the variance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, having access to the free agents of previous seasons would also make
    possible to increase the number of samples. However, such data doesn’t seem to
    be publicly accessible at the moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of other external variables also have influence in this matter. For instance,
    there is no question that if somehow theteam was known, variables like **last
    year seed**, **playoff outcome** and **percentage of cap already used** could
    be really informative. However, maintaining the approach that mirrors the circumstances
    of an actual free agent scenario where the team is unknown may potentially yield
    a result that aligns more closely with the player’s **“real value”**, regardless
    of the signing team’s context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main premises of this project was the use of only data from the previous
    season to predict the next salary. Incorporating statistics from older seasons
    could indeed yield improved results, given that a player’s historical performance
    can offer valuable insights. However, the expansive nature of such data would
    necessitate thoughtful feature selection to manage the complexity and high dimensionality.
