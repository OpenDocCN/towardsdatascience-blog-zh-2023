    published in the journal Nature, Scientific Reports: [*Improving MGMT methylation
    status prediction of glioblastoma through optimizing radiomics features using
    genetic algorithm-based machine learning approach*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17707-w).
    The goal of this study was to try to predict O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferae
    (MGMT) methylation status. The reason why it is important to be able to predict
    this status is because it can be a good indicator of how effective the chemotherapy
    treatment Temozolomide (TMZ) will be.'

    ultimately leads to cell death. TMZ also makes the cells more sensitive to radiation.
    This is a big factor in cancer treatment as radiation is used to help kill cancer
    cells.

    status through machine learning. If successful, this can help alleviate some of
    the technical limitations and invasive procedures that are currently in place
    to obtain the tumor specimens needed to test for the status.

    effectively due to the deadliness they pose to the patients who develop them.
    With a median survival of 14–16 months, they account for about 45% of all malignant
    central nervous system tumors.

    MGMT methylation status. First by eliminating noisy radiomics features and next
    by implementing classification algorithms into a genetic algorithm to help identify
    the best prediction features.
  prefs: []

- en: There were various machine-learning techniques that were tested during this
    research. The purpose was to find the most meaningful radiomics features for prediction.
    They did this by extracting radiomics features from multimodal images from magnetic
    resonance images (MRI). The two-stage feature selection method started with an
    eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model followed by a genetic algorithm (GA)-based
    wrapper model. GA models work in a similar fashion to natural selection, where
    the ‘fittest’ set of features for predictions are identified.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data that was used were preprocessed and segmented multimodal MRI features
    from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In total, there were 53 GBM patients that were included
    and 704 radiomics features were obtained.

    generation of the initial population, fitness assessment, selection of parents,
    crossover, mutation, and population replacement for the next generation. The formula
    that was used for selection probability (where the features are selected based
    on their performance in the fitness assessment stage) is shown below:'

- en: Once the initial features were extracted from the XGBoost algorithm it was time
    to do classification using the features to predict which patients fell into the
    classes on MGMT Methylated and Unmethylated and used that as the fitness assessment.
    They tried implementing three different machine learning algorithms into the fitness
    assessment piece of the genetic algorithm workflow. They used Random Forest (RF),
    XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). To implement the algorithms, they
    utilized the Python machine learning library SKlearn.

    model performance with three different measurements: accuracy, specificity, and
    recall. To compare the performance, they used the mean of running cross-validation
    20 times and used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for evaluation.'

    the Genetic Algorithm (GA-RF). This technique outperformed the others in all of
    the evaluation metrics with an accuracy of 0.925, a sensitivity of 0.894, and
    a specificity of 0.966.

- en: After the GA-RF model finished there was an optimal subset of 22 radiomics features.
    Amongst these features included 17 textural features, 3 histogram-based features,
    1 volume feature, and 1 intensity feature. Textural features can play a helping
    role for clinicians by reflecting spatial intensity correlations and distributions
    of voxels that could help quantify the “multiregional variations” in blood flow,
    edema, and necrosis. Histogram features can be used to illustrate the frequency
    distribution of intensity values that occur in an image.

    features on a new dataset. The dataset they used this time was for patients with
    Low-Grade Gliomas (LGG). They applied the learned features directly and didn’t
    do any additional feature selections.

    a sensitivity of 0.78, and a specificity of 0.62\. Without any transfer learning
    or fine-tuning done, these are promising results.

    the researchers were able to show that these features could potentially be reused

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A potential limitation of this technique is that with a small number of patients,
    researchers may experience a high-dimensionality-related problem. This occurs
    when the number of features is high compared to the amount of training data that
    is available. If this happens it can be challenging to learn accurate relationships
    between the data and the target variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High-dimensionality problems are a widespread issue within the space of radiomics,
    not just in this study. To overcome this limitation the team used cross-validation
    to be more certain of the results they were receiving.

    testing into different groups for each iteration of the validation. By doing this
    multiple times and taking the mean of the results you have more confidence that
    your model can repeatedly obtain the results it is giving.

    be a way for doctors to noninvasively understand the MGMT methylation status of
    their patients. This information can help them to make a more informed treatment
    decision that could help lead to better prognoses within patients. This also opens
    the door for other potential ways radiomics can be utilized in Oncology.
