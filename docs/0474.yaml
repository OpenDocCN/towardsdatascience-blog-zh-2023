  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When sharing our Personally Identifiable Information (PII) it’s only natural
    to want to keep it private. Privacy is all about having control over what information
    is shared, who it’s shared with, and why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personal information includes things like our names, Social Security Numbers,
    emails, mailing addresses, and IP addresses. It’s important to keep this kind
    of data under wraps to protect ourselves from intrusions that range from inconveniences
    (like spam advertisements) to real threats (like identity theft).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most widely recognized Privacy rule in GDPR and CCPA is known as **purpose
    limitation**. According to this rule, you should process PII for specified, explicit,
    and legitimate purposes. You must communicate these purposes to the data subject
    before collecting the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    delivery. Under the purpose limitation principle, you can only use this data for
    product delivery. You have no right to use it for another purpose, such as a marketing
    campaign.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to sharing data, how can we make sure it’s only being used for
    its intended purpose? When the data is made accessible to a wider audience, it
    can be difficult to keep track of how it is is being used. Oftentimes, stakeholders
    are unaware of the specific reason why the data was collected. Without this knowledge,
    it can be hard to follow the rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, data sharing increases the number of potential points of exposure
    for PII data. This opens the door to potential Privacy violations, such as identity
    theft, and loss of control over personal information. The more you open access
    to data, the more opportunities there are for stakeholders to use it for nefarious
    purposes.

    into the overall corporate policy. A comprehensive policy serves as a dependable
    source of information on in-house procedures and standards, including cybersecurity.
    It is an effective way to educate new employees on what they can and cannot do
    with corporate data.
  prefs: []

    a crucial step in ensuring that it is handled in an ethical and legal way.
  prefs: []

    planned. These agreements are used all the time in research, business, and government.
    They’re a great way to make sure everyone’s playing by the rules and using data
    for its intended purpose.

  prefs: []

    potential threats, such as hacking or malware. The more people who have access
    to the data, the more opportunities there are for unauthorized parties to access
    it. Plus, when data is shared, it may also be stored in multiple locations, making
    it more difficult to keep an eye on.

    a Security risk. This is because while a robust IT system may be able to withstand
    external threats, it may not be able to prevent internal threats, such as insider
    breaches.

    the more potential weak spots there are in your company’s systems. But, it doesn’t
    have to be all doom and gloom. Even with more eyes on the data, it’s still possible
    to keep it safe and sound while staying regulation compliant. It’s just a matter

    access and security. On one hand, you want to make sure that the right people
    have access to the information they need to do their jobs, but on the other hand,
    you don’t want to leave the door wide open for just anyone to come strolling in.
    That’s where **access controls** and **data minimization** come in.

    is another key part of the puzzle. It’s all about keeping the amount of data shared
    to a minimum. Instead of sharing everything you’ve got, take a step back and think
    about what information is truly essential for various teams to perform their job.
    In general, you can remove or mask PII columns in datasets without stakeholders
    suffering from it. By sharing only the data that is essential, you can keep the
    amount of PII information that’s floating around to a minimum.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    share data with more people while still keeping it secure and compliant with Security
    regulations. Together they can keep your data safe and sound while still making
    it available to the people who need it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to put this into practice is by using a **data-sharing platform**.
    Think of it like a virtual “filing cabinet” where you can store and share your
    data with the right people. These platforms often come with built-in access controls,
    so you can be sure that only the people who are supposed to have access to the
    data can see it. Plus, they often have robust Security measures in place to keep
    your data safe from falling into the wrong hands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using a data-sharing platform to manage access controls and data minimization,
    you can share your data with more people while still keeping it secure and compliant
    with Security regulations. It’s like a combination lock that keeps your data safe

    situation for everyone.
