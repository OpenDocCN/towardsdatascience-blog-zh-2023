    you’re required to query data for your analysis. Quite often, data is obtained
    from a SQL database and then imported through a programming language like Python
    using powerful frameworks such as Pandas or NumPy. This is a perfectly fine pipeline
    to work with data, however, the heavy lifting is mainly done by your local machine.
    With small datasets, this is not an issue, but when it comes to larger datasets,
    one might encounter issues achieving the heavy processing solely in the PC’s local
    memory.

    machine sensor data. This data is often collected frequently and might also be
    quite noisy. To better understand what’s going on with your machine, smoothing,
    and pre-processing the densely collected data (e.g. measurements could be collected
    several times per second) quickly results in immense dataset sizes! Let’s assume
    we have 150 sensors placed alongside a…
