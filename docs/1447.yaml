- en: One of the most intriguing phenomena within the natural sciences is phase transition
    or critical phenomena, which can usually be seen in the transition between states
    of matter such as solid, liquid and gas. However, it is a phenomenon that transcends
    the usual and connects the brain, a sheet of ferromagnetic material and population
    dynamics, among others [2,3]. However, those emergent patterns of phase transitions
    are not always easily detectable. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques
    can be employed to help with this task. In this article, I'll use as a toy model,
    for the phase transition recognition with Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
    one of the simplest models for critical phenomena analysis, a.k.a the 2D Ising
    model. It was introduced in 1920 by Wilhelm Lenz to describe ferromagnetic materials
    in a simplified way.

    Landau in the 1930s, where he introduced the concept of an order parameter **φ**,
    which can be a scalar, a vector, or even a tensor. The order parameter provides
    information about the phases of the system and the transition between them. It
    is possible to define the order of phase transition as:'

    and consists of a grid of spins that are described by a discrete variable that
    takes just two values ***σᵢ = -1, 1***, i.e., spin *“up”* and spin *“down”.* The
    interaction between these spins is given by the function called Hamiltonian which
    is controlled by the temperature ***T*** of the system, but I won't go into more
    details. This system is famous for going through a ***second-order phase transition,***
    in a ***critical******temperature******Tc,*** with a very simple description.

    are all approximately randomly distributed. The model at the critical point, i.e.
    the phase transition, presents very interesting space-time patterns called emergent
    patterns, with several implications and are studied in various areas.

    by Onsager in 1944\. The solution is simple **φ = ∑ᵢ σᵢ** ( it's just the sum
    of every spin value in the lattice) and will be captured by the unsupervised learning
    without any input besides the system state, i.e. the matrix containing all the
    spin values [1]. For the 2D Ising model, PCA can be performed and even lead to
    the identification of the order parameter.

- en: Phase transitions or order parameters are not always easily found, so certain
    unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques can help find phase
    transitions and critical points. One advantage of these techniques is that none
    assume the presence or locality of the critical point. A simple and common technique
    for dimensionality reduction is **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, which
    is widely used in various physical systems to help with this problem.
  prefs: []

- en: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique through principal components, which
    are mutually orthogonal directions along which the data variances grow monotonically
    as one approaches the first components. PCA finds the principal components through
    a simple linear transformation of the original coordinates ***Y = XW***. The orthogonal
    transformation is made on column vectors ***W = (w₁,w₂,…,wₙ)*** and denotes ***wₗ***
    as weights of principal components in configuration space. They are determined
    by an eigenvector and eigenvalue problem [1].

    each system state is located, PCA finds the most significant linear variations
    in data. Thus, the method will make a linear combination of the base vectors that
    form each system state so that the variance grows monotonically. Hence, it’s possible
    in many cases to observe phase transitions if they exist.

    ranging from ***T/J = 1.6*** to ***2.9***, assuming the existence of the critical
    temperature within this range, and joining each simulation into an ***M*x*N***
    matrix, where ***M=900*** is the total number of configurations and ***N*** is
    the number of spins on the lattice. Thus, all elements of the first row of the
    matrix, *(****S₁ⱼ****)*, will be a spin ***σᵢ = -1,1*** of the lattice of simulation
    1 at temperature ***T = 1.6***, and in the second row of the matrix, (***S₂ⱼ***),
    will be a spin ***σᵢ = -1,1*** of the lattice of simulation *2* at temperature
    ***T = 1.62***.

    temperatures is evident, with well-characterized clusters for the supercritical
    ***T > Tc*** and subcritical ***T < Tc*** cases, while configurations near the
    phase transition are dispersed. At this point, it's possible for other supervised
    algorithms to separate those clusters. It's important to remark that using other
    components will not make a significant contribution, as the vast majority of the
    variance in the simulation data is found in the first two components.

- en: The use of unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction methods can detect
    the critical behavior of the model without even assuming the location and existence
    of the phase transition, or even input information besides the system states data.
    This proves to be quite useful in more complex models that do not have an analytical
    solution, with complicated phase transitions and emergent phenomena.
