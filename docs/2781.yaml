    applications, the challenge of ensuring their safe and secure deployment has never
    been more critical. Enter “guardrails,” a technology designed to mitigate risks
    and enhance the reliability of these models.

    different use-cases. We’ll also delve into “Nemo-Guardrails,” a cutting-edge library
    developed by NVIDIA. Specifically, I’ll demonstrate an alternative approach to
    integrating guardrails with LLMs, bypassing the conventional use of `.yml` configuration

    `.yml` format. These files allow you to specify which LLM to use, what kind of
    behavior you expect from it, and how it should interact with other services. For
    example, a simple configuration might look like this:'

    be used as the main LLM. The `.yml` files are highly customizable, allowing you
    to define various types of guardrails, actions, and even connect to different
    LLM providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While `.yml` files are a convenient and straightforward way to configure your
    LLMs, they aren’t the only option. This is particularly relevant if you’re interested
    in using LLM providers other than OpenAI, such as Azure. Some users have reported
    [challenges](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails/issues/72#issue-1803266059)
    when trying to configure these providers using `.yml` files alone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One alternative is to leverage LangChain’s Chat model. This approach allows
    you to directly pass the LLM configuration to Nemo-Guardrails. It’s especially
    useful for those who wish to use LLM providers that may not yet be fully supported
    in `.yml` configurations. For example, if you’re using Azure as your LLM provider,
    LangChain’s Chat model offers a way to integrate it seamlessly.
