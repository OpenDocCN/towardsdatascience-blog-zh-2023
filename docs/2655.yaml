- en: So you are used to train Deep Learning models with the free GPUs of Google Colab,
    but you are ready to level up and harness the power of a cluster, and you have
    no idea how to do that? Youâ€™re in the right place! ðŸš€

    training large models for Computer Vision tasks, and the free GPU provided by
    Google were not enough, so I decided to use the local cluster.

    of other people to try to understand them, and more or less compiled several things
    that were useful for me. Now I have compiled everything that is necessary to run
    basic python scripts. This guide is the one I wish I had during my time there.

    high resolution pictures. Something that would never run on Google colab.

    script is prepared. This script should contain the necessary codeâ€¦
