    I decided to add one more. Because it is an opportunity to discuss some underlying
    theories and frameworks.

    regression is a regressor, or logistic regression is a classifier. I will not
    defend a viewpoint, because the debate is kind of absurd to me.'

    that in the name “logistic regression”, there is “regression”, so for the ones
    who name this model this way, there is a reason why they consider it a regressor.
    Yes, I know, there can be misnomers, but still, you have to admit that there is
    a reason.

    that it is applied to classification tasks. For this reason, other people want
    to call it a classifier.

    life, we give different, sometimes contradictory statements for the seeming same
    subject, that is because we see it from different angles. So what is interesting
    is not the answer, but how we come to this answer.
