- en: The introduction of ChatGPT invigorated the scientific community, sparking philosophies
    around the place of ChatGPT; from boosting productivity to taking over the world.
    One idea is ChatGPT as a paradigm shift in computer programs. Throughout history,
    the computer program we‚Äôve come to know and love is a deterministic set of specific
    instructions, by following which we can reach a desired output. ChatGPT is like
    a computer program but enables users to communicate using natural language, than
    syntax coated instructions.
  prefs: []

- en: However, if a variable goes out of context in a computer program, that‚Äôs a clear
    error. But with LLMs, they just conjure up something to fill in the gaps. This
    can be a deal-breaker in some contexts. Imagine you trying to resolve a billing
    error with ChatGPT and ChatGPT hallucinates a sign-in error. That‚Äôll be a very
    confusing experience for a user.

    The [technical report](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) is already showing
    great promise with jaw-dropping performance boosts. For example, on grade-school
    mathematics problems, GPT-3.5 reaches 57.1% where GPT-4 sets the bar at 92%. Moreover,
    GPT-4 is reporting much better factual retrieval capabilities and less hallucination
    than ChatGPT.

    simple arithmetic operations, demonstrated sycophantic behaviors and hallucinated
    during this exercise. But this is just the beginning. ChatGPT‚Äôs successor, GPT-4
    has shown some remarkable improvements over ChatGPT. Moreover, researchers are
    finding ways to use natural language in novel ways to solve new problems such
    as recommendation.
