- en: As a researcher, reading and understanding scientific papers has always been
    a crucial part of my daily routine. I still remember the tricks I learned in grad
    school for how to digest a paper efficiently. However, with countless research
    papers being published every day, I felt overwhelmed to keep up to date with the
    latest research trends and insights. The old tricks I learned can only help so
    much.

    (LLMs). Thanks to their remarkable contextual understanding capability, LLMs can
    fairly accurately identify relevant information from the user-provided documents
    and generate high-quality answers to the user’s questions about the documents.
    A myriad of document Q&A tools have been developed based on this idea and some
    tools are designed specifically to assist researchers in understanding complex
    papers within a relatively short amount of time.

    using those tools. One of the main issues I had is prompt engineering. Since the
    quality of LLM responses depends heavily on the quality of my questions, I often…
