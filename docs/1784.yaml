    and `native.country` had absent observations. **The heatmap further tells us that
    there is a direct relationship with the missing pattern** in `occupation` and
    `workclass`: when there’s a missing value in one feature, the other will also
    be missing.'

    and how **the assessment of data quality issues and characteristics** — **a process
    we can refer to as Data Profiling** — is definitely a best practice.

    **goes beyond EDA.** Whereas we generally define EDA as the exploratory, interactive
    step before developing any type of data pipeline, **data profiling is an iterative
    process that** [**should occur at every step**](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-to-compare-2-dataset-with-pandas-profiling-2ae3a9d7695e)
    **of data preprocessing and model building.**

    know about what it entails — its *properties*, *relationships*, *issues* — so
    that you can later address them in the best way possible.

    guide you through an effective EDA,** and discussed the impact of having a top-notch
    tool — `ydata-profiling` — to point us in the right direction, and **save us a
    tremendous amount of time and mental burden.**
