    focusing on demographic trends in Tirana! In the first part, we looked at power
    law distributions and built spatial markov models to understand population changes
    over time. In this second part, I wanted to delve a bit deeper into these predictions
    and look at what they mean for specific neighborhoods in Tirana. Let’s get started!

    These areas of very rapid growth are also some with the highest need for sustainable
    solutions: Kashar grows with about 11 new people a day and has a relatively young
    median age of 33 ([source](https://siu.scan-tv.com/40-fakte-rreth-periferise-se-tiranes-farka-kashari-dhe-dajti-nga-popullsia-biznesi-deri-tek-atraksionet-turistike/)).'

    schools (together known as “9-vjecare”) ([link](https://ckan.tirana.al/dataset/institucionet-arsimore/resource/ff4e6d4b-c812-443d-8222-122c2da7b51e),

    outside of the 11 main admin areas. Namely, places like Shengjergj, Zall Bastar
    and Peze turn out to be the top 3\. What does this mean for the kids who attend
    these schools? Is it necessarily easier for them to go to school safely or reliably?

    that great. This tool, however, is useful when planning out building projects
    so that a place is easily accessible by the people meant to use it. What is a
    reasonable time to walk to and from school? How do we improve services like transit
    or biking so that children are able to go to their schools safely? As a starting
    point on these, it would be interesting to calculate isochrones for all of Tirana’s
    schools and compare them to how many children would be within walking distance.

- en: To measure inequalities in the spatial distribution, there’s a few other metrics
    we can use. **Spatial Autocorrelation** is one, and it consists of computing Moran’s
    I (which we did in for population counts in part 1). This is done to test the
    null hypothesis that schools in Tirana are distributed uniformly. The result from
    the test is **0.186 (p-value of 0.111).**

    Qualitatively, we interpret the plot as showing positive spatial autocorrelation
    when the data points exhibit a high correlation. The distribution, on the other
    hand, is an empirical one: it is obtained by simulating a series of maps with
    randomly distributed schools counts and then calculating Moran’s I for each of
    them. (blue line: mean of distribution, red line: observed statistic in Tirana’s

    science tools is something relatively unexplored, especially in the Albanian context,
    but definitely very useful. This project could be enriched with more fine-grained
    data (as in the schools example). Until then, here is the updated [notebook](https://github.com/DeaBardhoshi/AlbaniaExplorations).
