    be a spectacle of confusion and inefficiency. Yet, isn’t this precisely what happens

- en: 'Today, numerous data organisations are adopting **data contracts** as a means
    to enhance collaboration and drive efficiency. Drawing from my experience in advising
    companies on data strategy, I have noticed a recurring pattern: while these contracts
    often meticulously define the responsibilities of data providers — from ensuring
    data accuracy to maintaining stable schemas — they frequently overlook the role
    of the **data consumer**.'

    extracting value from that data is taken for granted or assumed to be automatic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data leaders and professionals who care about business value creation** should
    put more focus on the responsibilities of data consumers. If the consumer does
    not efficiently analyse, interpret, and apply the data within the context of their
    business, the data contract isn’t living up to its full potential. Therefore,
    a truly effective data contract should also detail the consumer’s obligations,
    ensuring that they are equipped and ready to leverage the data as envisaged.'

    can reduce the business impact of data contracts. And more importantly, we will
    explore practical measures to incorporate such commitments, fostering a business

    place data consumers in a passive role. Recently, I spoke with a Chief Data Officer
    at a utilities company who shared an enlightening example. They had just implemented
    self-service capabilities for users to access datasets directly on their data
    platform, Databricks. This initiative was a technical success, evidenced by a
    high number of accesses. However, the CDO expressed a common concern: despite
    the increased data access, there was no clear visibility into the downstream value
    generated. This scenario is a prime example of the disconnect that can occur when
    the focus is solely on providing access, not on how that access translates to
    business impact.'

- en: Commitments in data contracts come with their share of overhead. For data producers
    or data product owners, this means an ongoing investment in maintaining data pipelines,
    ensuring data quality, and providing the necessary infrastructure. While these
    tasks are critical, they can become costly, not just in financial terms but also
    in opportunity cost. It’s time to examine the consumer side to understand how
    these commitments can translate into tangible business value — or fail to do so.

    access to a data product for a project that doesn’t take off. The project is shelved,
    but the data product remains active, maintained at a cost, and ready for use.
    Although the data may be utilised effectively in other initiatives, in the context
    of this failed project, there’s a clear disconnect: the data product is maintained,
    incurring costs without delivering any value.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Worse still is when a project moves forward, and the data is used to create
    a new dashboard, only to find that it does not get adopted by the business. The
    dashboards become little more than digital paperweights, and the time and effort
    invested in them are wasted.
  prefs: []

- en: Even in successful cases where data use initially drives significant business
    value, the landscape can shift rapidly, leaving once-valuable projects obsolete.
    For instance, a consumer may leverage data to drive a particular initiative that
    yields high returns. Over time, however, as business needs change, the value of
    that initiative diminishes, yet the commitments and associated costs to maintain
    access to the data persist. The data product continues to be maintained according
    to the original contract, even when it no longer serves its initial high-value
    purpose.

    nature of business. They highlight the necessity for data consumer commitments
    to extend beyond access and usage to include the active pursuit of value generation,
    efficiency, and adaptability.

    side, there’s not just the responsibility to use data safely and legally but also
    to use it effectively and pivot as necessary to maintain alignment with business
    value. The next section will explore strategies to structure data consumer commitments
    that are flexible, value-focused, and capable of evolving with the business needs.'

    tapping into data products, they are in a prime position to ‘score the goals’

    understanding the need for accountability in how they utilise these data resources.

    products.'

    creation, ensuring data products consistently align with and contribute to the

    combination of culture, governance and tools.
