    the most convenient solutions. It is well established that users enter the app
    for a specific purpose, performing certain actions. But this sequence can be shortened

    These can be financial indicators (like reduced costs) and non-financial ones
    (e.g. the number of active users of the application, the accuracy of the built
    model, etc.). In addition to specific criteria, it is important to learn about

    years ago he hid in the backyard of the family house a chest with gold. He didn’t
    specify where exactly he did that, so the whole backyard would be a solution space.
    Once you read this letter you want to extract the treasure as soon as possible
    and think of using an escalator to find it. Unfortunately, the backyard is fenced
    and it is not possible to go there by escalator. In this case, the inability to
    use escalators would be a clear constraint within the solution space.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, the PSW approach works well for Data Science projects, where there
    is a clear vision of the task with some inputs from the client and initial trials
    of solving the task. In this case, customers can share this information with me
    in order to solve their challenge together with the help of PSW. However, in a
    case, when the project is characterised with a lot of unknown insights and unclear
    perspective, it would be difficult to apply the PSW tool. For instance, if clients
    request some idea generation for their Data Science project that hasn’t started
    yet, the PSW method won’t be applicable, and one needs to choose different ones.
