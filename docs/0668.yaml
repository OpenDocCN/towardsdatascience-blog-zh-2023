- en: Since the end of 2022, the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI has been considered by
    many of us to be the iPhone moment of AI. However, OpenAI’s chatbot is not the
    first generative AI text machine learning model and follows the launch of GPT-3,
    which was launched two years earlier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenAI provides us with a ready-to-use GPT-3 trained model. Furthermore, a specific
    task can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset. For example, suppose you want to
    create an email response generator specific to your company. First, you must collect
    a large amount of data about your particular business domain, such as customer
    email inquiries and responses. You can then use this data to fine-tune GPT-3 to
    learn your company’s specific language patterns and phrases. By fine-tuning GPT-3,
    creating a highly customized and specialized email response generator is possible,
    specifically tailored to the language patterns and words used in a particular
    business domain.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the content of the file *out_openai_completion.csv* is loaded into the
    data frame *df*. As a reminder, in our task, if the user enters ’40, female, healing’,
    we want to have a description of a 40-year-old female character with the power
    of healing. To perform fine-tuning, it is necessary to provide GPT with examples
    of what the user might type and the corresponding desired response. In the data
    frame *df*, the columns *sub_prompt* and *response_txt* contain examples of input
    with the corresponding desired response. In the code above, we first extract these
    two colons and then rename them to *prompt* and *completion*, respectively. The
    resulting data frame is stored in a new file *prepared_data.csv* containing only
    these two columns.

    giving the name of the JSONL file created just before. You will then need to select
    the model you wish to fine-tune. OpenAI offers four main models with different
    performance levels suitable for various tasks. *Davinci* is the most powerful
    model, and Ada is the fastest. *Davinci* is also the most expensive model 😨.
