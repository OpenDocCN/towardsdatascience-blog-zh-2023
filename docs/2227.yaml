- en: When it comes to Data Science, performing hypothesis tests, machine-learning,
    and even analytics, the most important component to getting results is having
    good data. There are a multitude of different requirements for data that often
    need to be imposed on that data. One technique that is incredibly common and is
    frequently used in the world of data is data filtering. Data filtering may either
    be the process of removing components of data that do not belong or the process
    of grabbing a sample that fits a certain parameter or number of parameters.

    is when we remove missing values from our data. This is an essential step in the
    Data Science process and is often done with filtering techniques. An example of
    grabbing a sample that fits some set parameters would be if we were trying to
    test statistical significance between being tall and bumping your head. We would
    filter out all of the data where people are short so that we had data of exclusively
    tall people to test with.

    for performing some common Data Science tasks, so it is…
