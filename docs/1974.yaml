    purpose was, and maybe one important detail (or achievement) you want them to
    have in mind before you dig into specific details.

    the technologies you used, and perhaps the surrounding architecture of your team/company
    will make it easier for the interviewer to follow and for you to reference specific
    components or technologies.

  prefs: []

    You can also **print your diagram and bring it to in-office interviews**. Personally,
    I can attest that every time I pulled my diagram out of my bag during an interview,
    my interviewers were deeply impressed by this level of preparation. It’s an unusual

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mock interviews are a great way to assess how your project sounds to an external
    listener, practice the coherence of your explanations, and improve your overall
    presentation. They provide an opportunity to receive concrete feedback from unbiased
    and professional individuals.
  prefs: []

    projects you want to present (ex-coworkers) and those who are unfamiliar with
    it. The former group can help identify any inaccuracies or suggest better ways
    to present your work, while the latter group can provide valuable feedback from
    the interviewer’s perspective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your field — experienced developers, and ideally, experienced interviewers, so
    that their feedback will be most relevant to you.
