- en: Apache Airflow is undoubtedly the most popular open-source project for data
    engineering for years. It gains popularity at the right time with [The Rise Of
    Data Engineer](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603),
    and the core concept of making code as the first-class citizen instead of drag
    and drop for data pipeline (aka. ETL) is a milestone. The Apache Airflow became
    an Apache Incubator project in March 2016 and became the top project in January
    2019\. I have worked on Apache Airflow since 2017 as a user. Along the way, I
    also contributed to Apache Airflow. Today, I want to share my journey with Airflow
    and what I learned over 6 years.

    who is an ex-Airbnb and ex-Facebook. He developed Airflow at Airbnb (*you can
    tell from the project name*). However, the core idea that inspired him was an
    internal tool used at Facebook.
