    and I have been taking a closer look at water distribution in general. So I wanted
    to understand how the shower screen, water diffuser, and water dispenser operated
    in how water went into the puck. Of course some of these parts are to facilitate
    a clean grouphead, but I went after a few questions:'

    have any CO2 left or very little. I then did salami shots and measured TDS.

    is measured using a refractometer, and this number combined with the output weight
    of the shot and the input weight of the coffee is used to determine the percentage
    of coffee extracted into the cup, called **Extraction Yield (EY)**.'

- en: For a shot profile, I did a flat profile at 90C at a flow of 2 ml/s. The end
    of this profile had a long slow ramp down to try to avoid sucking coffee grounds
    up into the grouphead.

- en: For dose, I had to increase the dose to reduce the headspace. I also didn’t
    know how far to go, so I modified tamping. I dosed, distributed, and tamped half
    the grounds first, then I dosed and distributed the second half. I didn’t tamp
    the second half.
  prefs: []

- en: The lack of a tamp allowed there to be little headspace without knowing the
    exact minimum. So one could study this a bit more and vary some parameters, but
    I did not. I wanted to gain some data guided intuition.

    but once it pressurized, it was the same.

- en: I really expected the shower screen and the diffuser to have a positive impact
    on shot quality. These results are not conclusive or for every machine, but at
    the very least, they point towards a gap in public knowledge on the grouphead
    design. The design can’t be solely based on a single shot but function to produce
    multiple shots by keeping the equipment cleaner for longer.
