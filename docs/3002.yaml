    plethora of techniques to choose from. One such method that often gets ignored
    but can be incredibly useful in certain scenarios is Complementary Log-Log (Cloglog)
    Regression. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what Cloglog regression
    is, when to use it, and how it works.

- en: Cloglog regression is a statistical modelling technique used to analyze binary
    response variables. As we know when it comes to modelling binary outcomes, the
    first model that strikes our mind is logistic regression. Actually, cloglog is
    an alternative to logistic regression in special scenarios. I am assuming that
    you all have a basic understanding of logistic regression. However, if you are
    unfamiliar with logistic regression, it is advised to first gain a fundamental
    understanding of it. There is a wealth of online resources available on logistic
    regression that can help familiarize you with the topic.

    useful when the probability of an event is very small or very large. Most of the
    time cloglog regression is used while dealing with rare events or situations where
    the outcome is extremely skewed.

    of ‘x’, the probability of the outcome remains relatively low, while for larger
    values, the probability of the outcome becomes higher. The curve exhibits symmetry
    around the value of 0.5 for ‘Y’. This symmetry implies that in logistic regression,
    there exists an underlying characteristic where the distribution of the probability
    of success or event occurrence (Y = 1) is symmetrically distributed around 0.5\.
    This implies that the most significant change in probability occurs in the middle
    of the graph, while the probability remains relatively less sensitive at extreme
    values of ‘x’. This assumption holds true when our outcome variable has a substantial
    number of cases with success or events, as demonstrated by examples such as:'

    are symmetric around the value 0.5, the cloglog transformation exhibits asymmetry.
    In logistic and probit functions, the probability changes at a similar rate when
    approaching both 0 and 1\. In cases where the data is not symmetric within the
    [0, 1] interval and increases slowly at small to moderate values but sharply near
    1, the logit and probit models may not be suitable choices. In such situations,
    where asymmetry in the response variable is evident, the complementary log-log
    model (cloglog) emerges as a promising alternative, offering improved modelling
    capabilities. From the graph of the Cloglog function, we can see that P(Y = 1)
    approaches 0 relatively slowly and approaches 1 sharply.'

    the Odds Ratio:'

    the p-value for BMI is 0.52, suggesting that it is not significantly associated
