- en: Germany is not only the largest economy in Europe, but it is also a country
    with beautiful landscapes and an interesting culture. Unsurprisingly, Germany
    is a popular destination for tourists and expats from all over the world. Exploratory
    data analysis of the German housing rental market can be interesting not only
    for data analysts but also for people who are going to live and work in this country.
    I will show some interesting trends that can be found with Python, Pandas, and
    Bokeh.

- en: To find the data, I decided to use ImmoScout24, which is not only one of the
    biggest (about 72K apartments and houses are listed there at the time of writing
    this article), but also the oldest website of this type. According to [https://web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/),
    the first version was made in 1999, more than 20 years ago. ImmoScout24 also has
    an API and a page for developers. I contacted the PR department, and they gave
    me permission to use the website data for this publication but were not able to
    give me an API key. Probably this API is intended only for partners, to add or
    edit the housing data but not for batch reading…
