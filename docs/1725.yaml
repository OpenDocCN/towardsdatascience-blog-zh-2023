- en: Just recently, the owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, John Fischer,
    announced that the team had purchased close to 50 acres of land in Las Vegas,
    Nevada. [1] This puts the future of Oakland’s last remaining professional sports
    team in jeopardy. In the last 5 years, Oakland has seen the Golden State Warriors
    (NBA) and Las Vegas Raiders (NFL) depart for newer shinier stadiums in other cities
    (although, Golden State just went across the Bay Bridge to San Francsico). While
    the decision-making process in the Oakland A’s front office remains a mystery
    to me, data science and decision analysis in tandem can reveal a great deal about
    John Fischer’s motives to move to Las Vegas.

- en: Decision analysis is important for all data scientists to understand because
    it is the bridge between the highly technical work of probability and statistical
    models and business decisions. Understanding how business decisions are made can
    help frame our work and the presentation of our findings to non-technical audiences
    as we provide actionable recommendations and findings. The Institute for Operations
    Research and Management Science (INFORMS) even has an [entire society](https://connect.informs.org/das/home)…
