- en: Linear equations and systems of linear equations have a variety of real-world
    applications in the domains of Finance, Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science,
    Statistics, and Physics and beyond. In Chemistry, linear equations are used to
    balance chemical reactions and calculate the quantities of reactants and products.
    This cornerstone of Linear Algebra also appears in Physics where linear equations
    are used within Kinematics and Thermodynamics to describe the motion of objects,
    helping calculate distances, speeds, and accelerations and model heat transfer
    and energy flow in physical systems respectively. The financial field relies on
    linear equations and systems for budgeting and portfolio analysis while engineers
    might use the same tools to conduct structural analysis to model forces and stresses
    in buildings. Linear Algebra is ubiquitous; everyone can appreciate it to some
    degree.

- en: As linear equations become more complex, the notation may become unwieldy. It’s
    important for the information of a linear system to be condensed to be easy to
    manipulate and work with, and so matrix notation is often used in favour of a
    set of equations. A **coefficient matrix** isa type ofmatrix that excludes the
    *b* coefficient from each equation. An **augmented matrix** is inclusive of the
    *b* coefficient, hence it has one more column than a coefficient matrix.

    and columns a matrix has. A *m x n* matrix is a matrix with *m* rows and *n* columns.
    The number of rows corresponds to how many linear equations a system has while
    the number of columns tells us how many variables there are. Take care to ensure
    that the number of rows precedes the number of columns as the order is not interchangeable.

    if so, if it has a unique solution or infinite solutions, and from there, obtain
    the solutions. Solving a linear system can be performed using linear equations
    in their original form or with a matrix though it is recommended to use a matrix
    as the notation is cleaner and more compact. It is good however to be well acquainted
    with both methods because they provide additional insight into the mechanics of
    the other.

    sans-matrix. The basic idea is to create new equations through multiplying preexisting
    ones to obtain identical equations that can be then added or subtracted from another
    equation to eliminate one variable. This process is then repeated until we’ve
    eliminated enough unknowns from the system to be able to solve for one variable
    and then work our way back up to solve for the rest through back substitution.
    At the end, a check is needed to ensure that the solution actually satisfies the
    system of equations.

    equations method. Unsurprisingly, we wind up with the same equations from before.
    Something else to make note of is the triangular formation in the bottom left
    corner of the final matrix. It makes sense for this pattern to emerge because
    the 0s are markers of an eliminated variable and each variable eliminated brings
    us closer to identifying an equation we can solve easily for; this in turn makes
    progress in solving the system as a whole. We’ll revisit this occurrence and I
    will provide a more formal definition for it in the next chapter.
