    no Computer Science background to having deep experience in the field. I’ve had
    the opportunity to play pivotal roles such as Sr Software Engineer/Data Engineer,

    Whether it was my old Windows machine or taking apart pieces of my car’s engine.
    I had a fascination for how things were built. Despite these interests, my undergraduate
    years were full of transitory goals from studies in Architecture to Fine Arts.
    It was not until the late 2000’s, when I was deep into my Bachelors of Fine Arts
    program, when I had my first “Interaction Design” course that I realized, almost
    instantly, I wanted to work in the Software Industry. Something *clicked*, and
