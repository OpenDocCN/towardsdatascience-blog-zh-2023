    and join our community at different points of their data science journey. We’re
    especially proud to support data professionals at the earliest stages of their
    career, but we also know that there’s no universal definition for what “beginner”
    means these days.

    to our [Getting Started column](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/getting-started)—the
    space where we collect standout articles that also happen to be patiently explained,
    and that don’t require extensive or specialized knowledge of the topic at hand.

    range from machine learning project design to a data-engineering tutorial. Since
    none of us can be an expert in everything, their thematic diversity means that
    more advanced data scientists will almost certainly find something new and interesting
    to explore as well.'

    If you’ve been tinkering with gradient-boosted algorithms, chances are high you’ve
    run into LightGBM. In case you could use some guidance on how to make the most
    of it, [Leonie Monigatti](https://medium.com/u/3a38da70d8dc?source=post_page-----96ef4ea61216--------------------------------)’s
    introduction to the most essential LightGBM parameters is clear, actionable, and

    deep dive is a good starting point if you’re not sure how this concept might relate

    Apache Airflow might be a common tool for data engineering teams, but as [Aashish
    Nair](https://medium.com/u/3087ba81e065?source=post_page-----96ef4ea61216--------------------------------)
    points out, its ubiquity doesn’t make its terminology, features, and quirks any
    less daunting. To help, Aashish presents a Python-based demo that walks readers
    through the process of creating a simple Airflow pipeline.'

    overview of perceptrons—“one of the earliest computational models of neural networks”—is
    a gentle entryway into the topic, and covers the basic concepts before moving
