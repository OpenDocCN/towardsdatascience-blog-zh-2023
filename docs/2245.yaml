    and has been widely parroted since. However, the analogy holds merit in only a
    few aspects (e.g. the value of both usually increases with refinement) and data’s
    broader economic impact has been muted outside of a select few tech and finance
    companies. But the actual differences between oil and data are fundamental.

    which makes oil from different sources substitutes (in economic terms it is a
    “homogenous good”). It is ubiquitous and has a well established price. Not least,
    if you have a barrel of oil, you can’t simply make a copy to produce another —
    oil is a limited resource that has to be pulled from the ground.

    A thought experiment helps: Consider some of the most important predictive tasks

    most likely to purchase next. For an oil exploration company, it could be where

    and reduce that spoilage. At [about 20% gross margin](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?ind=1305),
    every percentage point reduction in spoilage would improve their gross margin
    by 0.8pp. So, for a company like Albertsons, every percentage point improvement
    in predicting demand could be worth an estimated $640M per year. Alternative data

    How did people buy ads? They told an agency what kind of audience they wanted
    to reach. Then the agency looked at the publishers they worked with and their
    “inventory” (magazine pages, billboards, TV ad slots, …), and put together a plan
    of where to run a campaign to meet those requirements. After some negotiations
    the company and the agency eventually signed a contract. Ad creative would be
    developed, reviewed, and approved. Insertion orders would be submitted and eventually
    the ad campaign would run. A few months later the company would get a report on
    how the agency thought it went (based on a small sampled dataset).

    ad buying. Google created its own ad exchange (AdX) that connected the inventory
    from multiple publishers with different ad networks. As users performed search
    or visited websites, it ran a real time auction (yes, within the time it takes
    to load a webpage) that pitched all advertisers against each other and picked
    the highest bidder (actually, [2nd highest](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2012/10/27/google-adwords-auction-a-second-price-sealed-bid-auction/))
