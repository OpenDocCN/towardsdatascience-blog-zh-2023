    I had been working in data engineering for three years and the initial excitement
    of starting in the world of tech had faded. I was beginning to realize that I
    wasn’t as passionate about my work as I had hoped.

    order to find out what you actually want to do. This can mean pursuing hobbies
    outside of your 9–5 that bring you joy, or getting involved with different teams
    at the company you already work at.

    so I decided to start exploring my options there. I began talking with data analysts
    who solved business problems every day using data. They were like data engineers
    with way more business exposure!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By asking for data analytics projects, I learned how to use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)
    and further developed my Python skills. Playing around with new technologies helped
    me to see that I still enjoyed working in data, I just had to be using the right
    tools and solving the right problems. Eventually, this led to me seeking out a
    different role that was more aligned with these new-found interests and skill
    sets. **This role happened to be that of an analytics engineer.**

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of people are scared to make the transition from data engineer to analytics
    engineer because they don’t know if the time is right. The truth is, there will
    never be a “right” time to do anything. However, if you’re feeling unchallenged
    and unfulfilled, you can never make this choice too soon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transitioning from data engineering to analytics engineering is probably right
    for you **if you are curious about the data itself rather than building products
    that support the data**. Analytics engineering is way more customer-oriented because
    you are using your customers’ data to answer key business questions. You are more
    so focusing on growing revenue and insight rather than building things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This brings me to my second point. If you’re wanting more of a connection to
    the business, and want to be making decisions that drive growth for the company,
    analytics engineering may be the move for you. As a data engineer, you are assigned
    tasks by a project manager. You don’t necessarily have a say in what you’re solving
    or what you think needs to be prioritized. But with analytics engineering, you
    do.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Truth be told, I had no idea what analytics engineering was when I realized
    I wanted to switch data roles. I thought my only option for working closer to
    the business was to become a data analyst. And that’s exactly what I tried to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I applied for so many data analyst roles, but wasn’t having much luck. I lacked
    a lot of that deep business experience needed by an analyst, as well as the skills
    to build out proper dashboards. Rather than on job title, I started to focus on
    roles that had a mix of skills that I already had and those that I wanted to learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Eventually, I stumbled upon the role of an analytics engineer. This role required
    knowledge of SQL, Python, AWS, orchestration, dbt, and data warehousing, all skillsets
    I had gained as a data engineer. However, it also required experience working
    with modern data stack tools, communicating with business teams, and some basic
    BI reporting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While I hadn’t had much modern data stack experience, I was lucky to find a
    company that believed in my passion and desire to learn. Sometimes if the fit
    is right, the company is willing to hire you without all of the requirements!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few skills I spent time really developing before seeking out an
    analytics engineering role. These are the skills that are most essential and will
    give you a leg up over other candidates. **If you focus on these three skills,
    I’m confident that you can easily teach yourself on the job the other skills required
    to be a good analytics engineer.**

- en: dbt, or data build tool, is the data transformation tool that really carved
    the way for analytics engineers. In fact, the company behind it is the one who
    coined the name analytics engineer! While you don’t necessarily have to know dbt
    to be an analytics engineer, it’s a skill a lot of companies are looking for when
    hiring for the role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dbt is a SQL-based tool, so if you already know SQL, it is fairly easy to learn.
    You would need to familiarize yourself with setting up a dbt project, data modeling
    best practices, and the purpose of each type of dbt data model. I recommend checking
    out [dbt style guides](/the-most-efficient-way-to-organize-dbt-models-244e23c17072)
    for an outline of the “do”s and “don’t”s of writing SQL code in dbt. This will
    help you learn the standards that you may already see in place when you join a
    team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: dbt also uses a templating language called Jinja for documentation and functions
    within the tool. However, instead of calling them functions, dbt calls them macros.
    Macros are a more advanced feature and are the equivalent to functions. You can
    use them to automate SQL output within your data models. While this isn’t necessary
    to land a job, it’s definitely a helpful skill to make your life of an analytics
    engineer easier.

- en: This is probably the most difficult skill to develop and practice as a data
    engineer. We are so used to talking technically with other engineers that we forget
    to explain things in an easy-to-understand way. When communicating with business
    teams, you need to know how to explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience.
    The simpler the better. The crowd that you are talking to is almost never going
    to be as technical as you are.
  prefs: []

- en: In addition to this, you need to understand the business lingo that these teams
    speak. You will constantly hear different metrics like CAC, MRR, NPM, and ROI.
    Make sure you know what these mean! Chances are, these are the reasons you are
    building a data model in the first place. You need to understand the end goals/metrics
    and the data that goes into calculating them.

    Building data pipelines is a common skill of many data engineers that can also
    be used as an analytics engineer. However, in this context, it’s important you
    know how to orchestrate different dbt models with various data sources. You need
    to be able to deal with dependencies from a bunch of different source systems.
  prefs: []

    and Dagster. These are all built using simple Python, another important skill
    to have for building out a pipeline. Pick one tool and familiarize yourself with
    it! Once you learn one, you most likely can learn them all.

    is a ton of overlap between analytics engineering and data engineering! Oftentimes,
    the skills you learn as a data engineer become your biggest superpower. You can
    probably do things other analytics engineers can’t, so embrace it!

    roles, especially if you are looking for a data role at a small company who is
    just beginning to hire out its data team. Chances are, they are looking to get
    the most bang for their buck, and want someone who can do a little bit of everything.
    An eager data engineer turned analytics engineer is just the person for the job!

    *I need to know how to set up an open-source data connector like Airbyte before
    I apply for that role. I need to have experience building custom macros in dbt
    before I appy for that role. I can’t apply for that role until I master every
    type of SQL window function.*
  prefs: []

    you unique? Why would someone want to hire you over someone else? Think about
    the things that can’t be learned on the job that makes you stand out. The industry
    is always changing, meaning there’s always going to be something you don’t know.
    Embrace it! That’s one of the best parts about analytics engineering.

    was. I was actually introduced to it through dbt’s documentation when I was first
    experimenting with organizing our data warehouse and modeling our data. Eventually,
    I was able to learn what that was, apply the techniques to my work, and improve
    my data modeling skills. Now I can talk to you for days about dimensional modeling!

    that is not serving you, the more you miss out on opportunities to learn and grow.
    Every time I’ve made a career switch it was because I was no longer being challenged
    by my work. If we aren’t learning new things and growing as a person, we are staying
    the same. And is there anything worse than that?
  prefs: []

    by exploring your options. Browse different roles and see what companies are looking
    for. What are the commonalities in skills between job postings? Is there anything
    you think you *wouldn’t* like about an analytics engineering role? Looking at
    job descriptions is a great way to find this out!

    to analytics engineering. Deep down I knew that a purely technical role just wasn’t
    right for me. I needed to work with data hands-on, using it to solve customer
    and business problems.
  prefs: []

    to explore what else is out there whether that is analytics engineering or not.
    What’s the worst thing that can happen? If you make a jump and realize that actually
    isn’t for you, you can always go back to your old role. But, you will never know
    unless you try!
