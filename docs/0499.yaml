    to develop Machine Learning models, so data is the foundation of any project in
    this area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is logical to think that data access must occur precisely so that the correct
    data is selected when needed. However, this task can be difficult when we are
    dealing with large projects or projects that end up extending for long periods
    of time. During the development, several databases can be generated and, if they
    are not correctly cataloged, they can end up confusing, leading to decisions being
    taken wrongly.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, it is a very simple and intuitive structure, yet people (and I was included
    here) tend to save all the data in the same folder. Nowadays I like to have a
    separate folder for each project that I work on and, for each project, I always
    have a separate folder for the raw data, which contains the initial information,
    and the processed data, which contains data after some type of preprocessing is
    performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very useful to save the processed data so you don’t have to run the whole
    preprocessing pipeline to generate the dataset you will use to make your models
    or your analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my experience, I learned that it is a good practice to keep the versions
    of the data that was used throughout the project, because you can use it to compare
    different results obtained and you guarantee the replicability of previously results
    and analyzes. However, a while after the end of the project it is good to clear
    some of the old files to reduce the amount of storage used.

- en: Usually in a data science project there are several steps that need to be done
    to reach a result. For instance, if you are developing a Machine Learning model
    for a specific task some steps are pretty common such as the development of the
    database that will be used, the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), the development
    of the preprocessing pipeline, the tuning of the model and the evaluation of the
    results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these tasks usually requires a reasonable amount of lines of code to
    be carried out, which makes having them all in the same notebook impractical,
    due to the enormous amount of information present in the same file. The chances
    of the notebook becoming confused and messy with so much information are very
    high, even applying the tips that I will talk about in the next topics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another point worth mentioning is that the notebook can become so computationally
    expensive that the kernel can become unstable if you try to run all the cells
    in sequence, leading to the loss of precious minutes, or hours.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basically I order my notebooks in chronological development (using numbers in
    the file name to sort them), I give very clear and explicit names to what was
    developed in each notebook, I create folders to store generated files to make
    it easier to find them in the future. In addition to facilitating the organization
    of information, following this structure makes it clear what were the steps taken
    to arrive at the result and what was the reasoning used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again, using this organization structure, or one similar to it, is an extremely
    simple task to accomplish, requiring only discipline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    write and to think as well as to be disciplined.

    you are doing each part of the same notebook. For this topic, the option to write
    in Markdown will be your best friend. That’s because you can use the different
    styles to differentiate between topics and subtopics of your code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For me, this part is almost the same as writing a report, where you have to
    clearly state what are your intentions with each experiment, your hypothesis,
    results and analysis that you are making. The tricky part is that you have to
    be very clear in your goals and analysis to do a good job, and this requires thinking
    ahead and being objective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being organized in the structure of the notebook helps a lot in making things
    easy to explain, which is a very good think when you are going to make a presentation
    of your analysis to your peers and superiors.

    of the notebook. However, I have found that this work is often rewarded with clearer
    sense of the goals that I am pursuing with each analysis and the results obtained.
    This has helped me a lot, specially when working with more than one project at
    the same time.

    explaining it to someone else. Use a lot of comments throughout your code and
    always try to be as clear as possible. At the beginning this habit will be a little
    hard to do and you will be feel a little laziness to comment your codes, but over
    time you end up becoming very good at commenting things quickly and effectively,
    doing things practically automatically. Always try to be as direct as possible,
    saving on words and the time needed to understand what you said.'

    no use making an extremely useful function if nobody knows what it’s for! Here,
    the use of docstrings is highly recommended. Again, be very detailed in your explanations
    of their functions, but try not to use too many words.

    what is the function’s purpose (in the Info section), what are the function’s

    if any (in the Output section) . Below is an example of a function I made for
    another article of mine here on Medium: [Genetic Algorithm and its practicality
    in Machine Learning](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/genetic-algorithm-6aefd897f1ac).'

- en: The practice of commenting and organizing your codes is extremely useful, not
    only for you to be clear about what you do, but also for your code to be of use
    to other people in your organization. Reusable, well-made and organized codes
    are very valuable within a team as they end up saving the time of several employees
    when performing a repeated or similar task.

- en: Another important point is that if you happen to go on vacation or leave in
    the middle of a project, if your code is well organized, you will be able to pick
    up where you left off much faster than if you need to remember everything you
    did or what prompted you to write the several lines of code several days ago.

- en: In this article I showed you several benefits of being more organized in your
    work. Being organized makes you more efficient, clear and objective, in addition
    to exercising your discipline and thinking, because to write the result of an
    analysis or a comment in a code, you must first think about what you are going
    to write. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself rewriting something more than
    once, that is, most of the time, you exercising your critical sense and looking
    for a more efficient way to express yourself, forcing you to exercise this very
    important skill.

    help you a lot. Being able to clearly answer a question asked by a superior or
    clearly explain what your objectives were with an analysis or a part of a code
    are things that will add points to your work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, my tip is to start little by little and adapt the way you organize
    things in such a way that it is the best possible for you. The ways I’ve described
    here were ways I adapted for myself and they serve me very well, but sometimes
    you’re better off using a different way of organizing. Be that as it may, being
    organized will only bring you benefits.
