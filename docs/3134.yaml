- en: Today’s column is partly about data science, but it’s also about the sociology
    of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career
    long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed.
    I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years
    of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist,
    were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways
    that made it possible for me to get where I am. My development into a data scientist
    was not just about coursework and studying, it was about learning how to be a
    data scientist in all kinds of ways, many of which were subtly absorbed by being
    around other data scientists and doing the job.

  zh: 今天的专栏部分涉及数据科学，但也涉及工作的社会学。作为该领域的高级从业者，我在Covid-19以及我们今天工作方式的根本转变之前很久就开始了我的数据科学职业生涯。我在那之前几年就开始了我的职业生涯。因此，我的多年学习如何成为任何职业人士（更不用说专业数据科学家了）是在与许多更有经验的人紧密相处中度过的，这在很多方面使我能够达到现在的位置。我的数据科学家发展不仅仅是关于课程学习和研究，它还涉及以各种方式学习如何成为数据科学家，其中许多都是通过与其他数据科学家在一起工作和进行工作而微妙地吸收的。
- en: It’s important to recognize that work isn’t only about what we give to our employers,
    even under capitalism. It’s also about what we get back, and not only in monetary
    terms. Workplaces and jobs have many social and cultural impacts on us, beyond
    just collecting a paycheck. In particular, we develop our social identities through
    professions, and we learn how to embody those identities by seeing how other people
    enact them.

  zh: 规范
- en: We develop cultural and social norms from working, by observing the behavior
    of others, particularly others above us in the hierarchy. Business jargon, norms
    for attire, and social niceties, for example, can all develop through mostly indirect
    learning in the workplace. In some workplaces, especially white collar ones, these
    norms represent tools for building social capital and even class mobility. In
    data science, there are some norms that are generalizable across the field, or
    within different industries where data scientists practice. For example, in tech
    data science, casual dress is certainly the norm. There are also unspoken standards
    for how you interact with your boss and other people in leadership, including
    how you communicate about technical topics. There are tons of norms around how
    to just be a professional in general, too - how to handle business travel, interacting
    with customers, and so on. These skills are all essential for professional success
    sooner or later, but in my experience they’re things you learn mostly by observation
    and osmosis.

  zh: 我们通过工作发展文化和社会规范，通过观察他人的行为，尤其是观察我们层级中更高职位的人的行为。例如，商业术语、着装规范和社交礼仪等，都可以通过在工作场所的间接学习而发展。在一些工作场所，特别是白领工作场所，这些规范代表了建立社会资本甚至阶层流动的工具。在数据科学领域，有一些规范是可以跨领域通用的，或者在不同的数据科学实践行业中通用。例如，在技术数据科学领域，休闲装确实是常态。还有一些关于如何与你的老板和其他领导者互动的无形标准，包括如何沟通技术话题。还有许多关于如何成为一个专业人士的规范——如何处理商务旅行、与客户互动等等。这些技能对于职业成功迟早都是必不可少的，但根据我的经验，这些大多是通过观察和渗透学习的。

    something to be successful in a new job. In my case, coming in to data science
    after some years in academia, I had a lot to learn about how to take what I knew
    about data science and machine learning and apply it to business problems, rather
    than academic ones. I learned new algorithms, coding best practices, and many
    other skills from colleagues in data science jobs I’ve held, particularly my first
    one. This wasn’t all formal training by any means — a significant amount of it
    was passive learning by watching and absorbing how other, more experienced and
    successful folks did things. Relatedly, we learn about our “unknown unknowns”.
    We all have blind spots, especially when we’re starting out, and we don’t realize
    we’re missing a piece of the puzzle or an approach that might be useful, until
    that absence is pointed out to us. Observing colleagues who use a skill you didn’t
    know existed can open the door for you to build that skill yourself.

  zh: 我们还从工作场所获得了实际技能，因为几乎每个人都需要学习一些东西，以在新工作中获得成功。以我为例，经过几年的学术生涯后进入数据科学领域，我需要学习如何将我所了解的数据科学和机器学习应用于商业问题，而不是学术问题。我从我曾担任的数据科学职位的同事那里，特别是我的第一个职位中，学到了新的算法、编码最佳实践以及许多其他技能。这些并不全是正式培训——其中相当一部分是通过观察和吸收其他经验丰富且成功的人士如何做事的方式进行的被动学习。相关地，我们还了解了我们的“未知未知”。我们都有盲点，特别是当我们刚开始时，我们没有意识到自己缺少了一块拼图或一种可能有用的方法，直到这些缺失被指出来为止。观察那些使用你不知道存在的技能的同事可以为你打开构建该技能的大门。

    and network creation that workplaces provide. Ideally, when you join a team or
    a business, you develop relationships with the other people involved, and those
    connections are the glue of a professional network that can help your career develop
    in the future. If you don’t make those linkages, you will be disadvantaged not
    just in your current job, but down the road. I for one am incredibly fortunate
    to have a strong professional network developed through collegiality that has
    been instrumental in my career success. Data scientists are great people, and
    we help each other find opportunities and make connections, but you need a way
    to break in to those networks when joining the profession. Often this is made
    easier by having more experienced colleagues who will make introductions and informally
    vouch for you.

    most of us data scientists are going to have in coming months and years, if we
    haven’t already. Fully in-office work is not coming back for most of us, because
    we have gotten a taste for the autonomy and flexibility of remote work, and realized
    how much of an improvement this is for our quality of life. Data scientists have
    a skill set in high enough demand that we can get this flexibility in roles if
    we want it.

    into some office park or downtown three days a week is not the only way to do
    work where people sometimes see each other in person and other times don’t, and
    it’s frustrating to see how tone deaf the conversation is on this. I’d regard
    most conceptions of hybrid work as “Some or mostly remote work with sloppy, haphazard
    facetime”. This is because they’re trying to create hybrid in the mold of pre-Covid
    workplaces. It’s a function of having very little understanding of what we want
    work to be, and what the worthwhile tradeoffs are.

    a quarterly on-site, where people travel to a central place (not just a regional
    or local office), and do things like strategic planning, collaborative work, spend
    some time socially, and learn from each other. There are myriad other possibilities
    of how you could split this time, but the point is that it is face time with a
    purpose, and it’s designed to fulfill that purpose.

    in pre-Covid workplaces came from the peripheral socialization. Chats over the
    coffee machine are a cliche, but they actually do make opportunities for colleagues
    to get more familiar. That’s why sloppy and haphazard face time hybrid work is
    entirely different from purposeful face time — having interactions for social
