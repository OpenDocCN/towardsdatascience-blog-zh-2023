    of work. As a senior practitioner in the field, I started my data science career
    long before Covid-19 and the radical shift in the way we work today developed.
    I started my professional career years before even that. As a result, my years
    of learning how to be a professional anything, let alone a professional data scientist,
    were spent in close quarters with much more experienced people, and in many ways
    that made it possible for me to get where I am. My development into a data scientist
    was not just about coursework and studying, it was about learning how to be a
    data scientist in all kinds of ways, many of which were subtly absorbed by being
    around other data scientists and doing the job.

    even under capitalism. It’s also about what we get back, and not only in monetary
    terms. Workplaces and jobs have many social and cultural impacts on us, beyond
    just collecting a paycheck. In particular, we develop our social identities through
    professions, and we learn how to embody those identities by seeing how other people
    enact them.

    into professional data scientists isn’t that much about math skills, but more
    about social norms, developing networks, and getting acclimated to the context
    of our work. A lot of these elements are tough to acquire at the best of times,
    and we are now in a situation where remote and hybrid work are going to require
    us to come up with new ways for this information and culture transmission to work.

    of others, particularly others above us in the hierarchy. Business jargon, norms
    for attire, and social niceties, for example, can all develop through mostly indirect
    learning in the workplace. In some workplaces, especially white collar ones, these
    norms represent tools for building social capital and even class mobility. In
    data science, there are some norms that are generalizable across the field, or
    within different industries where data scientists practice. For example, in tech
    data science, casual dress is certainly the norm. There are also unspoken standards
    for how you interact with your boss and other people in leadership, including
    how you communicate about technical topics. There are tons of norms around how
    to just be a professional in general, too - how to handle business travel, interacting
    with customers, and so on. These skills are all essential for professional success
    sooner or later, but in my experience they’re things you learn mostly by observation
    and osmosis.

    something to be successful in a new job. In my case, coming in to data science
    after some years in academia, I had a lot to learn about how to take what I knew
    about data science and machine learning and apply it to business problems, rather
    than academic ones. I learned new algorithms, coding best practices, and many
    other skills from colleagues in data science jobs I’ve held, particularly my first
    one. This wasn’t all formal training by any means — a significant amount of it
    was passive learning by watching and absorbing how other, more experienced and
    successful folks did things. Relatedly, we learn about our “unknown unknowns”.
    We all have blind spots, especially when we’re starting out, and we don’t realize
    we’re missing a piece of the puzzle or an approach that might be useful, until
    that absence is pointed out to us. Observing colleagues who use a skill you didn’t
    know existed can open the door for you to build that skill yourself.

- en: Beyond this, there’s a more abstract but still important element of camaraderie
    and network creation that workplaces provide. Ideally, when you join a team or
    a business, you develop relationships with the other people involved, and those
    connections are the glue of a professional network that can help your career develop
    in the future. If you don’t make those linkages, you will be disadvantaged not
    just in your current job, but down the road. I for one am incredibly fortunate
    to have a strong professional network developed through collegiality that has
    been instrumental in my career success. Data scientists are great people, and
    we help each other find opportunities and make connections, but you need a way
    to break in to those networks when joining the profession. Often this is made
    easier by having more experienced colleagues who will make introductions and informally
    vouch for you.

    all of these components in some way (and probably others besides, depending on
    the situation). But, as I mentioned, the physical context of work has changed
    a lot (and for the better, I think) since I started my career. How do we bring
    new practitioners into the field in this new world?

    most of us data scientists are going to have in coming months and years, if we
    haven’t already. Fully in-office work is not coming back for most of us, because
    we have gotten a taste for the autonomy and flexibility of remote work, and realized
    how much of an improvement this is for our quality of life. Data scientists have
    a skill set in high enough demand that we can get this flexibility in roles if
    we want it.

- en: It’s important to spend time on the disambiguation of what “hybrid” means. Commuting
    into some office park or downtown three days a week is not the only way to do
    work where people sometimes see each other in person and other times don’t, and
    it’s frustrating to see how tone deaf the conversation is on this. I’d regard
    most conceptions of hybrid work as “Some or mostly remote work with sloppy, haphazard
    facetime”. This is because they’re trying to create hybrid in the mold of pre-Covid
    workplaces. It’s a function of having very little understanding of what we want
    work to be, and what the worthwhile tradeoffs are.

    and scarcely interact with is a poor way for a junior data scientist to achieve
    the benefits I described above, if they would be achieved at all. And the tradeoffs
    to them, their families, and the community are tremendous. Commuting is terrible
    for our individual health and social welfare and our environmental health, to
    say nothing of a waste of valuable time we could be spending in productive ways.
    If we are going to spend time traveling to a place of work, it had better be worth
    it.

    purposeful facetime”. An example of this might be day to day remote work with
    a quarterly on-site, where people travel to a central place (not just a regional
    or local office), and do things like strategic planning, collaborative work, spend
    some time socially, and learn from each other. There are myriad other possibilities
    of how you could split this time, but the point is that it is face time with a
    purpose, and it’s designed to fulfill that purpose.

    remote work might be fine. We have broken in to the networks, learned the social
    norms, and have acquired skills (and, most importantly, channels for updating
    our skills) that don’t require special face time. I’d argue, though, that we do
    have a responsibility to lend a hand to those coming up after us, and that spending
    some purposeful time in person with junior peers represents giving back and is
    worthwhile.

    because every company and organization is not the same, and one size doesn’t fit
    all. However, I have a few suggestions for the specific targets I’ve described
    above.
  prefs: []

    just hope that your junior staff will immediately understand how interpersonal
    expectations work. We might not have had to spell these things out when everyone
    was spending 40+ hours a week side by side, but that may have changed. Be more
    explicit than you think you need to be. Some of the passive absorption of these
    norms will happen during intentional face time too.'

    depending on who you ask, but usually involve some mix of coding, statistics and
    machine learning, and business acumen and communication. These are all things
    that we develop and improve by doing the job, but we also gain these skills by
    observing how other people do the job. By creating collaborative working opportunities
    in your intentional face time, and not just focusing on tedious meetings, you
    can help this skill transmission happen.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Networks**: I honestly think building networks can be the hardest thing to
    do with remote working data scientists, because we so frequently do our day to
    day work alone. Even though you’ll have model and code reviews as a team, and
    may connect at stand ups, meetings, and hackathons, a lot of the network development
    in pre-Covid workplaces came from the peripheral socialization. Chats over the
    coffee machine are a cliche, but they actually do make opportunities for colleagues
    to get more familiar. That’s why sloppy and haphazard face time hybrid work is
    entirely different from purposeful face time — having interactions for social
    purposes during these designated on sites can go a long way to developing strong
    networks.'

    and develop them into experienced practitioners in this new work world, so they
    default to trying to hire more senior people than their work really calls for.
    While this makes for more opportunities and demand for folks at my level, it’s
    not good for the field as a whole. We need to have new entrants to the discipline,
    bringing ideas and creativity, and we need to give them the tools to grow and
    succeed, even though we’re not in the same office all day the way we once were.

    makes our lives and our communities better. We just need to put forth the effort
    to identify what’s important, and figure out how we can achieve these goals in
    this new environment.
