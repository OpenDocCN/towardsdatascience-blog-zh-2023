    I have truly fallen in love with this programming language over all other programming
    languages. In some ways, this comes down to personal preference — multiple dispatch
    as a paradigm feels like an incredibly natural and intuitive way to program to
    me personally. However, there are also a host of advantages that utilizing this
    language for my projects has brought about. With these years of experience and
    overall enjoyment with the Julia programming language, I have learned an incredible
    amount. Not only about Julia, but also about multiple dispatch and even programming
    and programming languages more broadly. With this experience and education has
    also come some cumulative knowledge of smaller paradigm-shifting tricks that the
    Julia programming language has to offer. Julia is bringing all of this power to
    the Scientific domain, Data Science, as well as the broader programming community.
    Julia could very well end up becoming the Data Science language of the future!

    incredible flexible and capable programming paradigm. Not only that, but in my
    experience it is…
