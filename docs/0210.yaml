    closure plans in the past year. There have been many other retailers that have
    also closed stores during this time. Analysts estimate that we will see more than
    50,000 stores being shut down in the short term within the United States alone.
    Instead of relying on intuition and excel skills, adopting a data-driven and customer-centric
    approach can increase profitability for the store fleet.

    by profitability. Then, they start shutting down the least profitable ones assuming
    they can negotiate a swift exit from the lease since these weigh heavily on the
    balance sheet.

- en: Let me explain. When you close a store, your customer has a few options. They
    might go to a neighboring store within an acceptable distance of them; they might
    go to the competition; they may go to your online store; they may stop shopping
    the category altogether and save the money instead, or some combination of the
    above. These choices above focus on your existing customer base, which is about
    customer retention. With me so far? **Most store sales come from your existing
    customer base**, specifically your loyal shoppers, no doubt. The reality, though,
    is that a store is also central to a retailer’s or department store’s acquisition
    strategy, as they create awareness and work as a marketing vehicle. So, how do
    you factor this into the equation of a store closure?

- en: A catchment area is a geographic region from which a particular business receives
    its customers. Catchment areas are defined based on various factors such as distance,
    transportation access, and market demand. They are critical for real estate development,
    analysis, and business planning.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Ways Catchment Areas tend to be calculated: 1.) in an old-school way, people
    would draw a certain mile radius around a store, let’s say three miles, and everything
    within the circle would be considered part of the catchment area. Let’s not do
    that, please. 2.) The step up from the first approach would be to use the drive
    time to define a catchment area. So, for instance, with a 30min drive-time of
    your store, you consider that the catchment area.'

    purchased at the store in the past 12 or 24 months *(you need to be the judge
    on timeframe based on your business model)*, and map them to where they live,
    e.g., at census block group level. When you are done, you will discover that,
    most likely, the area will be massive, frequently covering the majority of the
    U.S. A way to narrow it down is by applying an optimization function, where you
    use a polygon and work to minimize the size of the area while keeping the cumulative
    percent of the total sales as large as possible. I’ve found that the cumulative
    sales capture in one of the optima generally is between 70 percent and 80 percent.
    Voilà, you now have custom catchment areas for all your stores.'

    and you also understand where else they purchase your products. This is the basis
    of the network. **Caution, though:** it most likely is essential to prune your
    networks to keep them contained; otherwise, they can mushroom quickly and cover
    all your stores. This is due to customers traveling for business or pleasure to
    other states and purchasing in a location they won’t be in outside of this trip.
    You can do this quite easily by establishing rules of minimum $ contribution to
    the store network.

    area that will not have any support from a brick-and-mortar perspective to help
    in your acquisition efforts. When you look at trends over time, you can get a
    sense of the relative importance to the overall chain and whether you should build
    a digitally supported strategy to offset the loss of acquiring new customers at
    a fraction of your cost of operating a retail location.'
