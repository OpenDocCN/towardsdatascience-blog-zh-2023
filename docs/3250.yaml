    gains. One study of the effect of ChatGPT on productivity in various writing and
    analysis tasks found that those who used ChatGPT spent 40% less time on the tasks
    than the control group that didn’t use ChatGPT. In addition, as per peer reviews,
    the quality of the solutions to the tasks were 18% higher [3].

    gain of 126% when using Co-Pilot to implement a Javascript server [5].

    study? And can we expect similar productivity gains across the board? For instance,
    is the task of implementing a Javascript server (the task that Co-pilot helped
    finish 124% faster) a representative task in software development? I don’t know
    as I’ve never done that task, but I’m quite sure the productivity gain will not
    be the same for all programming tasks. I expect productivity gains like the aforementioned
    can be gained when solving clear cut programming tasks that include writing a
    lot of boiler plate code, but for now I expect generative AI will only aid minimally
    – if at all – for tasks where you have to spend a lot of time contemplating the
    problem before you even know what questions to ask of generative AI. As such I
    expect the average productivity gain for programming tasks to be lower than 126%.

  prefs: []

    AI does not lead to any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it will be a net
    negative technology – a technology whose use emits more than it reduces. And due
    to climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, we’re supposed to reduce
    our global carbon footprint – not increase it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that it can save consumption in some places. For instance, it might reduce our
    need for searching Google and loading websites. But the question is what the carbon
    footprint of making one Google search and loading a web page is. That’s a complex
    question to answer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One number does float around the internet wrt the electricity consumption of
    making a single Google search, but as far as I know that number is from 2009\.
    Much has probably changed since, and I imagine Google searches today are powered
    by more sophisticated and more energy consuming machine learning methods. I do,
    however, expect Google searches to use less energy than a ChatGPT query, although
    I would venture the difference is less than the factor 10 stated some places [7].

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my discussions with people about the environmental impact of generative AI,
    I’ve heard some argue that the environmental impact will be worthwhile because
    they expect the technology will help reduce inequality. Whether we can expect
    that to be the case is not clear cut. Here’s why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The aforementioned study of ChatGPT’s effects on productivity [3] found that
    less skilled people had a larger productivity gain from using ChatGPT than more
    skilled people. We might therefore expect that access to generative AI can help
    lift people who are affected by structural inequality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there’s disparity between groups of workers in terms of how much generative
    AI will boost their productivity. Let’s use journalists and carpenters as examples.
    For journalists who write, the production of their primary output (articles) can
    be directly supported by generative AI. Generative AI won’t directly aid carpenters
    in building houses. So it seems that not all groups of workers will benefit equally
    from generative AI. If the productivity gains from using generative AI lead to
    higher wages, we might see increased inequality between groups of workers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    50 to 70% of the growth in US wage inequality between 1980 and 2016 was caused

    transition. It’s obvious that as white collar workers, researchers in green energy
    and related fields might become more productive as a result of using generative
    AI. Like others, they might write research articles or code faster. But for the
    foreseeable future, I personally don’t expect generative AI systems like ChatGPT
    to contribute directly to the green transition. I have a hard time picturing ChatGPT
    – a generalised text generation tool trained to come up with the next most probable
    word based on existing texts – coming up with a breakthrough idea. But I hope
    I’m wrong. Let me know if you have a different perspective.
