- en: What if we could encode every object image (human faces, etc) into a template
    — a vector of numbers? Thereafter, we could objectively determine the similarity
    between objects by numerically comparing — finding the distances — between their
    templates. In deep learning, this is exactly what the Siamese Neural Networks
    hope to achieve.

- en: The Siamese Neural Networks are basically models that, upon training, generate
    distinct feature vectors (templates) for each input object. Although these models
    are typically adopted in templating object images (Computer Vision) generally
    speaking, they may also be employed for text and sound data.

- en: Apart from security authentication, such as facial recognition and signature
    comparisons, Siamese Neural Networks are also commonly used in E-Commerce platforms
    to measure product similarity. For instance, some E-Commerce platforms allow you
    can search for similar products by uploading an image of an object you are looking
    for. On Kaggle, there is even a [Product Matching competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shopee-product-matching)
    by Shopee, a leading E-Commerce company in South-East Asia.
