    According to FindAMasters.com [1], universities around the world currently offer
    a total of more than 3,500 master’s degrees related to Data Science and AI.

    Hardly a day goes by where I’m not targeted by the internet gods with some slick,
    well-marketed college ad banging on about how “data is the new oil”.

    evaluate the pros and cons of enrolling. Obviously the universities are going
    to say it’s a good idea: they want your money! But is it a good idea? And is it
    a good idea for *you* specifically?'

    decision and consider all the important questions. I myself *do* have a master’s
    in Data Science, and while I think this was a worthwhile investment of time and
    money for me, I also believe that a master’s won’t be right for everyone. My hope
    is that these 8 considerations help you work out…
