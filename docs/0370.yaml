- en: One of my frustrations using the Decent Espresso Machine is the [water dispenser](https://medium.com/@rmckeon/water-distribution-for-espresso-cd361bc0734).
    It causes channeling to the left side for low flow, high temperature profiles,
    and this was particularly challenging for [staccato](/staccato-espresso-is-fundamentally-better-than-regular-espresso-e73e88337127)
    espresso. So I set out to improve my profile so I could once again pull a staccato
    shot.

- en: My theory with steam is that the steam pushes solubles down towards the bottom
    of the puck. So when water at the top of the puck drains, there just isn’t many
    solubles in that water. The solubles get stuck further down in the puck due to
    the steam. This is why multiple pump and dumps don’t remove solubles from the
    coffee into the waste water.

- en: I am fully aware that this profile seems crazy especially because it is so different
    from a typical 9 bar shot. This profile didn’t even hit 2 bars in pressure, but
    the extraction efficiency is just madness. This profile gives me hope that I can
    get to the performance of the [Kim Express](/designing-the-double-double-sudo-staccato-espresso-shot-5c435c292672)
    and beyond.
