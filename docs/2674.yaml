    fascination and fear. On one hand in just two months, with 100 millions monthly
    active users, the app broke the record for the fastest-growing consumer application
    in history. On the other hand, a report by Goldman Sachs claimed that such technology
    could replace more than 300 millions jobs globally [1]. Additionally, Elon Musk
    alongside more than 1,000 tech leaders and researchers signed an open letter urging
    for a pause on the most advanced AI developments [2].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The world changed with the birth of ChatGPT. At least, as someone who codes
    every day, my world changed overnight. Instead of spending hours on Google to
    find the right solution or digging into the answers on Stack Overflow and translating
    the solution to my exact problem with the right variables names and matrices dimensions,
    I could just ask ChatGPT. The chatbot would not only give me an answer in a blink
    of an eye but the answer would fit my exact situation (e.g. correct names, dataframes
    dimensions, variable types, etc.). I was blown away, and my productivity jumped
    suddenly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, I decided to explore the large-scale effect of ChatGPT release and its
    potential effect on productivity and ultimately on the way we work. I defined
    three hypotheses (Hs) that I tested using Stack Overflow data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**H1: ChatGPT decreases the number of questions asked on Stack Overflow.**
    If ChatGPT can solve coding problems in seconds, we can expect a fall of questions
    on coding community platforms where asking a question and getting an answer takes
    time.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**H2: ChatGPT increases the quality of the questions asked.** If ChatGPT is
    used largely, the remaining questions on Stack Overflow must be better documented
    as ChatGPT might have already helped a bit.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**H3: The remaining questions are more complex.** We can expect that the remaining
    questions are more challenging as they could potentially not be answered by ChatGPT.
    Hence, to test this we are testing if the proportion of unanswered questions increases.
    In addition, I also test if the number of views per question changes. If the number
    of views per question is stable it would be an additional sign that the complexity
    of the remaining questions is increased and that this finding is not only caused
    by the reduced activity on the platform.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To test those hypotheses, I will exploit the sudden release of ChatGPT on Stack
    Overflow. In November 2022, when OpenAI released publicly their chatbot, no other
    alternatives were available (e.g. Google Bard), and the access was free (not limited
    to paid subscription as with OpenAI ChatGPT 4 or Code Interpreter). Hence it is
    possible to observe how the activity changed in the online coding community before
    and after the shock. However, despite how ‘clean’ this shock is, other effects
    might be confounded and hence question causality. In particular, seasonality (e.g.
    end of the year holidays after the release) as well as the fact that the more
    recent the question is, the lower the number of views and the probability that
    an answer is found.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, to mitigate the influence of potential lingering confounding variables
    such as seasonality and measure a causal effect, we would like to observe the
    world without ChatGPT release which is impossible (e.g. the fundamental problem
    of causal inference). Nevertheless, I will address this challenge by exploiting
    the fact that the quality of the answers of ChatGPT for coding-related issues
    varies from one language to another and use quasi-experimental methods to limit
    the risk of other factors confounding the effect (Difference-in-Difference).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do so, I will compare the activity on Stack Overflow between Python and R.
    Python is an obvious choice as it, is arguably, one of the
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most popular programming languages used (e.g. ranked 1st in the TIOBE
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Programming Community Index). The large set of resources online for Python provides
    a rich training set for chatbots like ChatGPT. Now, to compare with Python, I
    chose R. Python is often cited as the best replacement for R and both are freely
    available. However, R is somewhat less popular (e.g.~16th in the TIOBE Programming
    Community index) and hence the training data might be smaller, implying poorer
    performance by ChatGPT. Anecdotal evidence confirmed this difference (more details
    on the method in the Method section). Hence, R represents a valid counter factual
    for Python (it is affected by seasonality but we can expect a negligible effect
    of ChatGPT).

    Python on Stack Overflow. The subsequent analysis, utilizing the Diff-in-Diff
    method, further unveils an improvement in question quality (measured on the platform
    by a score), alongside an increase in the proportion of questions remaining unanswered
    (while the average number of views per question seems unchanged). Consequently,
    this study provides evidence for the three hypotheses defined earlier.'

    of the model is to compute a double difference, in order to check how the first
    difference for the treated (Python) is different from the second (difference for
    the control group, R). As we expect no treatment effect (or negligible) on the
