    limits. Data scientists are a significant investment for any organization. Unfortunately,
    inefficiencies like idle infrastructure can waste significant amounts of data
    infrastructure investments. Agile methodologies offer a solution, improving workflow
    and cutting down on wasted time. With agile, the traditional data science process
    becomes optimized and adaptable, delivering value more efficiently. This article
    explores these hidden costs and demonstrates how agile practices can make your
    data science initiatives more cost-effective.

    are a valuable resource, and their productivity is paramount. The less time data
    scientists spend on innovation and more on tedious tasks, the greater the expense
    without the payoff. In addition, the tendency for data scientists to work on their
    own machines as not to be restricted by central IT or to stand up parallel “shadow
    IT” capacity makes knowledge discovery burdensome and often leads to reinventing
    the wheel scenarios.

    of models make it to production, and a significant portions of a data scientist’s
    time per day can be wasted on menial tasks like IT setup. Additionally, when data
    scientists are hard at work, infrastructure costs add up quickly. When they’re
    toiling away and distracted from innovation, data infrastructure investments can
    actually become idle, always-on, and over-provisioned. Finally, moving data into
    and out of the cloud also get expensive at AI data scales. As a result, cloud
    costs become difficult to manage across multiple stacks, silos, and environments.

    of cloud compute and expensive GPUs. In 2023, prominent models like ChatGPT cost
    organizations like OpenAI around $700,000 per day in computing costs (SemiAnalysis
    in the Washington Post [1]). By one [estimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A&t=109s),
    ChatGPT required 1000’s of GPUs and months of training before it was ever deployed

    data science projects properly (BCG). For example, data spread across multiple
    cloud platforms not only inflates storage costs but also makes it difficult to
    access and share data across teams. This fractured approach can further strain
    budgets, and undermine the collaboration and efficiency that is essential in the
    data science lifecycle. How can we transform these stumbling blocks into stepping
    stones? The answer may lie in embracing agile methodologies and a structured process
    design.

    The complexities involved in setting up and managing data science environments
    can lead to substantial hidden costs, particularly when resources are underutilized.

    in potential productivity and an efficiency bottleneck as resources are poorly
    allocated for use by multiple teams. Sadly, this form of waste isn’t always apparent
    and often requires meticulous tracking and management to detect and mitigate.
    Leveraging agile strategies can unlock more significant value from data science
    investments, turning potential waste into productivity and innovation. It also
    creates a paper trail for monitoring costs, resource utilization, and ultimately

    According to industry reports, only 56% of data science projects ever exceed the
    experimental stage to deliver business value. One significant factor is the ballooning
    costs associated with data storage and management, but also costs from a variety
    of hardware and software solutions. However, adopting agile practices can serve
    as a lifeboat in this rising tide of expenses.
  prefs: []

    allows data science teams to pinpoint storage inefficiencies. For example, redundant
    data sets that can often be avoided through iterative sprints that focus on data
    consolidation. By incrementally building on previous work and reusing data and
    code, an agile workflow minimizes the need for additional storage resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, agile practices like version control and feature branching enable
    efficient data management. Proper versioning makes it easier to roll back to previous
    states of the project, negating the need for multiple redundant copies and adding
    to storage savings.
  prefs: []

    boards, teams gain a transparent view of who is doing what, leading to more informed
    resource distribution, and optimal utilization of both human and machine resources,
    less idle time, and consequently, idle costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The agile mindset also extends to automation. Iterative development of automated
    pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can remove manual
    chokepoints one sprint at a time — accelerating the scaling process and significantly
    lowering costs related to manual labor and error rectification.

    Teams must be adaptive, willing to incorporate feedback, and make necessary pivots.
    Data science projects are multifaceted and complex; therefore, rigid adherence
    to any one methodology may introduce operational blind spots and unexpected costs.

    Without it, not only do costs spiral, but the time-to-value also increases, negating
    the competitive advantage of adopting data science in the first place. One often
    overlooked factor that plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency is the role
    of IT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    infrastructure, the rise of data science expands their role. They are now instrumental
    in establishing automated workflows and driving the adoption of agile practices,
    which has a direct impact on cost efficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One actionable way to drive efficiency is by mapping Epics, or large chunks
    of work, to smaller Projects (or the equivalent unit of work supported by your
    data science platform), and Tasks/Stories to Projects, a practice often supported
    by agile methodologies. This integration serves as a lighthouse, guiding teams
    through the complexities of data science projects. Each Epic can be broken down
    into multiple smaller tasks or stories, helping in project scoping and role allocation.
    This fosters not just transparency but also accountability, thus driving efficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automated pipelines and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
    mechanisms, often overseen by IT, further enhance this efficiency. Automation
    expedites routine tasks, freeing up hours of data scientists’ time for more complex
    tasks and innovation. This is where IT’s role is indispensable. IT can set up
    these pipelines and maintain them, ensuring that the data science teams have all
    they need to work efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another facet of this is managing cloud resources and computing power. Machine
    learning models require intense computation, which is both time-consuming and
    costly. Here, IT can allocate resources judiciously, based on the agile plan and
    current sprint tasks. This avoids the waste of computational power, ensuring that
    only the required amount of resources are utilized, thereby cutting costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a nutshell, the role of IT is evolving to become an enabler in implementing
    agile practices in data science, which in turn is crucial for controlling costs
    and enhancing efficiency. By enabling agile practices and automation across data
    science teams, IT stands as a pillar supporting the agile framework in data science.
