- en: It has been quite sometime since I’ve written an update on the state of deep
    learning for time series. Several conferences have come and gone and the field
    as a whole has advanced in several different ways. Here I will attempt to cover
    some of the more promising as well as critical papers that have come out in the
    last year or so as well as updates to the [Flow Forecast](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast)
    framework [FF].

- en: Over the last year we have made major strides in the architecture and documentation
    of FF. Just recently we rolled out full support for time series classification
    and supervised anomaly detection. Additionally, we have added several more [tutorial
    notebooks](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow_tutorials) and expanded our
    unit-test coverage to more than 77%.
