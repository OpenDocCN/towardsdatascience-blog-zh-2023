    remaining before an event occurs is even better!

- en: Take the example of customer churn. What if, instead of predicting the probability
    of a customer leaving the company in the next months, you could predict this probability
    at several time points over the next months? The benefits of such an approach
    are immediate. It would allow you to anticipate and prioritize your marketing
    actions more effectively in time and, ultimately, reduce the churn rate.

    analysis. It refers to a learning framework and a set of techniques that can be
    used to estimate the time it takes for an event of interest to occur based on
    observations.

- en: 'The name of survival analysis comes from the typical use case where it was
    first applied: predicting time to death for clinical research. However, one should
    not be misled by its name: it is not limited to the medical field, but can be
    applied to use cases in multiple industries. And with the recent advances in data
    science, survival analysis has reemerged leaving the world of classical statistics
    to…'
