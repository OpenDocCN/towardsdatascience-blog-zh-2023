    I wrote it mainly to vent my pent-up frustrations as a data analyst, and yes,
    also to take on the most popular data tool at the time: the dashboard.'

    alone, and over 250,000 as of writing this. Something in the now-infamous article
    clearly resonated with others (or just really pissed them off). Over the last
    three years, I’ve attempted to write various follow-up articles but have shied
    away at the last moment, not sure exactly what I wanted to say.

    think of. Of course, they couldn’t do all of that.'

    data team can now choose between reverse ETL, BI notebooks, data canvases, self-service
    solutions, and embedded analytics. It has been exciting to see these new options
    appear, as each one slightly changes how we approach the problem at hand — which
    is exactly the point…

    are Dead” has a lot less to do with dashboards than, well, everything around them.
    In the end, the root of my discontent was the relationships, communication, processes,
    and people. But it’s much simpler to blame the tool that was jammed in to solve
    all of those problems at once.
  prefs: []

    more difficult than adopting new tools. It requires us to fundamentally think

    data translators, and trusted advisors to the business. They are finally getting

    I’ve met too many data analysts over the last 5 years that were so cynical, and
    so let down by their time as an analyst that they were giving up their data careers
    entirely. Here, at least is one people problem that is getting much-needed attention.
    If I’m being really optimistic (which I am known for), then I think we might see
    an [analyst renaissance](https://blog.count.co/what-will-analyst-2-0-look-like/)
