    — this is a piece of software which scrapes content from all websites across the
    internet, which is then used for AI model training. The existence of the crawler
    is not surprising and several legitimate web crawlers exist today, including Google’s
    crawler that indexes the entire internet. However, this is the first time OpenAI
    explicitly announced its existence and also provided a mechanism for websites
    to opt out of being scraped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the crawler is **opt in by default**, i.e. you need to explicitly
    change a piece of code on your website to ask the crawler not to scrape your data.
    Opt in / out defaults are sticky and often determine what the majority behavior
    is, because most people don’t take the effort to change defaults. It is the same
    reason why [Apple’s iOS14 privacy changes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency)
    have had a major impact on the digital advertising industry.
