- en: Year after year, datasets get bigger, cloud servers run faster, and analytics
    tools become more sophisticated. Despite this constant progress, however, practitioners
    continue to run into the issue of bias—whether it’s lurking in the dark recesses
    of their data files, popping up in their models’ outputs, or framing their project’s
    root assumptions.

- en: A definitive solution to bias will require a lot more than local changes to
    a data team’s workflows; it’s not realistic to expect tactical fixes to solve
    a deep-rooted systemic problem. There’s hope, however, in the growing recognition
    (in tech and beyond) that this is, indeed, a problem to think about, discuss,
    and tackle collectively.

    For anyone who’s exploring this topic for the first time, [Shahrokh Barati](https://medium.com/u/67c421235d57?source=post_page-----e0982fd7416c--------------------------------)’s
    primer is an essential read on the differences between statistical bias and ethical
    bias: “two different categories of bias with distinct root causes and mitigations,”
    that can each jeopardize data projects (and harm end users) if left unaddressed.'

    After ML models go into production, they continue to evolve as teams fine-tune
    them to optimize their performance. Every tweak is a potential opening for bias
    to sneak in — which is why [Jazmia Henry](https://medium.com/u/23c2e80e732a?source=post_page-----e0982fd7416c--------------------------------)
    advocates for the adoption of model versioning, an approach that “allows for model
    rollbacks that can save your company money long term, but more importantly, help
    reduce bias if and when it arises.”'

    transparency of the people who train and design these powerful models.'

    When we think of a field where data science and ML can make a major impact, healthcare
    is a common example, with many real-world applications already in use (or getting
    close). As [Stefany Goradia](https://medium.com/u/36e97dd8343d?source=post_page-----e0982fd7416c--------------------------------)
    shows, though, the datasets that health data scientists rely on can be rife with
    numerous forms of bias, which is why it’s crucial they know how to identify them
    correctly.'
