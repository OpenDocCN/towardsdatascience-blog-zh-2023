- en: The vast majority of my career has been spent in the field of data analysis.
    Early on, my work was of a much more technical nature as I focused on the designing
    and building of data warehouses. As time went on my work became less technical
    as I gravitated towards the business side of analysis and eventually into data
    analysis managerial roles. This career path has given me a unique perspective
    (and appreciation) of the role of the data analyst within a business organization.
    I wrote this piece to provide my perspective to anyone who is either looking at
    data analysis as a career or who is currently a data analyst seeking to advance
    their career. While there is ample instructional material devoted to the technical
    aspects of becoming a data analyst, I have yet to see anything meaningful published
    from the perspective of a hiring manager. My hope is that your reading of this
    will help you in your journey to becoming a highly sought-after data analyst.

    volume of data in the digital universe increased 15-fold, [from 6.5 zettabytes
    (ZB) to 97 ZB and it is estimated that within the next three years (by the end
    of 2025) that number will nearly double to 181 ZB](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/)!
    Translating that into more relatable terms, one zettabyte equals one TRILLION
    gigabytes of data. As digital transformations and the internet of things (**IoT**)
    continue to proliferate, the volume and spectrum of data collected will only continue
    to grow. This explosion in data has been made possible by revolutionary advancements
    in the Big Data construct that enables all of this data to be captured, wrangled,
    stored, processed and analyzed in near real-time. However, as the volume of data
    we produce continues, the business insights that we have been able to glean from
    it have not. In fact, the gap between data gathered versus insights gathered has
    only continued to grow despite the billions of dollars being spent each year on
    efforts to close it. One of the primary reasons that this gap exists is the shortage
    of qualified talent to do the work.

- en: When I started my data analysis career in the early 2000s, data warehouses were
    all the rage. My technical toolbox included a relational database, a database
    design tool (Erwin), an extraction transformation load (ETL) tool, a business
    intelligence (BI) tool and of course, structured query language (SQL). It was
    an intuitive set of tools, with a relatively easy learning curve. But in today’s
    data analysis environment, given the sheer volume of data now stored in a multitude
    of different forms and levels of structure, a plethora of skill sets and roles
    are required to perform analysis. It has even given rise to the highly coveted,
    multi-skilled role of the data scientist.

    analyst choose which one(s) to learn? While choosing what to learn is not the
    specific focus of this article, what I will tell you is that you should be spending
    the finite amount of time you have **mastering** the ones that you have chosen.
    The first half of the old saying “a jack of all trades is the master of none”,
    fully applies here. In my experience as a hiring manager, many who are new to
    the data analysis workforce, tend to present a laundry list of technical skills
    that they have fair to rudimentary knowledge of in the hopes that it might give
    them an edge. This is a mistake.
  prefs: []

- en: What matters to me is that you can demonstrate the ability to use the skills
    you have learned in a real-world application. For example, if you have spent your
    time learning how to program in R (the statistical language), I would want to
    hear about how you deployed it to answer real-world questions versus just being
    able to recite a list of functions you could call. Describe the question you were
    seeking to answer from a business perspective and then what functionalities of
    the tool you used to answer it. Being able to do this will demonstrate two things
    to me. First, that you possess the technical skill and second (and much more importantly),
    that you understand how to use it within the context of a business.

- en: As a side note, many data analysts possess outstanding technical skill sets
    but still cannot apply them without detailed guidance from the business. On the
    other hand, if you can demonstrate that you have mastered a particular technical
    skill in the manner that I have described, I will then have the confidence that
    you will be able to master and correctly apply other valuable technical skills
    after I hire you.

    is curiosity***. For data analysts, that curiosity is demonstrated to me by their
    ability to show a true understanding of the business that they are supporting.
    At a high level, can you tell me what the company does, and how it makes money?
    What challenges does it have? The more you can tell me the better. And then, at
    a more detailed level, how did the analysis you perform help the company? For
    example, if your company was experiencing extreme delays in the shipping of their
    products and you were tasked with finding the cause, what was your approach to
    analyzing this issue? Can you describe to me, in detail, what the actual shipping
    process was? And then, based on your understanding of that process, how you structured
    your analysis and identified the issue? If you could, I can guarantee you it would
    set you apart from the majority of data analyst candidates. ***The best data analysts
    possess a thorough understanding of the business operation that they support.***

    you to take the same approach as you are learning technical skills. Don’t just
    learn how to code or use analytic software by rote, it will be wasted time for
    a number of reasons. There are plenty of publicly available data sets you can
    use to create your own data analysis scenarios. I encourage you to take this approach
    for two reasons. The first of course is to learn a technical skill. The second
    (and perhaps more important), is to find out if this is work that you have an
    aptitude for and might actually enjoy. Becoming a data analyst is a huge commitment.
    Take this as an opportunity to sample this role in advance so you can determine
    whether or not it is a career path that you truly want to pursue.

    ***I always made it a goal to try and understand the business that I was supporting
    as well as they did***. I found that by doing this, I became an incredibly effective
    data analyst which in turn made me an invaluable team member. It also made my
    job much more rewarding as I could see, first-hand, the value that I was adding.
    I cannot emphasize enough how pivotal taking this approach was to my career. If
    there is one thing that I could have you take away from this reading, this would
    be it.

    speed as more and more companies recognize the veritable pot of gold that the
    ability to gather insights from all of this data represents. AI, ML, the Cloud,
    Hadoop clusters, Apache Spark, data lakes, data pipelines, data fabric, data mesh,
    data visualization, the list goes on and on as new technologies, architectures
    and analytic approaches continue to come online. Being proficient in all of these
    is clearly impossible, but I would strongly encourage you to develop a conceptual
    understanding of their function and what role they play in the overall data analysis
    picture. I can almost guarantee you that there will come a time when you realize
    a great opportunity by developing a new skill in one of them. Also, keep abreast
    of the top trends in data and analytics. The highly respected Gartner does a brilliant
    job of documenting this annually with their “[Top Trends in Data & Analytics](https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/430318/1035298)”.
    Building and maintaining this knowledge base will help with your overall understanding
    of the many different aspects of data analysis as well as keep you relevant in
    an ever-evolving field. Remember, stay curious!

    of my career, I have taken note of the things that I wish I had known when I first
    started as a data analyst. That list has grown, shrunk, evolved and crystalized
    over the years. With the recent explosion in data and data analysis, my urgency
    in sharing my thoughts increased as I can only imagine myself being overwhelmed
    with the complexities of becoming a data analyst in today’s environment. I thank
    you for taking the time to read this and I genuinely hope that you have found
    some value in it. I wish you all the best in whatever career path you ultimately
    choose.
