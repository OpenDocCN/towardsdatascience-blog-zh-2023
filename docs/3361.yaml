    to Do About It**](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280)”,
    Michael E. Gerber invites small business owners to stop working “in their business”,
    and start working on their business. One of the central thesis of the book is
    that SMB owners should act as if they wanted to franchise their business. This
    forces them to (1) take a hard look at all their activities and processes and
    (2) optimize and standardize those activities and processes. By doing so, they
    will maximise the yield of their business, and make it replicable. This idea is
    similar to something that was expressed by Ray Dahlio in “[**Principles**](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Ray-Dalio-audiobook/dp/B074B2CZJG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=B5W2ZRYM6O1Z&keywords=principles+by+ray+dalio&qid=1698990013&s=books&sprefix=Principles%2Cstripbooks%2C162&sr=1-1)”
    — in order for a team to be successful, their manager needs to work on the team
    (and not in the team), and build a system that will maximize the yield of any
    given input.'

    an analytics team — schematically — the input is the time spent on turning data

    the two can be represented as follow:'

- en: The time spent on turning data into insights is very clearly a function of your
    total headcount — so increasing headcount is the obvious solution, but that might
    not be the easiest one .
  prefs: []

    is the result of the following equation:'

    on non-data work**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The time spent on non-data work includes elements like “alignment with stakeholders”,
    “communication”, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These tasks are essential to the success of any good data work (what’s the point
    of generating insights if there is no interest in them, or if you don’t properly
    communicate them?).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But these tasks are usually treated as “afterthoughts”. It is pretty rare to
    see a team with a clear strategy or process on those elements — most likely because
    this is not as “cool” as the real data work, and also because this is not necessarily
    part of their skillset.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This results in these tasks taking more time than expected and more time than
    it needs to be to ensure the success of the actual data work it supports.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By (1) defining clear processes on how to go about these tasks, and (2) by standardizing
    and optimizing these processes over time, you can drive a lot of time savings
    (i.e. reducing the time spent on the non-data work), and improve the quality of
    your output at the same time.
  prefs: []

- en: A concrete example of this around cross-functional alignment could be to start
    running prioritization sessions at the beginning of every month. In the first
    month of doing this, you realize that in order to have a good prioritization session
    you need to have a standard framework to make prioritization decisions. You introduce
    that in Month 2 and it works, but then you realize that to make it even better,
    you need to have a better process to map the potential projects for the team,
    so you introduce that in Month 3, etc. Overtime, with this iterative approach,
    you can get to a very effective process, allowing your team to spend less time
    on “political work” and to focus more on insight creation.

- en: 'Another example around company-wide communication: you start without a clear
    process in Month 1 and realize that your study is not being consumed as much as
    it should have been. So in Month 2, you launch a monthly forum. During those monthly
    forums, you realize your stakeholders need to see the data presented in a certain
    way so it is more digestible for them so you adopt a certain format / template,
    etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again — by optimizing those processes, not only you save time that you can re-invest
    in insights creation, but you also set yourself up for success, as those time-consuming
    non-data related processes support your team’s ability to generate quality insights.

- en: Upskilling your analysts to cut the time it takes them to turn data into quality
    insights is the first strategy. The higher the skills, the more experience they
    have, the faster they can be in turning data into quality insights. While team-level
    training or individual coaching can generally create a lot of value, a “soft”
    way to upskill is by creating project “templates” so that more junior analysts
    can adopt best practices and learn quickly. For example, having templates can
    force them to think about key questions such as “what is the pain point”, “how
    will your results be used in real life”, etc. that ultimately will help them build
    stronger problem statements prior to them starting their study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating ways for the team to collaborate and share their knowledge can also
    be a way to reduce the time to insight. It can be as easy as creating slack channels
    or google groups and finding some incentive for people to participate — but those
    tiny actions can go a long way. Once those “venues” exist, analysts can find support
    when they are not sure how to proceed, utilize the collective knowledge of the
    team and create discussion that inspires new ideas. That’s also why I believe
    it is great to have recurring meetings where analysts can present what they worked
    on — with a focus on the methodology they used, as it spreads knowledge and can
    give ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The availability of data can be a big blocker. If you have to spend your time
    making complicated queries because there are no simple aggregated databases that
    exist, and if you have to triple-check your results every time because there is
    no certified or centralized data source, not only that will create unnecessary
    stress for the team, but you will lose precious time. Creating the right data
    pipelines to make downstream analysis easier can be an effective strategy — if
    this hasn’t already been done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, if you have to do the same analysis quite often, the existence of
    tools can be a way to reduce the time you spend doing repetitive work. This is
    quite common for things like A/B testing, where you can build / buy licenses for
    automated tools to do all the statistical tests for you, so that you don’t have
    to reinvent the wheel every time you get some data from an experiment. It requires
    having a specific, repeated use case but when that’s the case, that can be a great
    way to reduce the time to insight (and bonus point: this is also a great way to
    standardize the quality of the output).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, you have a few ways to go about reducing the average time to insights
    — and I think I am pretty far from being comprehensive. You can also think about
    knowledge management, data discoverability, etc — it all depends on what are the
    main pain points that your team is facing.
