    probably have a solid idea of the core skills you’ll need to get a foot in the
    door: some statistics, working knowledge of a programming language (or two), and
    a reasonable grasp of how to process, analyze, and visualize data, to name a few
    obvious ones.'

    long run, though? That’s where things often get murkier — and where this week’s
    highlights come in handy. We’ve selected a handful of articles by data professionals
    who share actionable insights based on their own experiences and non-linear career
    paths. They may focus on specific domains and roles, but the lessons they offer
    are applicable to many other real-world situations. Let’s dive in.

    binary, but it’s undeniable that those we tend to categorize as “soft” are among
    the most essential for finding success in a data-focused career. [Eirik Berge](https://medium.com/u/7722f981eb?source=post_page-----cc170390a144--------------------------------)
