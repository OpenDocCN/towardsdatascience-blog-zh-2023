- en: The problem of 3D reconstruction aims to produce a high-resolution object representation
    given a noisy view of the object (e.g., partial point cloud, 2D image, etc.) as
    input. Recently, deep neural networks have become a popular approach for 3D reconstruction,
    as they can encode prior information that helps to handle ambiguity. Put simply,
    this means that if the correct way to reconstruct a given object is unclear from
    the input, *a neural network can draw from its experience with other data points
    that it has seen during training to still produce a reasonable output*.

- en: Most 3D reconstruction approaches were originally limited in their ability to
    represent high-resolution objects. Voxels, point clouds, and meshes all fell short
    of modeling high-resolution objects in a memory efficient manner. Compared to
    models like GANs [2] that could generate high-resolution, realistic images, comparable
    approaches for generating 3D geometries were primitive.
