    supervised machine learning models and making predictions. However, using small
    amounts of data and simple, yet foundational, mathematical models in R, we can
    generate large insights that can inform policy to alleviate infectious disease
    threats. These types of models are often overlooked in the data science community
    but are an equally important tool for generating insight.

- en: One of the most prominent diseases ravaging deer and elk populations today is
    call Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). CWD is a “transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
    or prion disease”, similar to mad cow disease, that “affects deer, elk, reindeer,
    sika deer and moose” [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11974617/), [2](https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/index.html)].
    The disease is found in free-range deer populations and can be spread through
    “direct contact via body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine or indirect
    contact via environmental contamination of soil, food or water” [2]. Currently,
    it does not affect humans, but keeping CWD-infected animals out of the food supply
    chain is an important goal of health security. Modeling the spread of the disease
    is important to understanding how CWD incidence might increase in the future.
    With some of the simple modeling tools I described in my [previous blog post](https://medium.com/dev-genius/a-quick-intro-to-infectious-disease-modeling-in-r-for-beginners-5f4dbdf68e9e),
    we can build an SEIR model in R of CWD using data collected on white tail deer
    populations in Wisconsin.

    SEIR stands for Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered/Removed, and these disease
    states will form the basis for our compartmental model. In general, the susceptible
    state will include all deer not yet infected with CWD but who could be infected.
    There will be movement in and out of the susceptible state via births into the
    model, deaths out of the model, and infections. The exposed state of the model
    will include the population of deer that are infected with CWD but not yet infectious.
    Deer enter this stage after exposure to CWD until the [latent period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_period_(epidemiology))
    (time between becoming infected and becoming infectious) has passed. The infectious
    state is absorbing. That is to say, the only way out is through death. Now, let’s
    describe the SEIR model mathematically:'

    minimize the number of parameters we calibrate. Many different parameter sets
    can achieve near identical fits to the data, and no parameter set will fit perfectly.

    of our model. For example, the life expectancy of a deer is about 4.5 years [[3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3803059?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents)],
    CWD has a latent period of about 15 months [1], and CWD increases mortality rate
    by about 4.5 times that of a healthy deer [[4](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/wildlife_pdf/cwdfactsheet.pdf)].
    In addition, the state of Wisconsin publishes data on hunting harvests [[5](https://dnr.wi.gov/wideermetrics/DeerStats.aspx)],
    which will inform our death rate, and on the number of hunting days [[9](https://dnr.wi.gov/wideermetrics/DeerStats.aspx?R=HunterSurvey)].
    The data on incidence of CWD (from 1999–2019) we will use in the model comes directly
    from test results published by the state of Wisconsin and can be found here: [Summary
    of CWD Statewide Surveillance](https://dnr.wi.gov/wmcwd/Summary/Zone) [8]. In
    the period for which we have data, about 99% of reported CWD cases occurred in
    the Southern Farmland Zone of Wisconsin, so we will limit our model population
    to that zone.'

    library. Here, we define our model as a function. Notice that we explicitly account

    and infectious (beta_CWD_Deer) CWD.

    there are many different parameter sets that will generate a good-fitting model.
    Our job now is to estimate the transmission rate of CWD that best fits the incidence
    data from Wisconsin given that we will hold all other parameters constant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many different ways to calibrate a model, as parameter values have
    an infinite range of possibilities. For the transmission rate of CWD, the possible
    value of the transmission rate of CWD can range from 0 to positive infinity. In
    this case, I did some initial exploration that led me to believe the value of
    beta_CWD_Deer would be somewhere between 0.01 and 0.5\. In this case, I will test
    all values between 0.01 and 0.5 in increments of 0.001\. This is the simplest
    approach one could take, but when our focus is policy or simplicity, it will do
    just fine. We will look for the value of beta_CWD_Deer which will minimize the
    mean squared error between the number of cases recorded each year in the data
    and the number of cases reported each year by the model.

    scenario 3 results in a long-term prevalence of about 20.2%. In reality, there

    the spread of CWD in the whitetail deer population in southern Wisconsin using
    the SEIR model. Such models are especially useful at informing policy when combined
    with subject matter expertise. While not as accurate or as novel as AI methods,
    mathematical models perform astoundingly well with very small amounts of data.
