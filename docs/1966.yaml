    they represent 62% of all deaths caused by breast cancer. Survival of breast cancer
    for at least 5 years after diagnosis ranges from more than [90% in high-income

    (a medical term meaning spread to other sites in the body). This step is not only
    sensitive, time intensive and laborious but also requires highly-skilled medical
