- en: '*Before we get started, I would like to position this article as one of several
    recent articles that sit at the intersection between data science and marathon
    running. In previous articles, I have focused on several technical challenges
    related to* [*visualising marathon training*](/improving-the-strava-training-log-4d2039c49ec4)
    *and* [*performance data*](/how-to-create-a-heat-line-plot-82f8038d1659)*. Here
    I shift focus to analyse (my own) recent marathon performances using some of the
    visualisation techniques discussed previously along with several performance metrics
    from the sports science domain. As such, this article provides a concrete example
    of my own explorative data science process, showing how relatively simple concepts
    such as (running) speed and effort can be used to explore more sophisticated contemporary
    physiological measures such as resilience and durability in order to better understand
    performance in the marathon. At the same time, it is worth noting that similar
    ideas are proving to be relevant in many other endurance domains such as cycling,
    triathlon, skating etc.*'

- en: I came to running late in life. I started in my 40s. I have been able to complete
    the Dublin City Marathon (DCM) 8 times now — beginning in 2013 — and I have been
    fortunate to achieve several new *personal bests* (*PBs*) along the way, even
    as I have gotten older. My most recent effort this year (2023)…
