- en: In causal inference, we are usually interested in estimating the causal effect
    of a treatment (a drug, ad, product, …) on an outcome of interest (a disease,
    firm revenue, customer satisfaction, …). However, knowing that a treatment works
    on average is often not sufficient and we would like to know for which subjects
    (patients, users, customers, …) it works better or worse, i.e. we would like to
    estimate **heterogeneous treatment effects**.

    and more efficiently through **targeting**. Knowing which customers are more likely
    to react to a discount allows a company to spend less money by offering fewer
    but better-targeted discounts. This works also for negative effects: knowing for
    which patients a certain drug has side effects allows a pharmaceutical company
    to warn or exclude them from the treatment. There is also a more subtle advantage
    of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects: knowing **for whom** a treatment
    works allow us to better understand **how** a treatment works. Knowing that the
    effect of a discount does not depend on the income of its recipient but rather
    on its buying habits tells us that maybe it is not a matter…'
