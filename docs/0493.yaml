- en: This happened to me while I was running my TensorFlow BERT model on my Jupyter
    Notebook. Training large language models (LLMs) notoriously takes a large amount
    of data and compute, so it could make sense for my comparably puny laptop to crash
    here‚Ä¶

    was strange given my assumption that more memory was used during training than
    prediction.

    debugging line-by-line through the TensorFlow sounded like a daunting exercise.

    gather more context. From a [few other threads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39328658/how-to-debug-dying-jupyter-python3-kernel),
    it seemed clear that the reason for the kernel dying was the my model prediction
    required more RAM than my CPU‚Ä¶
