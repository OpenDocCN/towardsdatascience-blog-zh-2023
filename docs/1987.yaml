    days, I am pleased to say I’m pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence this
    Fall 2023\. I thought I would put together this blog to share all the valuable
    lessons I learned and experiences I encountered along the way that made all this
    possible.

- en: A bit of a background about me, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Robotics
    and Automation at a top private school in India. The school ranks [63rd](https://www.nirfindia.org/2023/EngineeringRanking.html)
    nationwide and top 10 (out of ~500 universities) in the state. I took up coursework
    on Machine Learning and AI for Robotics, which sparked my interest in this field.
    While my time there shaped my academic success, I often wondered why I hadn’t
    considered the path of research at that point. I have come across fortunate individuals
    who discovered their passion for research during undergrad, and actively engaged
    with professors, collaborating on works for peer-reviewed journals or conference
    proceedings. It’s evident how publishing early on can be a game-changer, and I’ve
    witnessed how it has positively shaped the profiles of others in the field.

- en: After my undergrad, I went on to work as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) at
    a startup. Although my time there was relatively short, I gained valuable experience
    working with a popular deep-learning framework — TensorFlow. I contributed to
    a project focused on the quantization of neural networks during the stages of
    training, evaluation, and inference. Through this process, I learned how to construct
    neural network architectures, modify graph layers, and create kernels from the
    ground up, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying
    source code of TensorFlow. Working on projects (even personal projects) or roles
    like these will develop a strong sense of foundation of deep learning optimization
    techniques and enhance your thinking capability as a researcher. It will also
    provide the confidence to not only be the end user of a pre-trained algorithm
    but design custom or specific neural network models to suit your research objectives.

    fine!), I personally saw the value in collaborating and gaining hands-on experience
    that gave me an edge when continuing to pursue my graduate studies. This process
    taught me how to effectively collaborate with teammates, how to drive projects
    from conception to completion, and how to fearlessly deep dive to make and break
    things in the process. Overall, my short stint as an MLE was a very fulfilling
    journey and laid the foundation for the next step of my journey.

    delve deeper into AI. During this time, I enjoyed taking the extra leap in building
    a portfolio website, LinkedIn profile and tailoring my resume to showcase my abilities.
    Basically, build a professional brand. Look at yourself two years from now and
    keep adding things that make sense for future goals. But that’s not all! This
    time also shaped my communication skills through various presentations, effectively
    allowing me to convey my ideas. Collaborating with professionals from diverse
    backgrounds helped me build a strong network that would last a lifetime. I also
    had several opportunities to work on exciting hands-on projects as part of the
    coursework, which helped me build a research portfolio and instilled a passion
    for research deeply.

    to push the boundaries of a niche domain while still making a positive impact
    in the community. Additionally, you get opportunities to collaborate with fellow
    researchers across universities — this teaches you the process of preparing for
    research lab meetings, critical thinking, and scientific writing. It also opens
    the door to attending technical conferences where one can engage with experts
    from diverse domains across the globe. This, combined with the freedom to explore
    an area of interest, is what I call an ideal “Researcher’s World” — one where
    curiosity, resilience, collaboration, and impact intertwine. My research experiences
    fall under the larger umbrella of Responsible AI, and I aspire to be an expert
    in privacy-preserving AI/ML systems. What intellectually stimulates me every day
    is the process of reading existing literature, formulating research questions,
    and designing experiments to test my hypotheses.

    me: coursework, project-based, and thesis-based. Right from the start, I made
    the decision to pursue a thesis, as it ensured that the path to a PhD would always
    remain open to me. The thesis is the most challenging path to Master’s completion
    and is very similar to PhD dissertation but on a much smaller scale. I consider
    myself fortunate to have found a thesis advisor whose interests aligned closely
    with mine. I had gained interest in working with computer vision based generative
    models before the Generative AI buzz erupted in the industry. After months of
    immersing myself in the relevant literature, multiple iterations of carefully
    designed experiments, and 1:1 meetings with my advisor, I successfully completed
    my thesis on “[Phoenix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04098) — A Federated Generative
    Diffusion Model.”'

    keeping track of pre-prints and peer-reviewed works within your domain of interest
    (2) Be proactive in identifying opportunities and addressing gaps in the dynamic
    field of AI (3) Prepare for rigorous experimentation to test your approach thoroughly.
    For all Master’s students aiming to pursue a PhD, here’s my two cents: enjoy the
    journey of learning, and remember to seize every opportunity that goes beyond
    the curriculum.'

- en: Once I set my sights on pursuing a PhD in AI, I realized there was a lot to
    be done — with no clue where and how to begin the admission process. Being the
    first in my family to venture into this unknown territory, there was a lot of
    self-learning through blogs and videos, each of them detailing their personal
    journeys of applying for a PhD. The core essence of what I have understood and
    followed is explained below,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Program** — Dive deeper into the details and research the program you would
    like to pursue (CS, AI, or EE). Then narrow down your research interests. This
    could be something that you were already familiar with (or) you could opt to venture
    into a new and exciting area that you are passionate about exploring further.'

- en: '**University —** There are no guidelines on how you choose universities, but
    individuals typically follow a number of university-ranking websites (like csranking,
    drafty.cs, usnews) and apply to a mix of dream schools, target schools, and safety
    schools. However, I would advise not to stick to the ranking list and make it
    the sole determining factor during the decision-making process. The research facilities,
    interdisciplinary collaboration, and funding opportunities mean much more. Remember,
    your life as a PhD student is heavily dependent on the quality of research and
    guidance from your advisor, which is more important than the university itself.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Potential advisor —** This is probably the most important factor to consider.
    Read your potential advisor’s publications, and see if anything particularly piques
    your interest. Establishing a strong and supportive relationship for the next
    4+ years of your life is crucial — allocate ample time during this process to
    thoroughly decide for yourself. Personally, I chose two advisors per university
    who aligned with my research interests. I also made notes of key points (Works
    of theirs I was impressed with, Why I’m a good fit, Our common goals and interests,
    etc.) that I could mention through personal communication and my application essay.'

- en: '**Statement of Purpose —** This will be your best chance of demonstrating your
    writing skills and highlighting your research accomplishments. Please don’t start
    with generic phrases like “Ever since I was born, I wanted to do research.” Be
    realistic and proudly describe your background in research, including when and
    where it originated. You should also provide a detailed explanation of your most
    notable research works, community involvement, and volunteer activities. Additionally,
    add key points on why you would choose to work with a particular advisor and how
    it could strengthen your research career. This essay should clearly articulate
    your strengths on why you deserve a place in their university/research lab to
    pursue PhD. I have seen sample essays that also highlight personal challenges
    and how they were overcome, but that’s entirely up to you to decide whether or
    not you would like to include them in the SoP. While it’s important to add all
    such technical details, don’t forget to infuse your personal touch that best represents
    you. It’s not a report!'

- en: '**Recommendation Letters —** You will need powerful recommendation letters
    from at least three professors. However, you could even request letters from two
    professors and an individual who is well-known in the industry. Although the content
    of the letters is confidential, you can request letters from individuals you have
    a strong work relationship with. By doing this, there is a greater chance that
    these letters will convey positive thoughts about your character and ability to
    perform research independently.'

    comprehensive list of all universities that I intended to apply to. Here are some
    of the fields of the sheet, but feel free to customize it according to your need,
    as there isn’t one template that fits all.

    To make the process more manageable and less overwhelming, I made it a point to
    apply to one university a day. Once the applications were submitted, the waiting
    phase began. This phase started with the temptation to check gradcafe, discord
    groups which made it all the more difficult to concentrate on everyday activities.
    I would recommend not getting stuck in this cycle like me since the results will
    gradually roll out after February. Around this period, you may also start receiving
    emails from professors expressing their interest in further conversations (like
    a match interview), whether in person or virtually.

    applying for PhD. While it may sound tough and challenging, the process is worth
    it. Don’t get swayed by peers or those around you who did not take this path.
    By choosing the road less traveled, the process is all the more exciting and requires
    immense passion and effort! Best of luck and I’ll see you on the other side :)
