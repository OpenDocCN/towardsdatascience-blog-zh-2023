- en: I came to write this article through what was a predictable yet still unexpected
    set of events. I recently finished a course on statistical testing and reporting,
    and I set out to write a series of articles explaining the details of the most
    useful statistical tests I learned. I wished to do this both to cement my own
    knowledge as well as help other data scientists learn a topic I found immensely
    helpful.

- en: The first of these articles was going to be on the **t-test**, a common statistical
    test used to determine if two means (averages) from different sets of data are
    statistically different. I began to write this article, but I realized I needed
    to first explain that there are two different kinds of t-tests. Then, I realized
    that to explain that, I needed to explain a separate but related underlying concept.
    The cycle continued as I planned out the article.

    wrote, as every statistical test required the same underlying knowledge base.
    Rather than repeat this information in each article, it would be much better to
    reference one standing source…
