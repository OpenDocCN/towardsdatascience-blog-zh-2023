    the language of the text we want to translate**.

    to be more accurate thanks to the precision of the source language in its prompts.
    For human translators, knowing the source language is critical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    when indicating the source language. We can assume that ChatGPT can automatically
    infer the source language from the user input. If this is the case, providing
    the source language shouldn’t have any impact, instead of the negative impact

    The authors chose a very original way by letting ChatGPT itself suggest prompts.
    But **prompting ChatGPT to suggest prompts** is a chicken and egg problem. The
    prompt itself used to get prompts for machine translation may have a strong impact
    on all the following experiments performed in this study. Previous work on prompt
    designing for machine translation tried very diverse and handcrafted prompts.
