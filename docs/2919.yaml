    depicts proteins spread as in a modern view of the universe where brighter clusters
    contain more members. On zooming the user can inspect related proteins, until
    clicking on a specific node displays information (here only a structural model
    shown) about a protein family in the context of Uniprot. Picture composed by the

- en: '**The recent release of over 200 million predicted protein structures by DeepMind’s
    AlphaFold 2, in collaboration with the European Institute of Bioinformatics, has
    ushered in a new era of protein research. Here I’m presenting a summary of findings
    from two groundbreaking papers published in *Nature* this week, which delve into
    the depths of this protein universe. These papers employ innovative clustering
    algorithms, structural comparisons, and other adaptations of existing tools to
    work on large data volumes, to shed light on the structural diversity, evolutionary
    relationships, and functional potential of proteins at an unprecedented scale.**'

- en: Proteins are the workhorses of biology, governing a myriad of cellular processes,
    from energy generation to cell division. While the sequencing of proteins has
    burgeoned over the years, thanks to advances in genomics, the determination of
    their 3D structures has lagged behind due to the dearth of scalable experimental
    methods. However, with the advent of AlphaFold 2, a revolutionary AI system developed
    by DeepMind, the landscape of protein structure prediction has been…
