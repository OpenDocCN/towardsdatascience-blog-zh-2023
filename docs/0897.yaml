    many data scientists struggle to carve out the time to start one. Even if you
    have some free time, settling on an idea can be a challenge: it has to be relevant
    to your interests, reasonably scoped, and challenging enough (but not so difficult
    that it becomes a painful slog).'

    might just unlock your creativity and inspire you to venture into a new topic.
    Follow one (or several) of them step by step, or treat any of these recommendations
    as the starting point for an entirely different learning adventure. Either way,
    the most important thing is to choose *something.* You’ll sort out the details
    as you go.

    If you can’t wait to dive into some code, [Marie Truong](https://medium.com/u/4cfa1d0b321f?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)’s
    tutorial on building an ELT (extract, load, transform) workflow will get you to
    roll up your proverbial sleeves in no time. Among other useful components, you’ll
    get to play with an API and find your way around BigQuery.'

    Has all the endless buzz around AI made you feel a bit disoriented? A good way
    to re-find your bearings is to build an app that does something tangible with
    this rapidly evolving technology. [Mason McGough](https://medium.com/u/b2676483d419?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)’s
    project walkthrough will show you how to build a Stable Diffusion app that removes
    people from images—a neat idea in itself, and one that might inspire you to explore
    other directions, too.'

    Mastering a complex concept is easier when its various elements become more concrete.
    Case in point: [Aparna Dhinakaran](https://medium.com/u/f32f85889f3a?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)
    and Jason Lopatecki’s primer on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, where they patiently
    explain the math behind it as well as its practical applications in the context
    of monitoring model drift.'

    If your learning style responds well to detailed, slow-and-steady guidance, give
    [Jacky Kaub](https://medium.com/u/7ccb7065ef90?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)’s
    series on creating a map-based application a try. It will take you from proof
    of concept to minimum viable product over the course of three patient articles;
    by the end of part 1 you’ll already have a minimalist demo in hand.'

    Lachert](https://medium.com/u/a8d3ad6ac83c?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)’s
    debut TDS post starts with a straightforward premise: “the best way to check if
    you really understand how neural networks learn is to implement the whole process
    all by yourself.” Piotr goes on to do precisely that, leading readers through
    the implementation of basic neural networks in Python.'

    [Nazlı Alagöz](https://medium.com/u/4ba02da50bf?source=post_page-----8b05851dce91--------------------------------)’s
    tutorial uses the example of a hypothetical music-streaming service to unpack
    the complexity of drawing causal insights, and looks closely at the limitations
    of the difference-in-differences (DiD) approach when dealing with data shaped
    by staggered treatment timing and multiple time periods.'

    If Nazlı’s post piqued your curiosity about causal inference and you’re ready

    to this essential topic, and you’ll find several excellent tutorials there.'
