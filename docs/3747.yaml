    (and your own success). To some extent, this is one of the most important decisions
    you have to make every month / quarter / day (depending on your prioritization
    process).

    fit my needs, to help decide which projects to work on. So this is the exercise
    we’ll be trying in the article — coming up with a mental model to help make better
    prioritization decisions.

    there are multiple macro-elements that can impact your study: Data Availability,
    Skillset, Timeframe, Organization Readiness, and Political Environment.'
  prefs: []

- en: Each of those elements can generate some risks in your study. If you don’t have
    the right data, you most likely won’t be able to get the right answer. If you
    don’t have the right skillset, or if the distance between your current skillset
    and the one you need to acquire is too high, or if your organization is not ready
    to implement any of your results, or if there might be some political hurdles
    to the implementation — you have a higher risk of your project failing.

    you can score your potential project in a simple way — using a 1–5 scoring system

    we mentioned above.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to consider “second order” impact. Some data projects will have
    an impact “by themselves”. Others will enable other people to have more impact
    (e.g. dashboard). Others will unlock some data analysis that were “locked” until
    then (e.g. data pipeline).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “depth” of the value is not the only criteria to take into account — but
    the “width” also. For instance, building a dashboard might generate a small amount
    of value but for a large number of users — which in aggregate is actually a lot
    of value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Impact needs to be considered with regard to the temporality of the work and
    the need. If your industry is rapidly evolving, or if there are some early signs
    of a shift in the company strategy — it is important to factor that in in your
    impact calculation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL

    the different projects and understand which ones might generate the highest value.
