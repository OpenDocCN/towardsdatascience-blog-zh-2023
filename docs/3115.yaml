    of having a never ending list of tools you would like to learn, hopefully some
    day soon. For me, one of the items on my list for a very long time was [Observable
    Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/), a JavaScript library for exploratory data
    visualization. Finally this year, I decided to use the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://30daychartchallenge.org/about/)
    to dive into this amazing library. As a first-time participant in this challenge,
    I want to share my experience and the insights gained as well as provide advice
    for those contemplating participation in similar upcoming challenges.

    visualization, which is interpretable by the data viz creator. There is no limitation
    on the data source or tool used to create these visualizations. It is a fascinating
    event for data enthusiasts, designers, and aspiring data visualization artists.'

    ideas, find data sources, and sketch out rough designs beforehand. Planning ahead
    before the challenge starts allows you to focus on the visualization process and
    learning without feeling overwhelmed each day. Some of my favorite data sources
    that I browsed through generously were from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
    and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

    data on [Cumulative Land Use Change](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv)
    for six countries over a century time period. On Day 28 the prompt was “Trend”,
    and I thought this data would be perfect for that as well. So instead of a new
    story, I focused on how to tell the story through animation so I could learn something
    new using the same data while also saving time from data hunting.'

    the Observable Plot library was the primary focus. This clarity helped me stay
    committed and motivated throughout the process. Sometimes that meant that I had
    to settle with a good enough plot that took longer even though there are other
    tools that I am already comfortable with like ggplot2 with which I could have
    made nicer plots in less duration.

    lifespan data](https://data.world/animals/zoo-animal-lifespans). This simple line
    and dot plot took me way too long to figure out because I was learning a new tool
    but felt worth it when I accomplished it.

    out the best possible visualization into the world. Embracing the learning process
    and accepting that not every visualization will be perfect was key to not burning
    out from the challenge. Focus on improving your skills and understanding of data
    visualization concepts.

    long day of work when I sat down for the challenge, I wanted to learn to create
    a radial plot to see how the [Superbowl ad category distribution](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/superbowl-ads)
    has changed over time. I had envisioned creating it for all categories and I started
    with the 4 I was most interested in observing. While that wasn’t the final plan
    and it was difficult to stop there, I decided to call it a day at 4 categories
    in order to not burn out and have energy for the next day’s visualization.

    and growth, and most importantly don’t fall into the trap of comparing your work
    to others’ but use it for inspiration. Remember that the challenge is about personal
    growth and learning. The first few plots I put out are nowhere near the amazing
    visualizations I saw from others, but reminding myself that I will be bad before
    I get better was important in those initial days.

    draining but impactful, so whenever you can participate is good enough and you
