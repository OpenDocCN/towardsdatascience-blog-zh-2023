- en: As customer acquisition costs on digital media continue to soar, more and more
    consumer brands look to diversify their marketing spending. Brands are re-evaluating
    traditional channels like TV, radio, in-store marketing, etc. However, data tracking
    is limited for these channels. Now brands face the new challenge of reliably measuring
    marketing performance across all channels.

    of COVID. Understanding marketing and sales performance holistically is difficult
    for brands selling both online and offline.

    uncover how these marketing efforts pay off (or not). As IDFA and cookies fade
    away, measuring view-through ad performance with attribution approaches becomes
    a mission impossible.

    economic uncertainty, preventing such a waste of money is more critical than ever.
    Therefore, brand executives are tasking their marketing and data teams to explore
    potential solutions and determine the most effective ones. In this article, I
    will discuss how you can tackle these dilemmas with marketing mix modeling (MMM)
    and gain an edge in today’s challenging economy.

    is through regression. We can discover whether the variable brings a return by
    evaluating the correlation between each independent variable and return.

    macro economy and other external factors, and revenue, and then attribute the
    conversion credit to each input. Typical MMM inputs include the following.

    storefront, Amazon, Sephora, and convenience stores, and it spends sizable marketing
    budgets on Google, Meta, Amazon, TV, podcast, and in-store. Every month, it wants
    to understand how its ad spend affects sales across channels. The beauty brand
    is also interested in learning the best marketing budget allocation for the following
    month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From experience, many beauty brand customers see ads online and purchase offline
    later, and vice versa. Therefore, it’s unrealistic to separate online and offline
    channels’ performance.

    and daily sales data into the model, the brand can see how each variable contributes
    to sales over time.

    from the beauty brand can evaluate how well the models fit their business and
    decide whether to accept the model results.

    models, the beauty brand will get the associated revenue forecasts in those scenarios.

- en: MMM ingests aggregated data like daily ad spend and sales data instead of granular
    user-level data like clickstream. Ad spend and sales data are usually accessible
    from major marketing and sales platforms, and each data attribute generally follows
    similar measures. Therefore, brands can expect comparable marketing measurement
    across ad platforms. Without such comparability, marketing measurement will be
    unreliable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, MMM provides a reliable measurement for view-through ads. If brands
    try to measure view-through ad performance with attribution models, the measurement
    is likely underestimated. Since attribution models rely on clickstream data, if
    a user sees an ad but doesn’t click on it, the models won’t know whether a user
    has viewed it. In such cases, MMM becomes an excellent complement to attribution
    models.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since MMM takes aggregated data, it requires dynamic and long-term marketing
    data to detect enough market signals. Therefore, only brands investing heavily
    in marketing can utilize MMM. Further, if a brand wants to measure a particular
    marketing channel, the brand must have active marketing activities on that channel
    for an extended period. Otherwise, MMM can’t generate meaningful results due to
    the lack of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, MMM generally can only measure on the ad platform level at best, and it
    is unable to measure on a campaign level. That is because most brands won’t generate
    enough data points on a particular campaign.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, from time to time, brands need to run experiments on campaigns to create
    dynamic marketing movements for MMM to work. Not all teams will have the bandwidth
    to operate campaigns properly to make the best of MMM.

    Marketers and data teams should look for a combination of techniques that best
    fit their use cases and help them make more profits through marketing. In the
    current economy, it’s essential to operate with less, and marketing measurement
    approaches can help us achieve that.
