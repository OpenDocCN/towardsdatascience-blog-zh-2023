    articles are written by our editorial teams. These articles inform Dutch citizens
    about the news, but also make for an interesting and high quality data set from
    a Natural Language Processing point of view. In this blog I, as the Data Scientist
    at NOS, report on several experiments performed by applying Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) to our data set of Dutch news articles and present several ideas on how
    NER can be applied within the context of news.

- en: A named entity (NE) is a special type of word that refers to real-world objects
    with proper names, for example *persons*, *locations* or *organisations*. Models
    exist that automatically recognise these types of words, which are called Named
    Entity Recognition (NER) models. An example of such a NER model applied to an
    excerpt of one our articles is shown in the figure on the right below, where the
    NE are highlighted and annotated with the NE type.

    [1], [Flair](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-dutch-large) [2] or [NTLK](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html)
    [3]. We performed a qualitative evaluation on these three models, by means of
    applying them to a random sample of our articles and manually inspecting the results.
    From this we decided to use spaCy for the remainder of our experiments. An overview
    of all NE types that this model may recognise is presented in the Figure 1 below
    on the left.

- en: Using the pre-trained model from spaCy, we applied NER to several subsets of
    our data set. We started by collecting all articles for a single month (February
    2023), split the data into the categories *news* and *sport* (1.030 and 596 articles
    respectively), and then applied NER to obtain the total frequency counts per NE
    type. The results for *news* and *sports* are shown in Figure 2, and immediately
    showcase the significance of NEs in news. It can be seen that in just one month
    of articles, tens of thousands NEs are mentioned in the articles. To put this
    in perspective, on average an article contains 404 words, and about 10% of words
    in articles are NEs. It can also be seen in the figures below that the most frequently
    mentioned NE types differ for *news* and *sport*. For news the majority of NE
    types are countries, followed by organisations and persons. While for sport the
    most frequent NE type is persons, followed by countries and numerals. This might
    be explained by *sport* mentioning scores (cardinal) and individual athletes (person),
    while *news* covers events for which it is often relevant to mention the location
    (gpe).

- en: We performed a case study using all articles on the World Cup football 2022,
    consisting of 482 articles in total. NER was applied to the data set to detect
    all NEs with the type *Person*. 2.171 unique NEs were found, of which 1.296 were
    mentioned just once. In Figure 3A we present an overview of the most frequently
    mentioned persons during this event. Additionally, for the most frequently mentioned
    persons, we created a streamgraph to show how the mention frequencies develop
    over time, as can be seen in Figure 3B. This for instance shows that *van Gaal*
    is mentioned frequently throughout the whole tournament, while others are mentioned
    mostly on specific days. These kind of graphs may provide our editorial teams
    with new kinds of insights, as they are quantitative reflections of what the NOS
    writes about. Such insights are efficiently powered by NER. For now we applied
    this specifically for the World Cup 22, but one can come up with many different
    settings where these kinds of graphs may be interesting. For instance think about
    which politicians or political parties are mentioned during elections, or more
    generally, the mention frequencies of countries, cities, organisations and so
    on for a larger time range.

    and posed ourselves the question “*Can we use NER to generate summaries for a
    Named Entity?*”.We started by developing a module that collects all articles mentioning
    a given NE, which could serve as a collection of all information available on
    the given NE for users particularly interested in this NE. But, more interestingly,
    the module collects all sentences from this collection in which the NE is mentioned,
    resulting a summary of the collection. As an example, we applied the module for
    *Andries Noppert*, the goalkeeper for the Dutch national team. From Figure 3 it
    can already be seen that Noppert has been mentioned quite frequently during the
    event. Applying the module for Noppert resulted in a summary that quite nicely
    outlines the remarkable story of our goalkeeper, which is shown below as translated
    from Dutch.

    NER can provide some interesting insights. There is one more experiment that we
    think is interesting to share in this blog relating to the research question “*Can
    we use NER to improve our content-based recommendation system?”.* Earlier on we
    developed a content-based recommendation system which was recently integrated
    into our news app. Using both online and offline tests we compared various models
    and optimisations, and we now observe an increased click-through-rate in our app.
    This is all great news, but we are always looking for ways to improve our recommendation
    system further. We received feedback from our editorial teams stating the recommender
    is confused for articles containing names of persons or places that are also regular
    words in the Dutch language. In the following section we report on an experiment
    using NER in an attempt to solve for this type of ambiguity.

    to vectorize texts. This basically means it relies heavily on word overlap to
    identify similar articles, but assigns higher relevance to words that are rare.
    One can imagine this method does not hold up when words have multiple meanings,
    which can be the case for NEs. As an example consider an article about the golfer
    *Tiger Woods*: a basic recommendation system might find related articles mentioning
    the animal *tiger* or articles about the *woods*. These would obviously not be
    useful recommendations. We hypothesised that this could be solved by introducing
    NE-awareness in our recommender by means of annotating NEs in texts by their type.
    In this case, the tokens would no longer overlap, as illustrated in Figure 5.'

    and a combination of all these. We evaluated the various models using a test set
    that was manually annotated by our editorial teams and contains information on
    which articles are related. This test set contains 14.541 unique articles, and
    on average each article is linked to about 2 other articles. As an evaluation
    metric, we calculated the average rank of curated linked articles within the sorted
    recommendations.

- en: Figure 6 shows the results for our base model and the various NE-aware models.
    It can be seen that actually our base model outperforms all types of NE-aware
    models. In theory introducing NE-awareness would improve the recommender, but
    in practice we see that it introduces more ambiguity than it solves. We looked
    into the output of the various models in detail, and saw that we are limited by
    the performance of the NER model. The spaCy NER model as evaluated on their own
    test set yields an F-score of 0.77, but this score may be lower when applied to
    another data set, so one can expect the model to be inaccurate occasionally. From
    a manual inspection of some recommendations output by the NE-aware models we saw
    that in combination with TF-IDF the effect of incorrectly detected NEs is quite
    strong. For articles with incorrectly detected NE, the output recommendations
    often contain the same incorrectly detected NE. We saw for example an article
    containing the word *hindsight* which was classified as a NE of type Person, resulting
    in recommendations that contained the same incorrectly classified NE *hindsight*.
    While NER is off in this case, the recommendations make sense, because TF-IDF
    will assign a higher relevance to tokens like *hindsight_Person* as they very
    rare in the corpus. Our conclusion is that the pre-trained Dutch NER models are
    at this point not accurate enough to be incorporated into our recommendation system.

    For now we explored another approach to solve for NE-ambiguity by using metadata
    such as categories and keywords as a noiseless but less strongly related measure
    for NE, which improved our recommender quite a bit.

    applied to a Dutch news data set. We saw it works well when applied for deriving
    general insights about the data set such as the construction of NE frequency plots
    and streamgraphs. However, when applied for our recommender we saw the models
    were not accurate enough. While introducing NE-awareness resolved some NE-ambiguity,
    it simultaneously introduced new ambiguity in the form of errors in NE detection.
    In the future we might experiment with finetuning a pre-trained model or training
    our own model from scratch, or if you have any suggestions yourself, let us know
    in the comments!
