Secure Yard Items: Unsecure items can be swept away or damaged by floodwaters. Secure items in your yard by anchoring them or attaching them to more substantial structures.\n\n7\\. Seal Cracks and Gaps: Check caulking around windows and doors to make sure it is not cracked, broken, or missing. Fill any holes or gaps around pipes and wires that enter your building.\n\n8\\. Prepare or Update a List of Belongings: Documenting all of your belongings will help with the insurance claims process.\n\n9\\. Get Flood Insurance: Most homeowners insurance policies don’t cover flood damage. Protect your investment by purchasing flood insurance for your home and contents.\n\n10\\. Store Valuables: Store valuables and important documents in waterproof or water-resistant containers above the BFE.\n\n11\\. Elevate Utilities Above the BFE: Elevate or floodproof mechanical units, furnaces, water heaters, electrical systems, and other utilities.\n\n12\\. Replace Carpeting with Tiles: Tiles are more flood-resistant than carpet. Using tile or other flood-resistant materials in areas below the BFE can help reduce water damage.\n\n13\\. Floodproof Basements: Minimize damage by floodproofing your basement and sealing walls with waterproofing compounds. Consider installing a sump pump.\n\n14\\. Install Flood Vents: Install flood vents in foundation walls, garages, and other enclosed areas to allow water to flow through, drain out, and lower the risk of structural damage.\n\n15\\. Use Flood-Resistant Insulation & Drywall: Flood-resistant insulation and drywall will help minimize damage and can be easily cleaned and sanitized.\n\n16\\. Prevent Sewage Back-Up: In some areas, flooding can cause sewage to back up through drain pipes in your home. Consult with a plumber and, if applicable, invest in a sewer backflow valve to prevent this potential health hazard.\n\nRemember to consult professionals such as your insurance agent, architects, engineers, contractors, or other experts in design and construction before making changes to your home.\n\n{\n    \"page_content\": \"This snippet relates to  fema protect your home flooding:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\nDIRECT WATER AWAY \\nFROM STRUCTURES If you have a single-family home, make sure your yard \\nslopes away from buildings on your property and that water has a place to drain.

Install or replace your roof with a Class A-rated roof with noncombustible coverings. The roof is the most at-risk part of a house in a wildfire due to its size and orientation.\n\n2\\. Install and replace exterior wall coverings with noncombustible or fire-resistant materials. A minimum fire-resistance rating of one hour for the wall assembly is recommended.\n\n3\\. Create a 30 feet defensible space around your home by reducing or removing flammable vegetation and using noncombustible materials such as gravel, brick, or concrete.\n\n4\\. Regularly clean and remove debris from the roof and gutters to reduce the likelihood of something catching on fire on top of your home.\n\n5\\. Enclose your home's foundation to lower the chance of wind-blown embers getting underneath your home.\n\n6\\. Plan for access to water by purchasing and installing external sprinkler systems with dedicated power sources or a water tank.\n\n7\\. Protect large windows from radiant heat by installing multi-pane windows, tempered safety glass, or fireproof shutters.\n\n8\\. Install highly visible street signs and property addresses to help firefighters and other emergency responders quickly find your property.\n\n9\\. Seal gaps around openings in exterior walls and roofs with fire-resistant caulk, mortar, or fire-protective expanding foam.\n\n10\\. Cover exterior attic vents and under-eave vents with metal wire mesh no larger than 1/8 inch to keep embers out.\n\n11\\. Install a fire block in the gap between the top of framed walls and the foundation of the house to starve the fire of oxygen and prevent it from spreading.\n\nRemember, these tips may work better together than others and need to be tailored to your property. Always consult professionals such as your insurance agent, architects, engineers, contractors, or other experts in design and construction before making changes to your home.\n```", "```py\nresult = ask_question(\"How do I make a sponge cake?\", pdf_qa, output_docs=False)\n```", "```py\nQuestion: \nHow do I make a sponge cake?\n\nAnswer:\nI'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information on how to make a sponge cake.\n```", "```py\nresult = ask_question(\"There's a hurricane coming, what should I do?\", pdf_qa, output_docs=False)\n\nQuestion: \nI need to take immediate action: There's a hurricane forecast, what should I do?\n\nAnswer:\nIf there's a hurricane forecast, you should take the following immediate actions:\n\n1\\. Check the flood risk for your area. You can do this by visiting https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home and entering your home’s address.\n\n2\\. Understand the difference between a Hurricane Watch and a Hurricane Warning. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within a specified area and is issued 48 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds. A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within a specified area and is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds.\n\n3\\. Take actions around your house to help reduce the impact of a flooding event. This could include placing sand bags in areas that are most at risk from flooding and elevating mechanical devices like air conditioners, generators, and circuit breakers to minimize the risk of impact by storm surge.\n\n4\\. Establish a central meeting point so that if the power does go out, people know where to meet up with their loved ones.\n\n5\\. Prepare a Go-Kit which should include water, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, batteries, a hand-crank/solar powered radio, non-perishable food, cash, a wrench, hand sanitizer, a mylar blanket, ear plugs, and a book and/or deck of cards.\n\n6\\. Make sure to have items and services in place before a hurricane watch or warning is issued. This could include packing comfort items for loved ones and ensuring that any relatives who require regularly scheduled mental health therapy have their providers aware of the location of the shelter.\n\n7\\. Store critical documents in Ziploc bags and keep them in a safe place. Alternatively, you can store them on a cloud drive, on a flash drive kept in an alternate location, or in a safety deposit box.\n\n8\\. Create a Go-Kit for your pet with essential items, including food, water, medication and favorite toys. Make sure your pet is microchipped or at least has ID tags displayed.\n\n9\\. Familiarize yourself with the predetermined coastal evacuation routes in your area.\n\n10\\. Plan for communication methods in case phone lines and cellular towers get damaged. This could include text messaging or using social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.\n```", "```py\nresult = ask_question(\"It's about to arrive, help!\", pdf_qa, output_docs=False, preprocess_time_context=True)\n\nQuestion: \nIt's about to arrive, help!\n\nAnswer:\nHere are some immediate actions you should take for safety:\n\n1\\.

Include your veterinarian’s contact information and be sure that your pet is microchipped or at least has the proper ID tags displayed. If you need to evacuate, take your pet with you if possible. If you cannot take your pet with you, ensure they are in a safe place with access to food and water.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nI need to take immediate action: My roof is blowing off!!! Help, what should I do?!!!\n\nAnswer:\nThe FEMA brochures do not provide specific instructions for immediate action if your roof is blowing off. However, it is generally recommended to seek immediate shelter in a safe area of your home, away from windows and potential falling debris. After the severe wind event, you should contact a professional to assess and repair the damage. It's also important to contact your insurance company to report the damage.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nI live next to a brook, should I worry about floods?\n\nAnswer:\nYes, you should be concerned about floods if you live next to a brook. Flooding can happen anywhere and is not limited to high-risk areas. Heavy rainfall or poor drainage can cause flooding, especially in low-lying areas. It's important to take steps to protect your home, such as elevating your home, securing yard items, and ensuring proper drainage. You should also consider purchasing flood insurance, as federal disaster assistance may be limited or unavailable without a presidential disaster declaration.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nIf I live inland, will sea level affect me?\n\nAnswer:\nSea level changes primarily affect coastal areas, causing increased flooding, erosion, and storm damage. However, if you live inland, you may still experience indirect effects. Changes in sea level can alter weather patterns, potentially leading to increased rainfall or drought in some areas. Additionally, if you rely on resources from coastal areas, such as seafood or tourism, changes in sea level could impact these industries. However, the snippet does not provide specific information on how sea level changes might affect those living inland.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nI am planning ahead: Is there a cheap way to get flood insurance?\n\nAnswer:\nYes, you can purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program. Most homeowners insurance policies don’t cover flood damage, so it's important to protect your investment by purchasing flood insurance for your home and its contents. This is recommended even if you do not live in a high-risk flood zone. For more information on purchasing flood insurance, you can visit FloodSmart.gov or contact your insurance agent to get coverage. Planning ahead and purchasing flood insurance before a storm or flood event is a cost-effective way to protect your property.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nI need to take immediate action: We're in an Earthquake, what should we do!!???\n\nAnswer:\nWhen an earthquake starts, you should \"Drop, Cover, and Hold On!\" This means you should drop to the ground, cover your head and neck with your arms, and if a safer place is nearby, crawl to it and hold on. If you are in bed, stay there and cover your head and neck with a pillow. If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly and safely as possible and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped, avoiding roads, bridges, or ramps that the earthquake may have damaged.\n\n ===================== \nLanguage detected: en\n\nQuestion: \nI am planning ahead: What things should I have in an emergency kit?\n\nAnswer:\nAn emergency kit should include the following items: \n\n- Water (one gallon per person, per day) and/or water purification tablets\n- A first-aid kit\n- A flashlight\n- Batteries\n- A hand-crank/solar-powered radio\n- Nonperishable food\n- Medications/prescription glasses\n- Cash (in small denominations)\n- A wrench (to turn off utilities)\n- Hand sanitizer\n- A Mylar blanket\n- Ear plugs\n- A book/deck of cards\n\nIf you have an infant, then include baby food, diapers, formula, etc. If you have pets, consider having a kit for them that includes food, water, medication, medical records, and a favorite toy. \n\nIn addition, consider including portable charging devices in your kit as this will allow you to charge from a motor vehicle. If a loved one is comforted by a certain item (a blanket, photograph, stuffed animal, etc.), be sure to pack the item when evacuating. If a relative requires regularly scheduled mental health therapy, make sure that his/her mental health provider is aware of the location of the shelter.\n```"]
