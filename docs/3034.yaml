    I conducted a thorough analysis of the most popular strategies for tackling the
    dynamic pricing problem using simple Multi-armed Bandits. If you’ve come here
    from that piece, firstly, thank you. It’s by no means an easy read, and I truly
    appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject. Secondly, get ready, as this new article
    promises to be even more demanding. However, if this is your introduction to the
    topic, I strongly advise beginning with the previous article. There, I present
    foundational concepts, which I’ll assume readers are familiar with in this discussion.

    scenario. The main goal was to assess as quickly as possible various price points
    to find the one yielding the highest cumulated reward. We explored four distinct
    algorithms: greedy, ε-greedy, Thompson Sampling, and UCB1, detailing the strengths
    and weaknesses of each. Although the methodology employed in that article is theoretically
    sound, it bears oversimplifications that don’t hold up in more complex, real-world…'
