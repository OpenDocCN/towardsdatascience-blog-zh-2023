    staged a play in Edinburgh, Scotland. The play had a curious title, “[Rosencrantz
    and Guildenstern Are Dead](http://www.sondheimguide.com/Stoppard/rosencrantz.html).”
    Its central characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are childhood friends of
    Hamlet (of Shakespearean fame). The play opens with Guildenstern repeatedly tossing
    coins which keep coming up Heads. Each outcome makes Guildenstern’s money-bag
    lighter and Rosencrantz’s, heavier. As the drumbeat of Heads continues with a
    pitiless persistence, Guildenstern is worried. He worries if he is secretly willing
    each coin to come up Heads as a self-inflicted punishment for some long-forgotten
    sin. Or if time stopped after the first flip, and he and Rosencrantz are experiencing
    the same outcome over and over again.

    if he and Rosencrantz are within the control of an unnatural reality where the
    laws of probability no longer operate.
