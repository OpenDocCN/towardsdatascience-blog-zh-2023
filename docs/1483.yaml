    to manage a data science *team* (versus data science *projects*, a topic that
    has considerably more content). In an attempt to address that gap, I wrote my
    original post: [“What I Learned in my First Six Months as a Director of Data Science.”](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-i-learned-in-my-first-6-months-as-a-director-of-data-science-d9b7b98a48f7)
    The response was largely positive to that post, so I decided that, now that I
    have been in the role of Director of Data Science for 1 year, I would update the
    original post based on the next 6 months of my experience. Some of the learnings
    are unchanged, although I have observed new things about them or have learned
    more details about them. Others have changed in the evolving layoff situations
    in the tech world. For more background on myself and why I started writing about
    these things, please see my original article.'

    new jobs. However, I quickly noticed that the data scientists and machine learning
    engineers were not really there in great numbers. I also noted that my friends
    working in the field at these companies were not being laid off. My (anecdotal)
    conclusion to this is that data scientists still have a fair bit of job security
    in the tech world, including with the FAANG companies. Those that I have found
    that have been laid off have been quickly scooped up by other tech companies.
    So in this regard, my hiring situation has not changed in the past 6 months even
    though the tech world has.

    how people code. I look at the code and its overall organization. Does the candidate
    use well-crafted classes? Are the functions clear and include docstrings, type
    hinting, and other helpful debugging things? Is there some sort of testing implemented?
    What does the overall documentation look like? Did they just copy and paste from
    the scikit-learn docs or did they put some thought into hyperparameters and going
    beyond the doc’s example problems?

    coding challenge or a real-time coding exercise. However, are these fair evaluations

    cons to each. These have been discussed in a variety of settings, but I will just
    briefly summarize them.
  prefs: []

    has time available to do them. It does not consider that they might still be working
    in their “day job” from 9–5 and that they might have family or other obligations
    that do not allow for the time it would take to adequately address the challenge.

    activities are monitored on their company-owned computer who does not own another
    computer? They will likely not want their boss seeing them working on a coding
    challenge on the company’s dime and resources. Further, many people do not do
    their best work in such a high-pressure situation. And really, is that the type
    of environment they would be working in on a daily basis? (Side note: if these
    high-pressure situations are how your team normally operates, you should maybe
    examine the culture that you have created for your team.)'

    packages, because you never know when I might try to run your code!)

    (if I do say so myself!) on the responsibilities of each. Again, in keeping with
    the historical use of them on this team, what the data scientists on the team
    do is experimentation and model creation, typically in notebooks and maybe some
    basic Python scripts. The machine learning engineers take those models and put
    them into production code and pipelines. In some companies, these might be called
    “data engineers” or “MLOps.” In other companies, the machine learning engineers
    are the ones writing the models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to hire people while using these ambiguous titles to really specify the day-to-day
    responsibilities. The more specific I have been on the job ads, the better the
    matches have been.

    number of (what I would call) data scientists applying for roles as (what I would
    call) machine learning engineers. They have not read the job ads. In the data
    science ads I have specified experience in statistics, modeling (traditional ML,
    deep learning, etc.), exploratory data analysis, etc. For the machine learning
    ads I have called out things like CI/CD, devops, Terraform, etc. Maybe I have
    still written the wrong job ads. Based on the numbers of data scientists applying
    for the machine learning roles (I would estimate it is greater than two thirds),
    the problem must be with me. It must be, right?
  prefs: []

    own have laws in place requiring hiring managers to disclose the pay range for
    the role. As we have discussed, tech companies typically can pay better than non-tech
    companies, and I work for the later. That is not to say that our problems are
    not exciting or worthwhile! It is just the nature of the business. And yet the
    number of applicants I get who state that their desired minimum salary is completely
    beyond what I have advertised is significant.
  prefs: []

    has not read the job ad. That is unfortunate for both the candidate and the hiring
    manager.

    However, if you have worked both at a tech and a non-tech company in your career,
    you know that this takes on much more meaning outside of the tech world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the tech world, you frequently have the opportunity to really specialize
    in a particular discipline. For example, when I worked for one employer as a machine
    learning engineer (which, for what it is worth, meant “data scientist” in my current
    company), I started getting very involved in graph data science. It both interested
    me on a technical level and helped solve some challenges for the company. If you
    have followed my other Medium posts, you have probably noticed that they revolve
    around graphs to the point that I went to work for a time at a graph database
    company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That model of specializing is much more difficult to do as a data scientist
    outside of tech. The difference stems from the fact that outside of tech your
    job is to solve business problems, not create the technology to solve those problems.
    As such, you need to be a generalist, not a specialist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This goes beyond just knowing which Python packages you will need and employing
    a diverse set to solve said problems. For example, my team is very well versed
    in cloud infrastructure. This is out of necessity. We don’t have an army of infrastructure
    folks ready to help us do this. Frequently we are advising the company on what
    that infrastructure looks like. We have had to teach ourselves infosec. Is that
    great or ideal? No. But it is how the human resourcing at non-tech companies works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many ways that is actually a lot of fun! If you are working in a generalist
    role, you must be constantly learning new things. I don’t expect everyone on my
    team will understand absolutely everything about how to create a production pipeline
    for our models, for example. But everyone is learning. I love learning new things.
    I think this is a requirement for a data scientist.

    we were using a certain very popular cloud provider. A colleague on my team decided
    to test out whether they were allowed to spin up the absolute fanciest GPU instance
    the provider offered, just for the sake of seeing if there was a limit for us.
    They left that instance running for more than a month without using it to calculate
    a thing. The total bill was tens of thousands of dollars. Nobody cared.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my responsibilities in my current role is to monitor budgets, particularly
    for our cloud infrastructure as well as our CI/CD pipelines, which I do on a weekly
    basis. We have a monthly budget (one that is significantly below what was spent
    on my previous story). When the budget was set it was quite realistic so we don’t
    usually have to worry about going over it, but it is there and we monitor for
    it. Sometimes we have people who don’t quite know how to manage CI/CD runner minutes,
    for example. When I see usage spike and put us in danger of going over, I ask
    the more senior members of the team to work with those working on the offending
    projects to make them more resource efficient. Like I said above, everyone is
    constantly learning.
  prefs: []

    that the salaries in tech tend to be higher than in non-tech. It might seem like
    I should just be able to go to my management and get more money for salaries.
    Unfortunately, this is not the way businesses work. One of my jobs is to fight
    for my team and the best salaries I can get for them. One of their jobs is to
    keep salaries across the company fairly consistent and within the larger budget
    picture. Frequently (always?) one of those it at odds with another. When you consider
    that data scientists are frequently the highest-paid ICs in a company, it is a
    hard sell for me to go to senior management and ask for even more money for salaries.
    This is the nature of the beast.

    solutions for the business. How is the quality of those solutions measured? One
    way is return on investment (ROI). Businesses exist to make money. That is obvious.
    Everyone must contribute to that mission. Models that do not contribute to that
    are models that never should have been developed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I will be the first to admit that I am not a marketer. (Although following my
    statements above about continuous learning, I am going back to school to get an
    MBA so I can learn about how marketing works.) Marketers are highly technical
    in a discipline that is not data science. So it is very important in my current
    role that I learn how to communicate with them.
  prefs: []

    that I cannot just throw a bunch of math and plots over the fence, and I especially
    cannot do that without explanations of what it means. I have presented at many
    data science conferences in my career and there are things that I can say there
    that I wouldn’t have to think twice about explaining. A great example of this
    are the variety of performance metrics used to evaluate models. People in marketing
    roles typically understand a term like “accuracy.” But mentioning “precision/recall,”
    “F1 scores,” or any other metrics that we consider standard will result in glossed
    over stares from them. Frankly, that is just fine and we shouldn’t expect them
    to go and get a degree in statistics to understand. We might think they should
    care, but at the end of the day they are looking to us to deliver a good model.

    off of a business problem that had been extensively discussed before data science
    hands ever touch a keyboard. I work very hard to get the stakeholders together
    and really spell out the business need. This typically cannot be achieved in a
    single meeting. This is done over many meetings. Sometimes the same meeting has
    to be repeated multiple times to catch the stakeholders whose calendars didn’t
    allow for them to attend the original meeting. And then many more meetings should
    happen to continue to define the problem and what the solution should look like.

    Are there any edits, comments, or questions? (Pro tip: email is *not* a great
    way to document these discussions. It needs to be some place more easily discoverable.)'

    Maybe it has a bug that wasn’t caught. Maybe the data doesn’t exist to create
    a model. Maybe it is discovered by the team or maybe it is discovered by the marketing
    folks. Regardless, trust is established through honesty. This seems like it should
    be obvious, but I have seen too many instances in my career where a data scientist
    has quietly swept something under the rug because it doesn’t put the team or the
    model in the best light.
  prefs: []

- en: Marketers are typically not statisticians. When something breaks or they don’t
    understand it, it is very easy to blame the math (or those who created it). And
    let’s face it. Machine learning math can easily be seen as a black box and very
    hard to accept or believe. When there is an honest, open, trusting relationship,
    it is harder for a lack of trust in the team or the models to bring things down.
