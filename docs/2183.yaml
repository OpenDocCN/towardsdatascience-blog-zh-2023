    money in the bank and which ones didn’t. Regardless of whether you work as a Lifecycle
    Marketing Manager in a B2B company where you optimize for driving free trials
    to paid customers or as a Data Scientist in a B2C eCommerce and optimize for getting
    first-time users to buy your product, each user has value to you.
