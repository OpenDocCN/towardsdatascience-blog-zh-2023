- en: In a product organisation aiming to build AI capabilities into their products
    and services, there is always the challenge of bringing the non-AI-literates onboard
    the AI train. While not everybody needs to be an AI expert, it is necessary to
    have as many as possible contributing with ideas and possibilities of exploiting
    the power of AI to propel the company to the next level. This applies in particular
    to domain experts and product people, who are on top of the problems their products
    and services are trying to solve, and knowing where the shoe pinches.

- en: One challenge I have learned is prevalent, is the basic question of “*Which
    problems can we solve with AI?”*. A question that is surprisingly hard to answer
    when posed by a non-expert. So I have devised three heuristic questions that you
    can use whenever you are looking at a problem, and you are wondering “Can this
    be solved with AI?”. If you can answer yes to all three of them, you may find
    yourself in position to start an AI project.

- en: We have all seen AIs answering the “dog in the picture” question, so we know
    that this function exists. We have also seen the weather forecast, so we know
    it is possible, to some extent, to predict tomorrow’s weather. But there is no
    way to predict next week’s lottery numbers. And the reason for this is that the
    lottery is rigged exactly with the goal of this function not to exist. It is impossible.
    And this is what I mean by “on a metaphysical level”.

    can a human answer the question? Clearly, humans are pretty good at recognising
    dogs in pictures. And humans did develop weather forecasts, and do them too. But,
    we are not able to predict next week’s lottery numbers.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one is a wee bit more technical. The key to the question is that the oracle
    function often needs more information than just the question to find the answer.
    The informed human being, doing the job as oracle, may need additional information
    to make a decision or produce an answer. This is what I refer to as the *context*.

    conditions as well as conditions from some days back to do forecasting. This information
    is not contained in the phrase “What is the weather going to be tomorrow?”

    in the picture, and no additional context is required.

- en: The AI then makes a guess before receiving the true answer, and over time it
    is hoped that the AI will learn the difference between cats and dogs. But for
    this to happen, the difference must be available, so that the AI can learn to
    identify the difference. In the case of pictures, this is straightforward — you
    just have to make sure the pictures are of sufficient quality to make the distinction
    possible. In the case of weather forecasting, it becomes more complicated — you
    actually have to make an informed decision to what information is required to
    make a weather prediction. This is a question best answered by domain experts,
    so you may have to reach out to get a good answer to this one.

    informed human to answer the question, then there is little hope for the AI to
    learn how to answer the question also. You need that context.'

    still be hurdles to overcome, and perhaps it turns out to be too difficult in
    the end. But that is the topic of another post.
