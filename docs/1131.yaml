    I say ‘A lot’, I mean it. Working with unfamiliar piles of data is often daunting
    and it’s always a good practice to take some time to explore and understand the
    data itself. It’s good to have basic data retrieval skills but knowing analytical
    functions to derive some useful insights out of your data is cherry on top of
    a cake and it’s fun too!

    understand the data but also figuring out any noteworthy findings to highlight
    it to the wider teams. Also building complex dashboards is quite often a to-and-fro
    process at where you go back to your data source to tally the data and SQL Window
    Functions have always accompanied me in my data analysis journey.

    and people are often frighten to use them. While writing a detailed guide to SQL
    Window Functions, I realised it was becoming way too descriptive and yet I did
    not want to skip details especially about the syntax and clauses used along with
    it. It’s important to understand the building blocks, yeah? So, I will try and
    break down the building blocks of Window Function in this…
