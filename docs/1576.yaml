    and services. However, many data scientists get too caught up in creating the
    perfect model and using state of the art techniques. By doing this, they forget
    the most important thing: delivering a functional minimum viable product (MVP).
    In this post, I’ll discuss three reasons why it’s better to focus on getting a
    working MVP first before spending too much time on creating a complex model. To
    end the post, I give three tips for creating a MVP.**'

    in topics like Naive Bayes, linear regression, and statistics. Maybe it was because
    of my mathematical background, and I had already learned these topics during my
    studies. Instead, I was way more interested in neural networks, language models,
    computer vision, and reinforcement learning. These topics intrigued me, and I
    took courses to learn them as quickly as possible. When I had to deal with real
    business problems at companies, I always tried complex models and solutions that
    I found fun to work on, often involving deep learning, datasets scraped from the
    web, and complex architecture…
