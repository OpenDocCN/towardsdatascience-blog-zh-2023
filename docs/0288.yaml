    Regardless of their geographic location, product, financial situation, or industry
    experience, they all have one thing in common: customer acquisition keeps them
    up at night. To fuel customer acquisition, companies spend relentless efforts
    to build their marketing engine. Great marketing brings in traffic, improves conversion
    rate, and reduces costs.'

    companies only invest in their target customers. Traditionally, these efforts
    rely heavily on industry and marketing experience. However, forming a team with
    both kinds of expertise is challenging. As you can imagine, industry experts focus
    on their markets and products and are often not marketing experts. On the other
    hand, marketing talents that happen to understand a specific market are rare and
    often expensive. The situation is even more difficult for startups defining new
    product categories.

    acquire marketing experiences unique to their vertical by regularly launching
    experiments, monitoring performance in real-time, and quickly iterating based
    on market feedback. Moreover, data science takes care of high-dimensional marketing
    data better than manual efforts and brings richer insights to serve business decisions.
    In this article, I will discuss low-lift data analytics approaches proven to improve
    marketing decisions and how to apply them step by step.

    When companies have limited resources, which is always the case, spreading too
    thin across all initiatives leads to loosing an edge in the fierce market competition.
    Investing in the right customers provides more possibilities for success.

    In this case, it can set the customer value calculation timeframe to one year.
    Based on its sales and marketing attribution systems, the brand can calculate
    one-year revenue and acquisition costs for each customer (or visitor that doesn’t
    convert). With that, the brand quickly gets each customer’s value and decides
    who is worth its marketing budget.

    of the customers bring low to negative value to the companies, and therefore should
    be ignored or discouraged. The split between the left and right in the graph below
    generally follows the 80/20 rule.

    in a business are doomed to not yield positive results. In a startup, as much
    as 95% of the work is ineffective. Companies must quickly isolate what’s working
    among the noises to succeed. By closely monitoring marketing performance in real-time,
    companies have the best chance to distinguish the good signal vs. the bad signal

    campaigns toward the high-value cohort. The campaigns run across ad platforms
    like Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc. The brand implements everything based on hypotheses
    — it considers customers like something, but it doesn’t know for sure. Only when
    the brand collects and evaluates campaign performance data can it tell which campaigns
    are worth investment vs. not.

    experience will likely not generate expected returns. Therefore, companies need

    apply vs. not.

    initial success. When the next big holiday, Mother’s Day, approaches, the brand
    wants to understand whether Valentine’s Day experience applies. Therefore, it
    runs customer segmentation to analyze what factors contribute to Valentine’s Day’s
    success. From the analysis, the brand discovers that only a subset of Valentine’s
    Day’s target customers overlaps with Mother’s Day ones. And it can likely deploy
    the campaign strategy that works for the subset in Mother’s Day promotion.

    a test-and-learn process for a sample and validate whether the experience is applicable
    for the new opportunity. Some common approaches for test-and-learn include A/B

    campaign with all the lessons from Valentine’s Day. Most lessons are still valid,
    but creatives and messaging can have some tweaks. The brand modifies its campaign
    and tests at a larger scale. It goes through the same process a few times daily

    for most businesses. Once companies find out how to attract each customer segment
    in terms of marketing channels, campaigns, creatives, messaging, etc., they are
    ready to roll out personalization in their customer acquisition initiatives. For
    example, a company can pre-define its website, browsing experience, and product
    recommendation for each customer segment. When a visitor fitting a specific segment
    comes onto a website, the company can automatically present the right shopping
    experience to them.
