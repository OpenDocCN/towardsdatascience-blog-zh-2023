- en: I always felt intimidated to write functions in R, since I was so comfortable
    using out-of-the box solutions that come with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
    When I started coding in Python, I found myself writing more and more custom functions
    to replicate my favorite `dplyr` functions from R into Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Learning how to write functions in Python has made me a better programmer in
    R, too. It’s helped me automate my work and ensure reproducibility. The most common
    use case I have for custom functions is to generate multiple plots in R.

    type of visual (like a bar chart) for different variables. For example, I formerly
    worked for the Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, during the height of the pandemic.
    Our data team was tasked with producing reports for his daily Covid press briefings
    that covered daily case, death, hospitalization, testing, and vaccination rates.
    We had the same chart format–bar chart– for each of these variables. Instead of
    repeating the graph code each time for a different variable, we automated the
    reporting process by writing a custom function to loop through the variables and
    produce the charts. This way, we just had to pull in the data each day and run
    the script of code to generate new graphs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2\. Stepping stone to building a dashboard:** Once you have automated the
    reporting process, it’s a natural progression to turn your report into a dashboard
    for an interactive experience. R has a great dashboard library, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/),
    that makes it easy to build a web application directly in R language. When you
    already have a custom function for generating plots, you can easily use the same
    function in your dashboard code to allow for users to select the variable of interest.'

- en: '**3\. Create a DIY facet wrap for** [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/)**:**
    One of my favorite features of `[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)` is
    using `facet_wrap,` where you can generate multiple subplots in one view. It’s
    a simple line of code in `ggplot2`. Unfortunately, there’s nothing like this for
    Plotly yet so I had to recreate it with a custom function.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I acknowledge that we can now use `ggplotly()`to create an interactive version
    of `ggplot2` graph with `facet_wrap`. But I personally have found poor performance
    issues using `ggplotly()`, and choose to custom build everything directly in Plotly
    instead.
