- en: Two years ago, I conducted a fascinating research project at Spotify as part
    of my Master’s Thesis. I learned several useful ML techniques, which I believe
    any Data Scientist should have in their toolkit. And today, I’m here to walk you
    through one of them.

    deciphering its inner workings. *My goal was to understand what made users satisfied
    with their music experience.*

    understanding the *underlying* factors that contributed to their happiness (or
    lack thereof).
