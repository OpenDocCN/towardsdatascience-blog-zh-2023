- en: We can think of data as if it were water and companies as towns. Just as a town
    grows as the population grows and needs more water to serve its residents, a company,
    as it gets bigger, requires a ready to consume data to support its operations.
    Such companies require a data pipeline system that acts like the pipes and infrastructure
    that bring water to homes in a town. In our data analogy, data engineers are the
    people who build and maintain these data pipelines. It is quite straight forward
    for regular array or table like data, however, it is a bit more complicated when
    it comes to spatial data.

    attributes. These attributes allow us to establish spatial relationship; also
    known as [geospatial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_topology).
    Even though two tables don’t have primary keys and foreign keys, we can still
    join them if they both have the spatial attributes. If we visualise the spatial
    attribute, we have a map!
