    and it will require a lot of work. But if you’re willing to put in the effort,
    this article will help you be more strategic about how you spend your time and
    energy. By sharing my own personal experiences, I want to try and help you cut
    through the noise and the marketing fluff that surrounds the industry. Because
    data science is such a hot industry, there are a lot of people trying to sell
    you stuff (courses, equipment, data, certifications, etc.), and in my experience
    this makes it really difficult to know which advice to trust, and which to ignore.'

    My aim is simply to give an honest account of my personal experience getting started
    in the field, in the hope that it helps you on your journey.
