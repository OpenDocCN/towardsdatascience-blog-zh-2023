- en: I have been spending some time recently compiling datasets and reading up on
    research on my home country of Albania, attempting to understand it from a data-driven
    lens. In addition to my own anecdotal experiences, I wanted some systematic method
    of analysing the country’s social, political and lived contexts. One aspect of
    Albania that recently piqued my curiosity were street names and their patterns.
    Looking online, I could find no pre-existing dataset that looked at how the roads
    and streets of the country are named, so I set out to create and analyze one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this story, I am going to be using Open Street Map data to analyse gender
    distributions in street names in Albania’s capital Tirana, as well as other historical
    or geospatial patterns. To do this, I’ll also use **pandas**, **seaborn** and
    a mapping library called **contextily** for prettier maps. This first part will
    focus on gender and street names, but I will be working on a part two looking
    at years of activity as well as areas of contribution over the next few weeks.

    Since the data did not contain a variable classifying names according to their
    gender, and there is no straightforward way of matching names in Albanian to a
    particular gender using code, I used my own knowledge of the language to hand-label
    about half of the dataframe’s rows. The column contained one of the following

    in Tirana, with men names comprising about 71% of the names. This situation is
    not unique to Albania: [2% of Paris’ streets are named after women](https://www.fodors.com/world/europe/france/experiences/news/why-are-all-the-streets-in-france-named-after-men)
    and in [Rome the number is 3.5%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-04/mapping-the-sexism-of-street-names-in-major-cities).
    In these major cities, part of the reason is that city councils which make these
    decisions historically tended to be overwhelmingly male and white. Indeed, only
    an average of [36% of local government members across the world are women](https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Womens-representation-in-local-government-en.pdf),
    with many countries falling significantly short of even this value: for instance
    only about 25 countries have a 40% women representation in local governments.
    That being said, the most recent Tirana city council legislature has a 50–50 men
    to women percentage, which is a step in the right direction.'

    to OpenStreetMap the **residential** tag is “used on roads that provide access
    to, or within, residential areas but which are not normally used as through routes”.
    “**Living**” streets are also very common, defined as roads that “have lower speed
    limits, and special traffic and parking rules compared to streets tagged using
    residential”. These are the two types of streets that dominate in Tirana even
    though they are not main streets, but rather narrower and with less traffic. So,
    it could be interesting to look into the processes of how they get named.

    had names such as “Tirane-Durres” signifying the two urban centers they were connecting
    or simply highway codes such as “SH1”. Given that, I labelled these streets as
    “Other”.

    few discrepancies in the proportions of women’s names, with areas like no. 4 having
    almost 10% of streets named after women and no. 8 having 0.08%. On the other hand,
    two of the areas (12, 14) had no streets named after women. Again, it would be
    interesting to look into the decision-making processes behind these naming choices.
