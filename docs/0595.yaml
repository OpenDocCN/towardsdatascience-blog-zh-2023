- en: Coffee is a marvelous beverage that, like tea, requires some amount of steep
    time to extract the goodness. This steep time or water contact time needs to be
    balanced with the flavors drawn out of the coffee. In espresso, this is particularly
    challenging because water is flowing through the coffee at pressure in a shorter
    steep time than other brew methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a theory that a higher water contact time will cause a higher extraction
    in espresso. Some have argued against this notion, but like many things, this
    theory is testable. The key is a good Design of Experiment (DOE), so let’s design
    an experiment and collect some data to start answering the question.

    of coffee extracted into the cup, called **Extraction Yield (EY)**. This is the
    primary variable we are trying to measure.'

    this experiment, you could see a rising extraction yield as grind went smaller
    until some peak, after which extraction yield would drop. One may conclude from
    such an experiment that longer water contact time doesn’t lead to higher extraction,
    and the conclusion would be flawed.

    one could use a single grind and do 3 different flow profiles. This would control
    for the extraction rate changing due to the particle distribution.

    push the water to the edges as the water comes into the basket contributing to
    side channeling. The DE has a [unique water dispersion](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/water-distribution-for-espresso-cd361bc0734)
    due to the water dispenser which causes water to come in slightly faster on the
    left side than the right.

- en: To reduce the water input variable, we can use some [spent coffee](/the-coffee-bean-is-not-homogenous-sifted-salami-espresso-5b861bfbfbb7).
    Spent coffee is not impacted by channeling as easily because it has no CO2 and
    little extractible solubles. So we can make a mix of a single coffee grind and
    use multiple flow profiles.

    can be better understood.

    as I have for previous tests. However, I thought I could use the opportunity to
    get a little data before the larger experiment. The grounds came from multiple
    spent pucks, and I mixed them together thoroughly. Then I aimed to pull a 2:1
    shot split into two cups. However, the first shot ran a little longer, so I hit
    the same ratio for the other two.

    notion that more water contact time is better (i.e. a slower flow rate).

    much steam as the effects of [steam](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/steam-pre-infusion-for-espresso-a-summary-1c58c65a937a)

    4 ml/s were a little longer. This is normalized by EY.

    This holds true throughout all of the shot ratios, and this supports the idea
    that longer water contact times extract more coffee.

- en: Coffee extraction in espresso is challenging as there are so many variables
    influencing each other. I hope this experiment helps shed light on how a single
    variable can be isolated and examined. This experiment shows that longer water
    contact time causes higher extraction, and previous thinking about contact time
    was conflated with the effects of channeling in finer ground espresso.

    be an interesting experiment to conduct. I’m not sure how other variables might
    conflate the measurement.
