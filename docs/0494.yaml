    merely by referring to their companies as “data-driven” or “data-informed.” These
    days, leveraging data in the decision-making process of your organization is no
    longer cutting edge; it’s the default.

    strategies and measurable decisions remains a challenge for many. This is where
    entrepreneurial data practitioners can make a real contribution to the success
    of their teams, which is a powerful motivator for many of us—and even more so
    in times of economic uncertainty.

    To grow, a business needs not just to retain existing customers but also to acquire
    new ones. Doing so effectively can make the difference between success and stagnation.
    In a comprehensive overview, [Ivy Liu](https://medium.com/u/71fa5614d897?source=post_page-----f552739afd15--------------------------------)
    explains how data scientists can drive customer acquisition and support marketing
    efforts by “launching experiments, monitoring performance in real-time, and quickly
    iterating based on market feedback.”'

    The rapid growth of algorithm-powered applications can be a cause of anxiety for
    smaller and less resource-rich businesses. [Anastasia Reusova](https://medium.com/u/6a4ac211e98b?source=post_page-----f552739afd15--------------------------------)’s
    latest post is a powerful antidote: it stresses that there are still many insights
    to draw just by analyzing raw data and making the most of signal-based scoring,
    with no ML models involved.'

    a range of strategies data scientists can deploy to reduce some of the inevitable
