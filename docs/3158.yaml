    forever. As long as you’re committed to continuous learning and growth, you’ll
    find yourself grappling with new concepts and ideas years (even decades!) into
    your career.

    a year since the launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has certainly gone mainstream—and
    so has confusion and misunderstanding about its inner workings, potential benefits,
    and current limitations. [Mary Newhauser](https://medium.com/u/6b27bdb820b9?source=post_page-----d04d60663098--------------------------------)’s
