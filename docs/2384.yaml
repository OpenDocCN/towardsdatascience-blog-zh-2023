    to enhance the way they treat and manage data. Any attempt to structurally enhance
    data management capabilities will require a minimum amount of centralization,
    if only to discover the current state practice across the organization. A common
    trend is to name a Chief Data Officer, with [a survey finding](https://www.wavestone.us/insights/data-and-analytics-leadership-annual-executive-survey-2023/)
    that >80% of Fortune 1000 organizations now report to have a CDO in place.

    defines new responsibilities, changes authorities, and requires funding might
    be sensitive and therefore tricky. I’ve spent over a decade accompanying emerging
    Chief Data Officers on their respective journeys. I have the battle scars to show
    for it, but also a few lessons learned. In the remainder of this article, we’ll
    review the typical challenges that accompany the launch of a central data team
    as well as the practical actions you can take to manage these risks.

    in many different ways. It may include the launch of a Chief Data Office, kick-off
    of a data (governance) council, enhancements in centrally driven policies and
    standards, and centrally provided resources to execute specific data governance
    processes.

    I have witnessed up close. In the first case, the strategy of the organization,
    a global top 100 insurance organization with over 50k employees, was very aggressive.
    The newly incoming CDO had a history of “getting it done,” which had been part
    of the reason behind his appointment. His plan was to define a list of activities
    that were classified as “data governance activities.” Then, with the descriptions
    in hand, people were identified across the organization that were already executing
    such activities, initially under the guise of assessing the current state. Of
    the people that ended up being identified, sometimes data governance made up their
    entire job, and sometimes only a small part. For example, someone could be doing
    data quality work as part of a marketing pipeline process.

    to move a substantial share of these people into the central team. Of course,
    this led to instantaneous revolt by business and functional teams where these
    people were positioned. They had shown goodwill by participating in the maturity
    assessment, only to see their team members, often critical components of their
    respective operations, being reassigned. The new CDO quickly found himself in
    a hostile situation and achieved virtually nothing for the remainder of the first
    year.

- en: Another case study comes from a global bank, where the global Chief Data and
    Analytics Officer (“CDAO”) launched a transformation program to created a curated
    data lake. The CDAO was wary of creating a data swamp, so she insisted on a strict
    certification process. The promises of the program were strong — teams could submit
    requests to upload their data into the lake, and a central team under the CDAO
    would take care of its ingestion, labeling, and quality control, as well as access
    provisioning, so that business and functional teams could focus on analyzing the
    data and building analytical models. However, demand soon exceeded capacity and
    the average processing time to get data into the lake surpassed 1 month on average,
    and business teams grew frustrated as the central data team became a bottle neck.
    Despite good intentions, a major reset was needed (where my team — coming in as
    the above-described situation worsened — helped with analyzing tooling that could
    automated data governance processes in the ingestion pipelines).

    to avoid bloody fights over resources, a large regional retailer used a targeted,
    use case-driven approach, analyzing resourcing needs and gaps based on a common
    set of ~25 data roles. These roles included personas like data owner, data steward,
    data modeler, data scientist, data engineer, system owner, process owner, domain
    data steward, data architecture, and a few more. The next step involved discussing
    these roles with business and functional teams, identifying which roles they already
    had and where they faced challenges, for example in terms of having the right
    expertise and technology. When common pain points and opportunity areas were identified
    where a central team could effectively supercharge business and functional teams,
    this was immediately welcomed. The completion of the business case to get the
    initial, albeit small, team funded was quick and easy.

    and culture campaign alongside the launch of her new data governance operating
    model. The new operating model came with a lot of new terminology and responsibilities
    that were new for the employees, and we believed that this could cause confusion
    and anxiety. Among other initiatives, we organized an “Ask me Anything” session,
    where anyone in the organization — which counted well over 25k employees — could
    anonymously submit questions that would be answered live. In addition to many
    practical ones, a lot of sensitive questions were asked, such as “How do these
    new responsibilities impact what I get paid?”, “This is the 3rd new operating
    model in 3 years — do we really need another?”, and “My team leader thinks this
    is nonsense — what can I do about this?” Anonymously collected feedback afterwards
    in combination with anecdotal comments indicated that this transparent approach
    alleviated personally felt concerns and encouraged buy-in across those people
    that were impacted by the revamped responsibilities.

    Chief Data Office adopted an automation-first mindset. A reference architecture
    for a newly implemented cloud-native data platform was created with a few enabling
    foundations: a data product approach, strict interoperability standards, and a
    data management hub. This meant that anything that was moved onto the platform
    *by definition* was automatically governed. That is, only what qualified as a
    data product was allowed to be stored on the platform, ensuring that (product
    and data) ownership was defined. The combination of interoperability standards,
    the common storage patterns inside the platform, and the data management hub (which
    included a data catalog) drove nearly fully automated metadata management. Although
    this did come with a substantial upfront investment to get the foundations right,
    it avoided a situation where the central data platform team needed a large number
    of analysts and engineers to operate the platforms and its data products.'

    complexities and sensitivities. However, through effective communication, stakeholder
    engagement, focused training, and a measured approach, only centralizing where
    there is a clear business case to do so, these challenges can be managed effectively.
