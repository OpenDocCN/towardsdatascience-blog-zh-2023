    a Data Scientist](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-scientist-938d917370b9)
    looks like. What you may not realize if you’re new here is that *two* Data Scientists
    share this blog, and our work days and roles differ quite a bit. Leah, the author
    of our previous article is a Senior Data Scientist, while I’m (Ray) a Chief Data
    Scientist.

- en: The role of a Chief Data Scientist (also known as Data Science Manager at some
    companies) looks very different from organization to organization. For example,
    many of my peers in similar roles have a team that is dedicated to a specific
    business line or product. In contrast, I run an enterprise-level team that works
    with almost every business line in the entire organization.

    to my peers. My peers may have one client, while I have many. They may get to
    do more data science, while I get to learn about and interface with a variety
    of business areas. All in all, I love my work, and I get a good mix of hard and
    soft skills.

    me as a Chief Data Scientist managing an enterprise-level team.
