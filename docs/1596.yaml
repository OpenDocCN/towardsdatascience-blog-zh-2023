- en: The two pillars of data science—statistics-backed analysis and code—come with
    a whole range of constraints. Structure your query the wrong way, and you might
    mess up an entire pipeline. Apply a formula incorrectly, and the results of your
    test might no longer reflect reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working within constraints doesn’t have to feel rigid or limiting, though—on
    the contrary. A nimble data professional often needs to lean into their creativity
    while still working within a predefined set of parameters. This holds true in
    our day-to-day workflows, in the way we learn new skills, and in how we set ourselves
    up for a successful data career.

    recommender systems to finding project ideas for your portfolio. What they have
    in common is a fresh outlook on questions and challenges that many in the field
    might consider settled. If “we’ve always done things this way” is a sentence you
    tend to scoff at, you’ll likely find something right up your alley in this week’s
    selection.

    After announcing the death of the dashboard three years ago, [Taylor Brownlow](https://medium.com/u/cdc63fa2a06e?source=post_page-----d84f0e85a668--------------------------------)
    revisits this ubiquitous, occasionally useless, sometimes indispensable fixture
    of data teams to promote a more nuanced view not just of dashboards but of the
    way data professionals produce and communicate meaningful insights: “Changing
    *how* we work is much more difficult than adopting new tools.”'
