    bug within it on the first try, it is impossible to train a model that is the
    right one on the first try.

- en: Those who have some experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning know that
    you often have to **spend a lot of time choosing the right hyperparameters of
    models**. These hyperparameters are for example learning rate, batch size, and
    number of classes in output, but these are just some of the most common, a project
    can have hundreds of such parameters.

    and at some point **keeping track of all the tests done is very hard**.

    by hand in an Excel sheet and write next to it the result of each experiment,
    the loss value for example. Later I “evolved” and started writing configuration
    files for the hyperparameters, in which I put various values that I wanted to
    test. I used to write custom Python functions that would read those values and
    put them into the training function. A YAML file is basically a…'
