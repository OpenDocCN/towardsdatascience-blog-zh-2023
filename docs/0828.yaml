    I talked about the Input > Output > Outcome framework, and how “output” was the
    central piece, but not necessarily easy to define — just because you want it to
    be moved by your inputs, but at the same time, you need to have a causal link
    with your outcome.'

- en: User activation metrics fall under this category of metrics. “Activation” is
    the third stage of the Pirate metrics framework designed by Dave McClure (the
    famous AAARRR framework — Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral,
    Revenue), and it is usually defined as when your user passed the first set of
    frictions, started using your product, received some value from it, and is now
    more likely to be retained in the longer term.

- en: Measuring activation is important because it helps you understand how well your
    product is resonating with new users and whether you are effectively getting them
    to become “active” users. It is the very first step toward user loyalty — this
    is the stage where you know if your users are likely to stick around for the long
    haul. If activation is low, it can indicate that there is a problem with the product
    or the onboarding process, and it may be necessary to make changes to improve
    the user experience and increase activation.

    showcase the product’s value for them, but you want this small action to have
    a causal link with retention (however you define it).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with any ‘leading’ indicator, the causality piece (“doing action Y leads
    to long-term retention”) is hard. You usually start with observational data, and
    traditional data analysis might not give you the full picture, as it can overlook
    confounding factors that can impact activation/retention.

    notice that 70% of users that upload at least one workout within the first week
    of signing up are still engaged with the app a year later, vs 40% if they don’t.
    This can be a first idea for an activation metric.

    the example above, you had to have the idea to look at who tracked their workouts.
    This is where quant meets qual, and when your ‘user acumen’/common sense comes
    into play. Or your networking skills if you want to ask the help of other subject
    matter experts.

    look into too many of them, just because as the adage goes: “if you torture the
    data long enough, it will confess to anything” (Ronald H. Coase). The more actions
    you select, the more likely you will find something, but you will be at high risk
    of it being a false positive. So sticking to what makes sense and is not too far-fetched
    can be a good rule of thumb.'

    that you believe you would be able to move. If you come up with something too
    complicated/niche, you might not be able to move it, and so this will defeat the
    purpose of the whole exercise.

    make sure they’re accurate. That’s where propensity score matching can come in
    handy — to understand if the correlation you found previously could actually be
    causation. Although this is not the only solution existing, and it does require
    to have a bit of knowledge around your users (which might not always be the case)
    it can be relatively easy to implement and can give you more confidence in your
    result (until further triangulation, with more robust approaches such as A/B testing).

    can predict the self selection. If you are missing key features, and the bias
    from unobserved characteristics is large — then the estimates from PSM can be
    very biased and not be really helpful.

    help having a more data-driven approach for metric selection, get you started
    on ‘what to focus on’, until you get to the stage of running A/B testing and have
    a better understanding of what drive long term success.
