    we talked about multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as the first neural network model
    that could solve non-linear and complex problems.

    set. While single-layer perceptrons had a simple learning rule that was guaranteed
    to converge to a solution, it could not be extended to networks with more than
    one layer. The AI community has struggled with this problem for more than 30 years
    (in a period known as the “AI winter”), when eventually in 1986 Rumelhart et al.
    introduced the **backpropagation algorithm** in their groundbreaking paper [1].

- en: In this article we will discuss the backpropagation algorithm in detail and
    derive its mathematical formulation step-by-step. Since this is the main algorithm
    used to train neural networks of all kinds (including the deep networks we have
    today), I believe it would be beneficial to anyone working with neural networks
    to know the details of this algorithm.
