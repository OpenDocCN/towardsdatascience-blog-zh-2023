- en: '[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), the open-source AI community for machine
    learning practitioners, recently integrated the concept of tools and agents into
    its popular [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library.
    If you have already used Hugging Face for Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer
    vision and audio/speech processing tasks, you may be wondering what value tools
    and agents add to the ecosystem. Agents add an arguably major level of convenience
    for the users — let me explain.'

    from English to French. In such a case, I would need to do some research to find
    a good model, then figure out how to actually use that model and finally code
    it up and generate the translation. But what if you already had a Hugging Face
    expert at your disposal that already knew all of that? In other words, you would
    just tell the expert that you want to translate a sentence from English to French
    and then the expert would take care of finding a good model, coding up the problem
    and returning the results — and the expert is much faster than what you and I
    could do. That is exactly what agents do! We describe what we want to the agent
    in plain English and then the agent looks into the tools available in its…
