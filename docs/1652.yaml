    poor data quality costs a staggering $3.1 trillion to the U.S. economy annually,
    not to mention the impact it can have on an organisation’s competitive standing

    in complexity, leading organisations are seeking practical solutions to help them
    navigate data entropy and ensure that their expensive software and data platform
    investments are yielding the best ROI possible. Data Observability emerged as
    a solution to Data Entropy, by providing a smooth 360 view of the health status
    of data assets and how they interact with and within the platform data practitioners
    can finally invest their time in value creating tasks that propel the business
