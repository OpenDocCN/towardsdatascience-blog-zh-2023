    complexity is that it can lead to a lot of “technical debt”. This is when there
    are parts of the system that are no longer serving a purpose but are kept around
    because they are too difficult or time-consuming to get rid of. It is essential
    to periodically review your data platform and cut unnecessary parts to keep it
    lean and efficient.'

    software available on the market, and in most cases, purchasing an off-the-shelf

    when weighing the pros and cons of each approach are: cost, time, quality and
    scalability. While in certain cases it might make sense to build something custom
    to solve a very specific problem, it often leads to the accumulation of technical

    data observability is a concept that comes from software and, before that, from
    control theory. The idea of software observability — think of companies like Datadog
    and New Relic — is to help software engineers better understand what’s going on
    inside their applications and monitor their health status. This can now be applied
    to data. So, observability can be defined as the ability of organizations to gain
    actionable insights regarding the health status of their data. As I’ve explained
    in [this blog](https://medium.com/the-observatory-by-sifflet/data-quality-monitoring-is-dead-say-hello-to-full-data-stack-observability-f73cac27ea52),
    data observability has four main pillars:'

- en: The best way to conceptualise Data Observability is to think of it as an overseeing
    layer to a modern data infrastructure aimed at allowing data practitioners to
    see into and comprehend the increasingly complex web of data assets that characterise
    a modern enterprise data platform. By connecting to each compartment of the data
    stack from ingestion, ETL/ELT, modelling, warehousing, all the way to BI/analytics,
    reverse ETL, ML etc a data observability solution should be able to provide an
    actionable insight into the health status of data assets at each stage of the
    pipeline.

- en: Data Entropy is expensive. According to a research done by [IBM](https://www.lightsondata.com/estimating-cost-poor-data-quality/),
    poor data quality costs a staggering $3.1 trillion to the U.S. economy annually,
    not to mention the impact it can have on an organisation’s competitive standing
    and reputation. Is Entropy in data inevitable? Is it a direct result of scale
    and expansion? Should it be embraced? Yes, yes and yes. Amid the inevitable rise
    in complexity, leading organisations are seeking practical solutions to help them
    navigate data entropy and ensure that their expensive software and data platform
    investments are yielding the best ROI possible. Data Observability emerged as
    a solution to Data Entropy, by providing a smooth 360 view of the health status
    of data assets and how they interact with and within the platform data practitioners
    can finally invest their time in value creating tasks that propel the business
    forward.
