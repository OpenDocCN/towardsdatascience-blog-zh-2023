    given in the later stages of the screening process. The first rounds assess your
    knowledge of statistics (hypothesis testing, etc.) and often include practice
    coding questions (SQL, R, etc.). If you need to brush up on your skills in these

    description of what they expect you to do with the dataset. For example, in my
    take-home assignment for a data science position in Deliveroo, the task was to
    analyze the performance of their RGR (Rider Gets Rider) referral program compared
    to other marketing channels. Then to assess if it was successful and, if not (ha!),
    what are some important factors we should consider changing. The last step of
    the task involved presenting a summary of the information to senior non-technical
    stakeholders and suggesting next steps, such as gathering additional data

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most companies, the interest is around numerical attributes. These can be
    anything, depending on the company. For our Deliveroo example, it would be the
    number of referrals, or for a company like Netflix, it could be the number of
    videos seen. For most companies, they will be monetary (i.e., revenue based).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we want to better understand these numerical attributes. We can use descriptive
    statistics and plots to that end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    attributes'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We now want to identify our KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). KPIs are the
    subset of descriptive statistics that can be meaningful to business stakeholders.
    For example, there are better choices than IQR for a KPI. The most frequently
    used statistic for a KPI is the average (average number of referrals by rider
    or average number of videos seen per user). You will be expected to select the
    appropriate statistic for your KPI(s) based on the distribution of the data. So
    if there are outliers, you can choose the 95% trimmed mean, or if the distribution
    is highly skewed, you can select the median.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to walk the business stakeholders through these decisions. Explaining
    that because of extreme outliers, the mean has a value of $10000, and so a much
    better choice is the 95% trimmed mean with a more representative value of $120
    showcases that a) you have identified the outliers and b) that you know how to
    deal with them!

- en: 3.2 Adding dimensions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our analysis is still too high level. We need to add the categorical attributes
    to the mix. You can think of them as the dimensions of our KPIs. For our Deliveroo
    example, we can split the median referrals per rider by city or month. Dates are
    one of the most frequently used columns for dimensions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some categorical attributes may have many rare classes (a class is a unique
    value for categorical attributes, such as “Boy” and “Girl”). These rare classes
    can be combined or reassigned. We can also group in a similar way numerical attributes
    to create new categorical dimensions. For example, using quantiles, we can group
    revenue into four buckets (or bins). But try not to overcomplicate the assignment;
    unless there is good reason, refrain from binning numerical attributes.

    uniform decline of 15% across all cities?

- en: 3.3 Root Cause Analysis
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Root cause analysis aims to identify the underlying factors that contribute
    to a problem. Let’s see how that works using an example. Imagine an assignment
    where **Total Revenue** was down by 25% compared to last month. You added the
    categorical attribute **City** as a dimension and observed that the difference
    came almost exclusively from New York and London. **Total Revenue** has stayed
    the same month on month for other cities. First, we will decompose Total Revenue
    into its two components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Total Revenue = Total Number of Orders * Average Order Value**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking at the (fictional) data, for both cities **Total Number of Orders**
    was up by 9%, but **Average Order Value** was down by38%! Okay, now we are getting
    somewhere. We can also examine the funnel that users go through. For example,
    if orders are down, we can first examine how many visitors we had, how many of
    them added a product to the basket, how many proceeded to the checkout page, and
    finally, how many have confirmed their order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the above depends on how much data we will have available. But we
    can only work with what we have, so do not worry if any of the above steps are
    not possible due to data limitations. But make sure you add them as potential
    data sources when you go through your analysis’s recommendation and next steps.
