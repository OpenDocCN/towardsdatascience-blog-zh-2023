    a lot about about [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
    (LLMs). Probably the most well-known example is [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/),
    which more specifically is an LLM-based chatbot developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
    ChatGPT is known among developers to offer a powerful help related to coding.

    and many of our conversations were related to Python coding. They led me to think
    that if one doesn’t know too much about Python, Bard would not be a good teacher.
    Its¹ replies helped me a lot, but I quickly noticed that I had to be careful when
    talking to it: many of its replies were misleading, difficult to understand, or
    even incorrect. So, while it indeed helped me answer some Python questions, it
    was rather clear to me that Bard was not ready to teach Python beginners, not
    yet.'
