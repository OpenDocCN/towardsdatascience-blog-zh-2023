- en: Since return to the office, I have had some time to compare the Kim Express
    and the Decent Espresso machine [again](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/steam-pre-infusion-for-espresso-a-summary-1c58c65a937a).
    The caveat is that the Kim Express is at work. So I have slowly been taking data
    over the past few months, and I have some results ready to share. I am pleased
    that I have bridged the gap between the Decent and the Kim, but there is still
    room.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, I have been doing multiple modifications on my shot profile for the
    Decent, particularly the [Pump & Dump profile](/the-birth-of-the-pump-dump-espresso-profile-on-the-decent-9f8a438f1151).
    This profile has been the most influential while at the same time, I have been
    working on better [water input](https://medium.com/@rmckeon/advanced-shower-screens-for-espresso-7336e67df768).
  prefs: []

- en: Originally, I was using a [paper star on top](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/iterative-design-of-top-paper-filters-for-espresso-20d261bbc519)
    of the puck, and I have since shifted to modifying the shower screen to restrict
    water to the center 25% of the puck. I have also applied these changes to the
    Kim, so my shots have been getting better across the board.

  prefs: []

- en: There is some delay (30 minutes to 3 hours) between grind and shot for the Kim,
    and I have done some experiments to understand how grind age affects the shot
    taste. There is a difference, but it also allows for higher extraction.

- en: The Kim Express needs a finer grind. With the change in shower screen, I have
    dropped my water temperature from 116C to 105C, but the flow is so fast in part
    because it is so even.

    a similar bubble.

- en: Between these two machines, I have learned more than I ever thought was there.
    The Kim’s big advantage is that the grouphead is inside the boiler, and this gives
    some heating advantages. Additionally, when you open the lever to let water into
    the group, the piston chamber allows water to vaporize, and I wonder if this makes
    steam pre-infusion more efficient.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main downside of the Kim Express is that if something goes wrong in the
    shot, you can’t slow it down. Once you pull the lever down, the shot’s fate is
    sealed whether it is going to channel or not. There are some minor things one
    can do, but the flow control potential of the Decent makes it very attractive
    to make the Decent outperform the Kim.
