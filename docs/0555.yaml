    [1] have been gaining popularity in recent years for being continuous, fully differentiable
    models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). They have the ability
    to solve complex problems in fields like engineering, science, finance, and many
    more. But as with any field of Machine Learning, there are startling challenges
    to overcome, for which there are no answers in the literature yet. In my work
    with PINNs, I have come across a variety of hurdles and have developed a set of
    hints and tricks to help improve their performance.'

    from working on diverse problems and have consistently resulted in improved performance.
    I want to share these insights with you, to help you in your journey with PINNs.
    This guide will hopefully provide you with practical suggestions to help improve
    your models and achieve better results.
