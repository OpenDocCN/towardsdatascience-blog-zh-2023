    range of data roles, you may have heard about all these roles. A few years ago
    a new role appeared together with the rise of transformation tools like dbt: the
    [Analytics Engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people) role. In
    January 2021 [Atlan](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2021/01/the-top-5-data-trends-for-cdos-to-watch-out-for-in-2021/)

    are craze or trend, my feeling is that **the range of data roles is set to continue
    expanding.**'

    is simple: **Data Strategists are at the crossroads of data individual contributors,
    strategic consultants and team managers.**'

    since the beginning of 2023, layoffs are on the rise in the tech industry. With
    budgets allocated to data teams being reduced, data teams tend to be of a smaller
    size. Yet they are still expected to deliver a similar amount of work. Leaders
    have to do investment tradeoffs between data analytical vs. data engineering vs.
    data…
