- en: exception handling is a process of writing code to catch and handle errors or
    exceptions that may occur during program execution. This enables developers to
    write robust code that continues to run even in the face of unexpected events
    or errors, rather than crashing completely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When an exception occurs, Python searches for a matching exception handler.
    The handler code will execute and take appropriate actions, such as logging the
    error, displaying an error message, or attempting to recover from the error. Overall,
    exception handling helps make Python applications more reliable, maintainable,
    and easier to debug.

    improvement, debugging, or additional error-checking measures. They allow Python
    to gracefully handle erroneous situations and continue executing the script rather

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working with exceptions in Python, it’s advised to include both `else`
    and `finally` clauses in your `try-except` blocks. The `else` clause allows you
    to specify what should happen if no exception is raised, while the `finally` clause
    ensures that certain cleanup operations are always performed regardless of whether
    an exception occurred [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)[[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exception-handling/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, consider a scenario where you want to read data from a file and
    perform some operations on that data. If an exception occurs while reading the
    file, you might want to log the error and stop processing further, but you still
    want to close the file properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the `else` and `finally` clauses would allow you to do just that - process
    the data normally if no exception occurs, or handle any exceptions appropriately
    while still closing the file in the end. Without these clauses, your code would
    be vulnerable to resource leaks or incomplete error handling. Thus, they play
    essential roles in creating robust and reliable programs.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, we first attempt to open the file “file.txt” for reading using
    the `with` statement, which guarantees proper closing of the file object automatically
    upon execution completion. If either `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError`
    occurs during file I/O operations, the respective except statements get executed.
    **For simplicity**, we simply print error messages and exit the program if the
    file is not found.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Otherwise, when no exceptions occur within the `try` block, we proceed with
    processing the file contents in the `else` branch. Finally, the cleanup operation
    ensured by the `finally` block closes the file regardless of whether an exception
    was raised earlier or not [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).

- en: Defining Custom Exceptions
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Python, you can define custom exceptions by subclassing built-in exceptions
    such as `Exception` or any other class that inherits directly from `Exception`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this, you need to create a new class that inherits from one of these base
    exceptions and add attributes specific to your needs. You can then use your newly
    defined exception class throughout your code, just like you would use any other
    built-in exception class.
