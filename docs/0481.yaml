    I’ve written about [what ChatGPT is](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/chatgpt-is-the-worlds-best-chatbot)

    are already taking shape in the real world.

    has reached people much faster than any resources on how to use it well or how

    larger than ever before (not only ChatGPT…'
