- en: Shapley Values is a concept derived from cooperative game theory in Economics
    that assigns a value to each player in a cooperative game based on their contributions
    to the game. In the field of machine learning, this concept has been adapted into
    the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework, which is an effective technique
    for interpreting the workings of a model.

    checking out my [previous article](https://medium.com/@shreya.rao/economics-illustrated-shapley-values-7d33df43ada8)
    on the math and intuition behind Shapley Values. Even though it’s been modified
    for machine learning purposes, understanding its underlying principles can be
    helpful.

- en: The SHAP framework is similar to Shapley Values in that it calculates the individual
    impact of features in a game (aka a machine learning model). However, machine
    learning models are non-cooperative games, which means that features don’t necessarily
    interact with each other as they do in cooperative games. Instead, each feature
    contributes independently to the model’s output. While the Shapley Values formula
    can be used, it can be…
