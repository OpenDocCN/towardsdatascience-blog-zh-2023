- en: My maternal grandfather, Skip, was always a farmer in my eyes. Tragically, my
    mother passed away from leukemia just a month after my birth in 1988\. Being the
    first grandchild in the family, Skip and I were very close. As a child, I spent
    my days riding on the arm rest of tractors and combines during annual wheat harvest
    — and when I became a teenager, I worked the farm as a summer job myself.

- en: Yet, Skip’s earlier life was a far cry from the farming world I knew him for.
    Before I entered the scene, he had delved deep into academia, completing his PhD
    coursework in Statistics at Texas A&M, College Station, by 1972\. Soon after,
    he embraced a professorship at the University of Maryland, finalizing his thesis
    in 1974\. His groundbreaking research aimed at predicting and pinpointing safety
    and material risks in industrial settings. This monumental task demanded years
    of effort. He had to manually gather a decade’s worth of accident reports from
    diverse companies, process the statistics manually, and then convert these insights
    into [punch card instructions for the university’s computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era).
    Securing time on that computer was *not* immediate; it required reservations made
    weeks or even months ahead. A single coding error could mean starting from scratch,
    potentially stalling his research by several months.

    and branch off into entrepreneurship. But the desire to leverage statistical inference
    was baked into everything he did as a farmer — I just didn’t realize it as a child.
    To my child’s mind, Skip was doing “office work” as he called it — but in reality
    he was leveraging IT to forecast and secure financing to meet his operational
    expenses, optimizing chemistry in fertilizers to increase crop yields, developing
    strategies to reduce uncertainty in his cash flows through trading futures on
    the Chicago Commodity Exchange all on a [TRS 80 he bought at Radio Shack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80)
    with 16 KB of RAM connected to a dot matrix printer. Agriculture can be a terribly
    low margin business — and Skip’s bet was he could use statistics to level the
    field a bit.

    farming does not fare all too well when forced to skip a generation — and today’s
    input cost are more unforgiving than ever — economy of scale becomes the only
    way to compete profitably — and so most small to mid-size farmers from Skip’s
    generation were bought out and consolidated — but that happens gradually — little
    by little (at least it did for us).

- en: I, of course, grew to appreciate the strong connection between statistics and
    agriculture. I still remember the annual visit from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/topics/data)
    meticulously sampling crop yields (on every farm, ours included) as part of their
    [National Agricultural Statistics Servic](https://www.nass.usda.gov/)e. Which
    provides, in my opinion, one of the great unsung and ongoing data projects in
    history — helping generations of farmers make “data-driven” decisions — before
    that was even a buzzword. But I found even more appreciation for all that Skip
    did decades later as I embarked on my own Analytics and Data Science career —
    my own second act after spending my 20’s and 30’s serving and globetrotting as
    a US Army Officer. I often reconnect with him over the phone asking him to recount
    how they used to run regressions or simulations or how they controlled for random
    sampling “back in the day”. And then occasionally telling him about how they are
    doing it now to gauge his excitement as I described to him concepts like machine
    learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning — — it is somewhat science fiction
    to him — but he *loves* hearing about it — even if it isn’t quite *real* to him
    this late in life.

    new technology for himself — not just hear me talk about it. What if we could
    make a business plan to launch a hypothetical new farm in under 40 minutes? I
    could do it using ChatGPT 4 with the Advanced Data Analysis enabled, over screen
    share to his iPhone — we’d collaborate together to build it.

    him 2 years to do on his own ‘back in the day’.” Yes, I recognize there is a lot
    more *we could do —* and the “simulation” is far from perfect. (For example, we
    do not delineate between % of crops devoted to soybeans vs wheat.) But for 40
    minutes? Even I was impressed. And this is the promise of Gen AI — democratizing
    data science, encouraging experimentation, and speeding up the ability to develop
    all within the palm of your hand. Allowing a grandfather and his grandson an opportunity
    to reconnect over some statistics and leveraging technology in new and unexpected
    ways.
