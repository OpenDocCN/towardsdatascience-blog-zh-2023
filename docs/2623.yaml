    copies are introduced into the workflow. This post will focus on optimizations
    that ensure that this won’t slow the average workflow down.

    defensive copies to avoid side effects to protect against inplace modifications
    later on.

    introduce side effects when modifying the result, e.g. `df` would be updated as
    well. Hence, a defensive copy is performed in `reset_index`.

- en: The previous section illustrated many methods where a defensive copy is no longer
    necessary. CoW guarantees that you can’t modify two objects at once. This means
    that we have to introduce a copy when the same data is referenced by two DataFrames.
    Let’s look at techniques to make these copies as efficient as possible.

- en: The copy is triggered if the data that is backing `df` is referenced by another
    DataFrame. We assume that our DataFrame has `n` integer columns, e.g. is backed
    by a single Block.

    modify the DataFrame inplace without modifying another object. A naive approach
    would be to copy the whole block and be done with it.

- en: This would set up a new reference tracking object and create a new Block that
    is backed by a fresh NumPy array. This Block doesn’t have any more references,
    so another operation would be able to modify it inplace again. This approach copies
    `n-1` columns that we don't necessarily have to copy. We utilize a technique we
    call Block splitting to avoid this.

- en: Internally, only the first column is copied. All other columns are taken as
    views on the previous array. The new Block does not share any references with
    other columns. The old Block still shares references with other objects since
    it is only a view on the previous values.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is one disadvantage to this technique. The initial array has `n` columns.
    We created a view on columns `2` till `n`, but this keeps the whole array alive.
    We also added a new array with one column for the first column. This will keep
    a bit more memory alive than necessary.

- en: This system directly translates to DataFrames with different dtypes. All Blocks
    that are not modified at all are returned as is and only Blocks that are modified
    inplace are split.

- en: The indexing operations we looked at don’t generally create a new object; they
    modify the existing object inplace, including the data of said object. Another
    group of pandas methods does not touch the data of the DataFrame at all. One prominent
    example is `rename`. Rename only changes the labels. These methods can utilize
    the lazy-copy mechanism mentioned above.

    `replace` or `fillna`. These will always trigger a copy.

    which violates CoW rules. This is one of the reasons why we consider keeping the
    `inplace` keyword for these methods.

    into a different direction. That said, this only pertains to columns that are
    actually changed; all other columns are returned as views anyway. This means that
    only one column is copied if your value is only found in one column.

    to improvements in your code. Many methods will get faster with CoW, while we
    will see a slowdown in a couple of indexing related operations. Previously, these
    operations always operated inplace, which might have produced side effects. These
    side effects are gone with CoW and a modification on one DataFrame object will
    never impact another.
