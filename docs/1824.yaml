    organization. They provide intent, focus, direction and a framework for the model
    building process. Always ask the users why they need an ML solution, rather than
    the how. Focus on the functionality of the project’s goal before building.

    By understanding the reasons and intent of a project, it helps identify the direction
    of what you want to build. Lack of communication or clarity on the “why” is a
    common reason why projects don’t make it to production. This creates bottlenecks
    where development may stop — or even need to be restarted.

    to both good delegation, project scoping, and communication. It helps if teams
    work in parallel by divide experiments and model development. Their tempo hinges
    on communication between individual teams, time boxed tasks, and clearly defined
    roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the need to perform multiple tasks with limited manpower. However they may also
    have more streamlined communication and coordination, which can enable them to
    move faster and iterate more efficiently.

    operational tempo.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The team was small and lacked a balance of skills and experience to handle these
    new projects. The scope of the projects were often vague, responsibilities undefined,
    and there were several communication issues. The smaller team size meant they
    had limited resources, affecting their ability to work on multiple aspects of
    the models simultaneously.
  prefs: []

    The marketing client hired additional data engineers, machine learning experts,
    and project managers with experience in managing AI-based projects. They then
    suggested each role and responsibility was clearly defined, and also that each
    project had a well-defined scope and timeline.
  prefs: []

    on different parts of the machine learning projects became a breeze for our client.
    I noticed clearly defined roles, improved how they tested and benchmarked models,
    and improved their communication. It really reduced confusion and boosted teamwork,
    speeding up their MLOps tempo and development time.

    or stakeholders. Data available in some geographic regions cannot be removed from
    one region and used in another. Some models in some geographic regions require
    more documentation.

    GDPR and other regulations may limit the use of features used to build models.
    Teams need to implement proper data management practices and potentially adjust
    their models to maintain privacy, which can affect the overall operations tempo.

- en: Certain industries regulations may also require additional model validation
    or third-party audits. Model governance and documentation for these audits adds
    to the development time. It is critical that these needs are scoped prior to working
    with a business unit or client. These regulations may even ban the use of certain
    models.

    loan defaults. They had business in both North America and in the EU. The problem
    lay in the difference in data regulations.

    were requried to have a stricter audit process — from the data to the models they
    used.

- en: Their work was slowed down because they had to follow various international
    data protection laws. Transferring data was limited, and they had to create more
    paperwork. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European law, required
    them to modify their models and strictly manage data to ensure user privacy.

- en: To comply with these rules, I watched our team help the client created separate
    cloud environments. For European data, they built machine learning models in a
    GDPR-compliant cloud. Meanwhile, they stored data for North American customers
    in another cloud and used it for models targeting those customers.

    require additional model validation, audits, and comprehensive documentation.
    Some these regulations even limited the types of predictive models our client
    could use. This required our team to develop custom, compliant solutions — which
    required extensive research and constant model compliance reviews.
