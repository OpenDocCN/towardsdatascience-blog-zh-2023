    time. When we talk about geospatial, we think of [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
    (GEE). This service has several advantages. It hosts many large data collections
    that span over 37 years. All computations run on Google’s powerful cloud infrastructure.
    What’s more, it is free for non-profit projects. With GEE, we can study the [land
    use land cover](https://medium.com/geekculture/monitor-land-use-changes-with-google-earth-engine-65cd15e10c6c)
    (LULC), the [vegetation](https://medium.com/p/909a2ad51a48), the local climate
    ([here](https://medium.com/p/c6aa77fecdb1) and [here](https://medium.com/p/ae21261854d6)),
    and even [the crop production in the US](https://medium.com/p/9cfd14813e99) for
    free.

    or Python is a must. Secondly, we need to be familiar with many geospatial concepts,
    such as image collection, geometry, and satellite bands. Thirdly, its asynchronous
    request-response pattern takes some getting used to for newcomers.

- en: This poses a small challenge for many data scientists. More often than not,
    they just want some values for a set of coordinates quickly, such as the soil
    pH or the mean land temperature. As of this writing, they would need to go through
    a fair bit of coding because GEE provides no RESTful API. Wouldn’t it be nice
    if we can fill that gap ourselves (Video 1)? Our APIs should wrap up some common
    GEE computations and offer HTTP…
