    Well-defined metrics help you make sure you stay on track to achieve the goals

    the organization stray away from its original goal, and ultimately although you
    have people who did their job pretty well (they reached the OKR you set on the
    metric you created), the organization is not at all in the state you were expecting:'

    — the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet — but when magni­fied across

    email is the number one priority for your team. One solution could be to make
    it as hard as possible to contact the email support. For instance, to “hide” your
    support email address on a random page of your website, to make it very complicated,
    and display it in a .png, so that people have to manually type it again. Most
    likely this will drive down the number of contacts, but that might have other
    unintended consequences (e.g. increasing the number of ‘negative’ social media

    (a great book I recommend for anyone interested in A/B testing, don’t let the
    title scare you away!), the authors explain that you should build “Objective Experiment
    Criterion” (OEC) whenever you run an experiment. An OEC is a compound metric taking
    into account the metric(s) your experiment is supposed to move and the metric(s)
    you don’t want your experiment to move negatively (e.g. cost metrics, guardrail
    metrics, health metrics) — that will ultimately allow you to create a binary decision
    rule to decide if your experiment is successful or not. The concept is really
    interesting and can work well for experiments. Said this, compound metrics can
    be hard to use to track a process — you need to understand their underlying logic
    to be able to understand the movement of the metric and debug them — so ultimately
    you end up tracking all the different metrics that create the compound.
