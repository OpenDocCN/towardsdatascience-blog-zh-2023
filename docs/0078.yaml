- en: During a recent department meeting, I brought up a pain point of our data team
    to our VP. Our customers don’t seem to know or care how much of a burden their
    requests put on us. Most people who’ve worked in data have had a conversation
    with a stakeholder where the ask is days if not weeks worth of work, but the expectation
    is that this is trivial. Furthermore, after putting in substantial effort, we
    find out that the original request was either unnecessary or unrelated to our
    customer’s actual problem. Essentially, my thesis is that there’s a misalignment
    of incentives between data teams and our customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My VP had a different point of view. He suggested that our business partners
    should focus on what they do best, and when they need data to execute on their
    vision, they should put in the request to us. They shouldn’t have to make the
    call as to whether what they need is “too expensive” or “too time-consuming.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And my VP isn’t wrong. I doubt any of us who have utilized an internal service
    organization like HR, legal, IT, or procurement have thought about the complexity
    or cost of our requests. How long could proof of income for a loan possibly take?
    What does it take to get my broken laptop replaced? These concerns are wholly
    absorbed by their respective organizations, and the business as a whole runs more
    efficiently that way.

    I’m not suggesting that data as a space is generally more difficult, more valuable,
    or more complex than these other support functions; quite the contrary, I think
    because the space is relatively immature, a lot of processes and concepts are
    still missing or half-baked. On the whole, I think data teams tend to have weak
    operating models supporting questionable value propositions. And at the core,
    there are two flaws: the data model and the analytics value proposition.'

    and his constant push for businesses to prioritize data modeling is one of my
    core beliefs. To be clear, there’s always data modeling; whether that’s a shared
    exercise (when done in a warehouse or lakehouse) or an individual one (in a single
    report or dashboard) is the fundamental question. The lack of core data models
    leads to multiple understandings of the business, a situation that leads to misalignment
    across teams.
  prefs: []

- en: Furthermore, without well-defined semantics, the relationship between the data
    and the business processes they underpin becomes extremely difficult to understand.
    Even experienced analysts can spend vast amounts of time trying to tease out misalignment
    between processes, data, and analytical outputs. When most companies are working
    with dozens or hundreds of sources, many of which are externally-maintained, and
    all of them have independent (operational) data models, is it any wonder that
    we frequently fail to paint a coherent picture of the business?
  prefs: []

- en: Proper data modeling is a complex exercise amongst product (when applicable),
    operations, and data teams. Most businesses have under-invested if not outright
    ignored this critical element of developing valuable data assets. Instead of making
    collaborative decisions up front, we make individual decisions on the back end;
    engineering and analyst time gets eaten up re-inventing the wheel for each asset,
    report, and dashboard. We as data professionals feel this pain, and by extension,
    our customers do through poor (or non-existent) time-to-value.

    They bring (often but not always very reasonable) assumptions about what the data
    *must* look like to the table, and because they don’t live in the tables and pipelines,
    they’re frequently very wrong. Even when our customers know what data assets exist,
    they don’t necessarily have the expertise to understand whether or not they can
    be applied to their specific use-cases.
  prefs: []

- en: The more intractable problem is that we as an industry have a very tenuous grasp
    on what analytical outputs are valuable, and we have even less insight into how
    much value any given output produces. We “know” that there’s something valuable
    about making data available to the business (look at the success of FAANG+), and
    there’s research suggesting companies that leverage data are more effective than
    their peers², but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood.

    about whether or not the report they want will provide any real business value.
    They can ask for reports all day long, and nobody is the wiser as to whether or
    not that was a good use of the data team’s time. This lack of a feedback loop
    is frustrating for data teams, and it can leave customers feeling like they didn’t
    get what they asked for: not because the deliverable was wrong per spec, **but**
    **because the requested deliverable was never able to generate value in the first

    [has an excellent article on alignment](https://www.winwithdata.io/p/alignment-pedantry)³
    that covers this better than I ever could, but I’ll take a crack at adding some
    thoughts. Data assets are deeply mired in context that only experts can successfully
    navigate. The numbers are never just the numbers, which is why analytics is deceptively
    hard. It’s like trying to follow a map, only to realize that sometimes there are
    roads where none are depicted, and there aren’t any where there should be. “Oh
    yeah. Old Main was decommissioned two years ago, but we decided to leave it on
    the map so you would understand why Main Street runs the way it does.” Travelers
    would be doomed.'

- en: And we end up with these sketchy maps because (to mix metaphors) the sausage-making
    is especially messy. Analytics is a very complex process by which 1) the business
    takes information (bookings, billings, purchases) 2) that then gets encoded as
    data by products and enterprise systems (a record on an account object, a record
    in an inventory table) 3) that ultimately gets extracted to an analytical data
    store and re-assembled as information. This last step is always more art than
    science.
  prefs: []

    the way. We fail to understand important distinctions in the way different sources’
    object models interact when we try to combine them. Humans will adjust to slight
    deviations in business processes over time, but our analytics systems will not.

    institutions are a part of this, but we can do a lot of field work in the meantime.
    In much the same way that product companies conduct experiments to link features
    to value (churn reduction, expansion), data teams should start making investments
    in experimentation frameworks. We need to know that our data products are wanted
    (from customer feedback) and valuable (from metrics).
