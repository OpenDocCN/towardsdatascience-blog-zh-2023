- en: As I began writing this article on September 30th of last year, another month
    came to an end, but this is no ordinary month. For many Mexicans, it represents
    an ongoing concern, as it is well-remembered that this particular month has often
    witnessed our country being shaken by earthquakes, often of significant intensity.
    This article aims to provide readers with valuable insights into the seismic history
    of Mexico through data analysis and visualization. While it doesn’t make predictions
    or formulate policies, it offers a deeper understanding of seismic trends and
    patterns. By gaining this knowledge, readers can be better prepared for seismic
    events and contribute to informed decision-making regarding construction and disaster
    preparedness.

    19th**. On this date in 1985, Mexico experienced the most devastating earthquake
    on record, with a magnitude of 8.1 on the Richter scale. Approximately 40,000
    people lost their lives, and nearly 4,000 were rescued from the rubble of countless
    buildings and houses that crumbled due to the tectonic movement.'
