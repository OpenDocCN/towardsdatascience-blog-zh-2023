    exists already a well-known “framework for carrying out data mining projects which
    is independent of both the industry sector and the technology used.” [4] Besides
    that, other relevant concepts such as TDSP, SEMMA, or KDD aim to provide comparable
    models that outperform each other on several details. However, it was of interest
    to take a step back to identify (meta-) requirements relevant to process models
    focusing on data science. The requirements were collected via a survey from April
    2019 to February 2020, cover both scientific and practical aspects, and, thus,
    address the first research question [2]:'

    9 professors as well as 13 practitioners and scientists with relevant theoretical
    and practical experience in data science. Based on that, it was examined the extent
    to which the related process models fulfill the requirements collected previously.
    The below table offers an overview of the results of the investigation by the
    specific requirement and process model. Filled Harvey balls indicate that a requirement
    is addressed by the respective process model, half-filled ones that a requirement
    is at least mentioned, and empty ones that a requirement is neither mentioned
    nor addressed. [2]

    all previous, well-known models did not meet all defined requirements, it was
    of interest to introduce a novel concept that allows researchers as well as practitioners
    in business & industry to use the DASC-PM to structure data science projects in
    a phase-orientated way. However, the authors claim that the DASC-PM should not
    be considered a finished deliverable, but more as a framework that can be continuously
    improved through scientific and practical discourse.
