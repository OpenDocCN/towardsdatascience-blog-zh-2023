    edge as a data professional. It will make your “non-analytical” decisions better
    informed (from “project prioritization” to “how to present your findings”) and
    help you formulate a long-term goal. And that’s truly an edge — not a lot of data
    professionals are taking this step back to design long-term goals (and even fewer
    are delivering against these long-term goals).
