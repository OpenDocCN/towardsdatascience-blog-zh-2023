    lack clear and intuitive explanations of how logistic regression works. Instead,
    they usually strive to be either practical, by showing how to run models, or as
    mathematically complete as possible, and as a consequence, basic concepts get
    buried underneath a forest of matrix algebra.

    angle and fitted probability to have an infinite slope at the mid-point. Therefore,
