    background in computer science but had gained data science skills through micro-credentials
    and online courses. Their ability to demonstrate the data science skills we needed
    was enough to allow her to expand her job description to include data science

    a university degree because they could do everything we asked of them, and then

    shift in hiring policy, along with increased industry involvement in developing

    developed in post-secondary institutions with input from industry and the government.
    These types of micro-credentials will hold the most weight from potential employers
    because not only are they from a post-secondary institution (which, let’s face
    it, is still important in today’s society) but they’ve also been signed off on
    by industry leaders and government officials who are working to fill a skill gap.
    Additionally, you should focus on completing micro-credentials that have a capstone
    project. Capstone projects not only provide [evidence of learning](https://trainingmag.com/designing-micro-credentials-for-the-future-of-work/)
    but can also be added to your professional portfolio.

- en: After completing your micro-credential, you want to immediately begin putting
    to use the skills you learned. The pace of micro-credentials can often be quick,
    meaning you may not retain as much information as you might when working on a
    course over 16 weeks in a typical university setting. Therefore, now is the time
    to begin building your professional portfolio, building data science products
    to sell, sharing your data science knowledge on blogs, and even doing pro-bono
    data science work for local businesses.

- en: The next step (which may be completed in tandem with the previously discussed
    step) is to begin developing your resume and learning how you’re going to market
    your skills. Because your learning path is slightly different than what other
    job candidates will have, you want to demonstrate how you’ve leveraged your micro-credential
    into personal projects, pro-bono work, and a track record of authority in the
    area of data science. These items, the physical work experience (whether paid
    or unpaid), are what employers are looking for in someone who they will need to

    informational content on LinkedIn. Marketing your skills this way is a great way

    you immediately able to hit the floor running if they hire you. Not only does
    this demonstrate your teachability and ability to self-start, but it also shows
    that you won’t back down from a challenge and can get things done. My co-worker
    began speaking up about taking on small data science-related aspects of projects
    after they completed their micro-credential, which gave our employer the chance
