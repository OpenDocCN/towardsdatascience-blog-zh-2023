    the world. It’s called [Beyond Transparency](https://beyondtransparency.org) (publicly
    available at this link) and it consists of case studies showing the successes
    and obstacles of the Open Data policies in the early 2010s. As the title hints
    at, providing accessible and free datasets is a move towards a more transparent
    government, but not only. The book talks about how this data spurred innovation,
    improved government efficiency and encouraged new civic habits, such as more citizen
    participation. Data professionals, including engineers and data scientists, also
    formed their own solutions around these new datasets, building better models and
    apps. For some examples of these new civic tech ecosystems, check out the [Building
    a Smarter Chicago](https://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-1/building-a-smarter-chicago/)
    chapter and the analytics work that arose from websites like Data SF or Chicago
    Data Portal! Another personal favorite chapter: [The Data-Driven City](https://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-4/beyond-open-data-the-data-driven-city/),
    on how collecting 311 calls allows NYC to model emergency services and resource

    data practices across 4 fronts or “pillars”: governance, capabilities, availability

    on **existence** of a particular element (e.g. a data protection framework), **elements**

    and applicability of a specific framework across a country). The study also tracks

    government. For instance, having better procurement data allows citizens to analyze
    where and how money gets spent in all stages of a project or push for more equitable
    allocations. Similarly, having transparent lobbying data and asset declarations
    allows for more accountability for political integrity. Climate information allows
    the public to stay informed on aspects such as biodiversity, emissions or vulnerabilities.

    Furthermore, real-time healthcare data was only available in around 50% of countries
    and even fewer published information on the number of available beds. For some
    of these countries, this type of data was only made available for the first time
    during the pandemic, which allows for countries to start building on it for better
    healthcare reporting in the future.

    and accessible COVID-19 vaccination data. 57 countries also did not offer machine-readable

    at global level (recall the average overall index: 38/100). As we already saw
    in this story, having fully formed laws around open data is simply essential.
    In addition to the research being done by Global Data Barometer, there’s other
    repos that track new legislation around open data issues around the world. The
    [State of Open Data](https://repository.opendatapolicylab.org) by The Gov Lab
    is one of them. So, take a look at it for laws by sector or type of collaboration!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Broadly, though, the Global Data Barometer report illuminated the practical
    challenges in adopting these laws, including data gaps or inaccessible or unavailable
    data. One striking example we looked at was the publication and management of
    health data, especially in emergency situations such as COVID-19 where having
    timely information is crucial. This example, however, also showed how new challenges
    can also spur data to promote transparency and allow citizens to stay informed
    which is very promising! Overall, the report points at very specific areas for
    each country to focus on, offering context-specific strategies for better data
    collection while still providing a big picture view of the current challenges
    with open data.
