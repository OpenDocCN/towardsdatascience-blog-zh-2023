    by AI Village @ DEFCON 31, and the experience was intriguing, to say the least.
    The challenges, particularly those involving pixel attacks, caught my attention
    and are the main focus of this post. While I initially intended to share a simple
    version of a pixel attack I performed during the competition, the goal of this
    post is to also delve into strategies for strengthening ML models to better withstand
    pixel attacks like the ones encountered in the competition.

    object detection product. The concept is simple yet revolutionary — customers
    snap a picture of the desired item, and it is delivered at their doorstep a few
    days later. As the brilliant data scientist behind the scenes, you’ve crafted
    the ultimate image-based object classification model. The classification results
    are impeccable, the model evaluation metrics are top-notch, and stakeholders couldn’t
    be happier. The model hits production, and customers are delighted — until a wave
