    day that stands out. It was the first day of the multivariate analysis module.
    This class was new at the time, and to our surprise, the professor decided to
    do something different. Instead of going through the agenda for the semester,
    he closed the lights and announced that today we would learn about the module
    differently — by watching the pilot episode of the series “Numb3rs”.

    algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset with the goal of maximizing prediction
    accuracy on new unlabeled data. For example, an algorithm can be trained on a
    labeled dataset that includes characteristics of houses (square footage, number
    of bedrooms, etc.) and their corresponding label (sales price) with the goal of
    creating a model that predicts with high accuracy the sales price of a new house,

- en: Create a dataset that is unique by row for the entity you want to cluster. So
    if you want to cluster customers, each row must represent a different customer.
    For each one of these rows, you will have attributes (columns) that describe specific
    characteristics, like revenue in the past year, favorite product, number of days
    since last purchase, etc.

- en: Compute the similarity between each row and all others in your dataset (based
    on the available attributes). So we will have a similarity value between the first
    and the second row, the first and third row, the second and third row, and so
    on. The most frequently used similarity functions are distances. We will go through
    these in more detail in the case study of the next section as they are better
    explained using an example

- en: Input the similarity matrix into a clustering algorithm. There are many available
    in R and Python, like k-means, hierarchical, and PAM. Clustering algorithms have
    a simple purpose. Assign observations into clusters so that observations within
    a cluster are as similar as possible and observations between different clusters
    are as dissimilar as possible. In the end, you will have a cluster assignment
    for each row (observation)

    the other three. It is a good practice in clustering to standardize all attributes
    to the same scale before computing the similarities. This is done so that attributes
    on a larger scale do not overcontribute (**Assault** is in the hundreds, whereas
    the other three attributes are in the tens). Fortunately, the similarity function
    we will use takes care of that, so we do not need to do any rescaling at this
    stage.

    (**cluster** package) in R to compute the similarity matrix. To be more specific,
    Gower uses dissimilarities as a distance function, but the concept is the same
    (instead of maximizing similarity, we minimize dissimilarity).

    (numerical and categorical attributes). Another advantage is that Gower scales
    all distances to be between 0 and 1 (attributes on high scales do not overcontribute).

    the number of clusters is pretty straightforward. We will run the PAM algorithm
    using the Gower similarity matrix we computed in the previous step, and in each
    run, we will select a different number of clusters (from 2 to 10). Then, we will
    compute the Average Silhouette Width (ASW) for each run. We will do that using
