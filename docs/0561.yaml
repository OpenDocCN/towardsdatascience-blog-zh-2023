    over the last few years, AI and machine learning have come to the forefront. The
    last decade was also a decade of immense growth. Capital was aplenty and companies
    had long runways to learn and perfect their craft. Yet [research](https://hbr.org/2022/07/how-well-does-your-company-use-analytics)
    points to the failure of organizations to leverage data effectively. The economic
    climate has now changed and companies are now more focussed on [profitability](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/02/investors-have-flipped-their-weighting-of-growth-versus-profitability/)
    and operations. The cost of failure is too high now and companies thacanto leverage
    data will have a competitive edge. AI and data-driven decisions can be of help
    here by bringing clarity to discussions, separating facts from opinions, and accelerating
    time to market.

    To them, efficiency, profitability, growth, etc. are a means to an end and not
    the other way around. So the leadership needs to be very clear on the purpose
    the company is driving towards. That purpose then needs to be translated into
    specific goals, and then further distilled to exact metrics that need to be measured.
    One of my consulting clients, a roadside assistance company did this particularly
    effectively. Their purpose was to ensure that no customer was stuck on the road
    for more than a certain time depending on the service zone. This was then converted
    into a goal for each organization, for example, Finance budget allocations were
    optimized to achieve this objective, Customer Service would aim for first-call
    resolution, and Sales were incentivized not only on target achievement but NPS,
    so that they sold the right products to the right customer. Finally, the executive
    dashboards had all these metrics and in the annual planning process targets were
    set for these P0 metrics.'

    Having a clear set of problem statements brings alignment across the entire organization.
    These need to be simple at the company level e.g. “Increase operating margin by
    50bps”. This helps everyone align to what needs to be solved for and puts a data
    point behind it. The overall goal can be then disaggregated for functions and
    they can decide what levers they want to pull. For example, marketing might create
    a problem statement “Change media mix model to maintain MQLs while reducing marketing
    spend by $xx”'

    agree that data-based decisions are essential, they continue to rely on their
    gut. Executives should take data-based decisions even if sometimes this is against
    their gut. And they should communicate this as well so that the entire organization
    feels that they are a data-driven organization. One of the most effective sales
    executives I have worked with understood the power of data and ensured his team
    made the best use of companies data capabilities. Two of his go-to methods were
    to never make a decision without having at least some supporting data and framing
    very precise statements for the data team, for example — “I want to understand
    the impact of 5% and 10% price increases on our volumes and margin.”'

    but in reality, it can be very subjective. Organizations often have very fuzzy
    and sometimes diverging definitions of even fundamental metrics such as growth,
    churn and cost to serve. A shared understanding of what metrics are to be used
    to measure the organization and their exact definitions is a must. Lacking this,
    data becomes an igniter of debate rather than a tool to drive decisions. I have
    found that one of the most effective ways to achieve this is to have a company-level
    data dictionary with precise definitions and data sources.'

    where several teams work cross-functionally, often with slightly overlapping mandates.
    If multiple people or teams own a single thing, no one ends up truly owning it.
    Strong ownership and process are paramount. Everyone should have clarity on who
    owns and provides each metric. While there can be debates around what is the right
    way to define a metric, once debated, the number that the owner of the metric
    provides is the truth. Similar to the point about, having an owner identified
    in the corporate data dictionary is paramount.'

    a dozen sources of truth in a large organization. Every team creates its version
    of the truth, which suffices its use case. This is a recipe for creating confusion
    in the organization. Often this is considered a tactical data topic, whereas it
    is an executive leadership topic. It is essential to have a set of golden tables
    that house the core data such as financials, go-to-market metrics, and people
    metrics. This is one of the biggest causes of lost efficiency in analytics, with
    analysts spending countless hours trying to reconcile data, and executives spending
    precious time debating the data instead of formulating strategies to succeed in
    the market.'

    easier to explain, and easier to use for the entire organization. Engineering
    teams lean towards shiny objects, but the business goals and the use cases should
    define what technologies need to be implemented and not the other way around.
    Technology today is moving at a very rapid pace and innovations abound. This has
    led to situations where we have [hammers looking for a nail](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/podcast-episode-ai-hammer-search-nail).
    I have seen this leading to numerous organizations having multiple and complicated
    data stacks with little interoperability. It is best to keep the stack as simple
    as possible, sometimes Power Pivot running on top of a database is all one needs.'

    it becomes tough to make good use of it. This context usually sits in the business
    and the specific functions. The data infrastructure needs to enable analysts and
    even business folks in functions to make use of data. Tools such as Alteryx can
    make it easy for non-technical teams to build their ETLs, and tools like Tableau
    can help them make their reporting repeatable. This is not only a question of
    technology, but of culture, and the philosophy of how an organization uses data.'

    in an organization. It is a topic that does not get much love from either executives
    or the data teams. In time though it becomes one of the limiting factors on speed.
    For example, it is common for new hire analysts to take months to ramp up as they
    wade through the messy data; and still, spend weeks finding and cleaning data
    for an analysis that should take a few hours.'

    and should not be. The micro-decisions finally add up. There are hundreds of decisions
    that can take place in an organization every day. E.g. Pricing decision on a small
    deal, software plug-in selection for a process workflow, prioritization of backlog,
    etc. Clear decision rights and a culture of using data to inform can lead to massive
    efficiencies. Employees feel empowered and can move quickly. But this is hard
    to achieve, and in my experience, it is an organizational transformation topic
    that needs to be leadership driven and highly cross-functional in nature.'

    through action. Fostering small changes can have a big impact. One of the most
    effective ways to do so is by creating rituals and embedding them into ways of
    working. A simple but powerful one could be that if a decision is needed in a
    meeting the requester needs to send analyzed and aligned supporting data before
    the meeting as a pre-read. Similarly, I have observed, starting operational reviews
    by looking at a set of metrics is highly effective in decision-making. Amazon’s
    [memo and press releases](https://thehustle.co/02162021-amazon-writing/) are great
    examples of such artifacts.'

    between data and functional teams they lose the insights in translation. Joint
    business+data teams that are working towards the same problem statements are most
    effective. Having clear problem statements such as “How can we improve conversion
    rates with the same marketing dollars?” can help align teams to the same goal.
    Then the business teams need to coach data teams on the context and data teams
    need to coach the business teams on the art of the possible but also the limitations
    of analytics techniques. Data and technology teams need to have a seat at the
    table to be effective. Organizations where they are a backend function lose on
    squeezing the value out of their data.'
