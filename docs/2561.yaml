- en: During a dreary stretch of June and July in Boston, it seemed to rain every
    time my family had planned to do something fun. We started to wonder if we were
    stuck in a rainy pattern and asked, “Does the fact that it has rained a lot for
    three days straight, make it likely to rain tomorrow?” I realized that this question
    is easy to answer using available weather data.

- en: This article presents the US weather datasets I used, the Python/pandas program
    I wrote to analyze the data, and the results. In short, yes, a stretch of rainy
    days strongly predicts more rain. And, surprisingly, the longer the stretch of
    rain, the more likely it is to rain the next day. The results also prove a prediction
    from global warming models — there is more rain now than in previous years.

    under the [Access](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc%3AC00313#OnlineAccess)
    tab is wrong and points to an older version. The new dataset is [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/coop-hourly-precipitation/v2/)
    and covers the period 1940 to 2022\. HPD has fine granularity with hourly precipitation
    amounts from more than 2000 [collection stations](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/coop-hourly-precipitation/v2/station-inventory/)
    across the US. The data files contain all years for one station in each CSV file.
    I used only the daily totals, but the hourly information might be useful for future
    analysis. (See the [Constraints](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc%3AC00313#Constraints)

    the [equivalent](https://www.weather.gov/chs/coop_equipment) rain amount. So all
    data in HPD includes liquid rain, melted snow, and everything in between such
    as slush and hail.

    that could be used for similar analysis. LCD contains far more information than
    just precipitation and also includes temperature, sunrise/sunset, air pressure,
    visibility, wind speed, fog, smoke, monthly summaries, and more. LCD is updated
    daily, so it contains yesterday’s data. To use it you need to decode the [Integrated
    Surface Dataset (ISD) station numbers](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-hourly).

    You can run the code very quickly with 1/100 of the stations for debugging, or
    something like 1/3 for an accurate approximation of the results. By the [Law Of
    Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), my tests with
    1/3 (about 600 stations) produced results that are nearly identical to the full
    dataset.

- en: The trickiest part of the code is the look-back on each date to see if it has
    been rainy for a stretch of previous days. The problem is that the data to be
    looked up is within the very same DataFrame, a self-join. It is tempting to use
    a loop over the DataFrame and, for each row, look up previous dates as you go.
    But loops over large data structures are bad style in any programming language,
    *especially* pandas. My code solves this problem by taking a snapshot of the DataFrame,
    creating fields on each row that contain the nine previous dates (and one for
    tomorrow), and then using those fields to join with the snapshot.

    inches to 0.75 and 1.0\. These changes show the same general phenomena of rainy
    days predicting more rain, but without perfect correlation through eight days.
    The definition of “rainy” as 0.5 inches seems to be the sweet spot for predicting
    tomorrow’s rain.

    dryness the next day, but the prediction is not as strong because the chances
    of a dry day tomorrow are very close to each other. The chance of a dry day tomorrow
    is always near the overall mean of 78%.

    earth warms up, it will rain more. The HPD dataset can verify this, at least over
    the past 80 years.

- en: The simple approach would be to take all of the current climate stations (about
    2000) and look at rainfall data during each decade. But there is a potential bias
    with doing that. There are more weather stations now than there were in 1940,
    since stations have gradually been added over the past 80 years. It is possible
    that newer stations have been built in rainy places. If that is the case, newer
    data would show more rain, but only because the overall set of stations is wetter
    than the 1940 set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A more accurate approach is to find the set of stations that had rain data in
    the 1940s, and then use the same stations for every decade. My program can do
    this because it emits the list of stations actually used on each run. So first
    I found data for the years 1940 to 1950, and then re-used the emitted station
    list again for 1950 to 1960, then 1960 to 1970, etc. This is about 840 stations
    with between 400K and 2.5M data points in the various decades.

    Numbers again. But the chart below shows significantly increased rain over the
    same collection stations. This is a remarkable result supporting a key predication
