    speech and linguistic researchers have been curious too, and they‚Äôve explored
    a concept called the **Lombard Effect** (discovered by [√âtienne Lombard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Lombard)).'

    and laughing. Having a good time! To make yourself heard by your friend, your
    brain automatically levels up your voice‚Äôs ***volume***, tweaks your ***pitch***
    and even adjusts your ***speech speed***. What‚Äôs interesting is that we also tend
    to adapt our voice according to the feedback we get from the person in front of
    us and the noise around us to make sure they get the message.

    systems.** What if Alexa or Google Home could speak in a Lombard effect? (A scenario
    already imagined by [SNL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvT_gqs5ETk)).

    [[2](https://dipjyoti92.github.io/TTS-Style-Transfer/)]) explored how Lombard
    style could be applied to Text-to-Speech to improve intelligibility. Their goal
    was to see whether they could train on a voice with Lombard-style recordings and
    improve intelligibility and naturalness. They found that indeed it was a more
    natural way to improve intelligibility than signal processing!

    end (like most hearing aids do), we can make the speech sound clearer right at
    the source!

- en: Hearing aids are amazing pieces of engineering, but they come with their challenges.
    They‚Äôre not always comfortable, can be costly, and some people even opt not to
    use them regularly. But with Lombard-style TTS, the speech is automatically adjusted
    to be more distinct and easy to understand. This could be a game-changer, not
    only for those with hearing aids but for non-native-speakers (See [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016763932100131X)])
    and anyone in a noisy environment!

- en: The works mentioned earlier used datasets with a lot of audio samples for a
    specific voice. What happens when you don‚Äôt have that? How can we synthesize voice
    in a Lombard style without having to record (tiring, time-consuming, and expensive
    for voice talents)?

- en: Voice conversion, the process of transferring somebody‚Äôs voice onto recordings
    of someone else‚Äôs speech, can be applied as a data augmentation approach. The
    idea is to create recordings of the person‚Äôs voice in the Lombard style by transferring
    the speaker's identity onto the Lombard speech recordings.

    we recently presented at the [Clarity Workshop](https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2023-workshop/programme.html)
    at Interspeech 23'', we decided to investigate how we could preserve the Lombard
    effect when doing voice conversion. Indeed, the target speaker information might
    overtake the Lombard effect characteristics and not give us the expected results.
    We want to answer the following question: *Can we preserve the Lombard-speaking
    style responsible for intelligibility during Voice Conversion, while also transferring
    the speaker‚Äôs identity?*'

    key elements of the voice: pitch, volume, and tilt. We then directly give the

    recordings and give them to the voice conversion model to force it to keep them
    in the final recording, while also transferring the voice we want to transfer.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Past studies and our work show that Lombard-style TTS indeed increases speech
    intelligibility in noisy surroundings. While the naturalness might take a hit,
    it is less noticeable in noise and the speakers‚Äô identity is not as affected.
    In our study, we found that the Lombard intelligibility effect is lost with basic
    Voice Conversion but by using conditioning either implicitly or explicitly we
    are able to transfer them better!
