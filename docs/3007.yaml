- en: In today’s information age, we’re inundated with news articles on a daily basis.
    Many of these articles are merely restatements of the same facts, but some contain
    genuinely new information that can have a major impact on our decision-making.
    For example, someone looking to invest in Meta may want to focus on articles that
    contain exclusive information, rather than those that simply reiterate previously
    published data. It’s crucial to be able to distinguish between news that is novel
    and news that is redundant, so that we can make informed decisions without being
    overwhelmed by the deluge of information.

    comes it. Novelty detection refers to the task of identifying new or unknown data
    that differs from previously seen data. It is an unsupervised learning technique
    used to detect anomalies, outliers, or new patterns in data. The key idea is to
    build a model of “normal” data, and then use that model to identify data points
    that deviate from normal.

- en: In the context of news articles, this involves detecting whether an article
    contains new information that is not available elsewhere. To do this, we can perhaps
    develop a baseline of what is known or available, and then compare new information
    to that baseline. If there are significant differences between the new information
    and the baseline, then we can say that the information is novel.

  zh: 最小协方差行列式（MCD）
- en: Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method is a technique for estimating the
    covariance matrix of a dataset. It can be used to create an elliptical shape that
    encapsulates the central mode of a Gaussian distribution, and any data points
    that lie outside of this shape can be considered as novelties (sometimes referred
    as anomalies). The MCD method is particularly useful for datasets that are noisy
    or have outliers, as it can help to identify unusual data points that may not
    fit the overall pattern of the data. ([see example](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/papers/2010/wire-mcd.pdf)).

  zh: 最小协方差行列式（MCD）方法是一种估计数据集协方差矩阵的技术。它可以用来创建一个包围高斯分布中心模式的椭圆形，任何位于该形状外的数据点都可以被视为新颖性（有时称为异常值）。MCD方法对于噪声大或含有离群值的数据集特别有用，因为它可以帮助识别那些可能不符合整体数据模式的异常数据点。（[见示例](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/papers/2010/wire-mcd.pdf)）
- en: MCD can be used to detect novelty in news headlines. While the method can be
    generalized to full articles, our aim is to provide a concise example of applying
    MCD for novelty detection on short texts. MCD is a robust estimator of multivariate
    location and scatter, making it well-suited for identifying outliers in high-dimensional
    data such as text. On a dataset of news headlines, MCD will learn a model of “normal”
    headlines based on covariance. We can then use this model to score new headlines
    and flag those that significantly deviate from the norm as potential novel or
    anomalous stories. The sample code and experiments will illustrate how MCD novelty
    detection works in practice.

  zh: MCD可以用来检测新闻头条中的新颖性。虽然该方法可以推广到完整文章中，我们的目标是提供一个简明的示例，展示如何在短文本中应用MCD进行新颖性检测。MCD是一个多变量位置和散布的鲁棒估计量，使其非常适合在高维数据（如文本）中识别离群值。在新闻头条的数据集上，MCD将基于协方差学习一个“正常”头条的模型。然后我们可以使用该模型来评分新头条，并标记那些显著偏离正常的头条，作为潜在的新颖或异常故事。示例代码和实验将说明MCD新颖性检测在实践中的运作方式。

    represents the semantic meaning of the input sentence, and can be used for tasks

    vectors (each representing a single sentence) in the column vertically to create
