    a concrete example in the data engineering world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a data engineer building a pipeline, which copies a set of raw data tables
    from a transactional data warehouse into a container in the cloud. Following the
    medallion architecture, where data goes through the bronze, silver and gold layers,
    they first clean the data and dump them into a set of bronze-layer tables in the
    designated data lakehouse. Next, they normalize the table in the silver layer,
    as well as establish relationships between them. Finally, they join multiple tables
    together in a view and create new features to represent the business metrics to
    be fed into Tableau dashboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the testing of the dashboards, it is noted that there are missing values
    for a certain column in some records. Business users are concerned as they see
    more than 50% of records with missing data for that column, but they also acknowledge
    that the data may be incomplete at the source. Now, the engineers will need to
    investigate and resolve the problem.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    logic manually on that sample record again to see why the data for that column

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scenario 1: the sampled record contains some unexpected characteristics, making
    their column values excluded from the gold layer. In short, this is a **design**
    problem. In this scenario, a good engineer will discuss these unexpected characteristics
    with the product owner and determine a treatment plan for them. Either they will
    decide that they can safely ignore this subset of the population, as the data
    with these characteristics are not relevant for the business objective; Or they
    will come up with custom transformation logic for them, in order to bring the
    data in.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scenario 2: the column value comes through in their manual transformation,
    this means their perception of the initial data lineage is wrong. In short, this
    is an **execution** problem. The good engineer will go back to check what the
    data pipeline is doing, or what the data lineage actually is. Then they repeat
    the rest of the steps.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a custom treatment for the impacted records (i.e. modify the design), however,
    they make a bigger mess as their perception of the data lineage is incorrect to
    begin with.

    no importance to them. They care about other aspects (perhaps the appearance of
    results), or they don’t care about anything at all. It’s rare for an evil engineer
    to have exceptional knowledge, but if they do, it’s not relevant anyway, as again,
    they care neither for the truth, nor the result.

    where I draw the line between bad and evil:'
