    (x axis) each with a different energy (y axis). This is called the “conformational
    landscape” that the molecule can explore due to motions. The lower the energy
    of a local or global minimum, the longer will the molecule stay in it as it exchanges
    between structures (green arrows). While regular structure prediction methods
    like AlphaFold aim to find the central minimum, which corresponds to the lowest
    energy structure, the holy grail is now in finding the full distribution of possible
    structures and their probabilities. See figure 2 and text for further explanations.

- en: Well, apparently Microsoft’s teams applying AI to science (together with a renowned
    professor, see notes at the very end) might have a first “Yes” as an answer to
    my question. They have just presented their novel “Distributional Graphormer”
    which can predict not just single molecular structures (of proteins, or other
    molecules, or materials) but also actually the multiple alternative structures
    (or “conformations”) that a molecule or piece of material can adopt in 3D. That
    is, the alternative possible arrangements that their atoms can adopt in space.
    Moreover, the new AI model also “understands” that different structures…
