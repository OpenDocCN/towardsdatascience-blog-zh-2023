    burning issue? Questions like this are interesting from a sociological perspective;
    knowing the current trends in people’s opinions can also be interesting for scientists,
    journalists, or politicians. But how can we get answers? Collecting responses
    from millions of people could have been an expensive process in the past, but
    today we can get these answers from social network posts. Many social platforms
    are available nowadays; I selected Twitter for the analysis based on several reasons:'

    to analyze. At least I hope that while having text size limitations, people try
    to share their thoughts in a more laconic way.

    about 450 million active users at the time of writing this article, so it is easy
    to get plenty of data to work with.
