    expert. Having a solid educational background in mathematics, computer science,
    the natural sciences, and statistics provides a strong foundation for understanding
    the underlying theories and algorithms that drive ML models. In addition, acquiring
    practical skills through hands-on experience with various programming languages,
    libraries, and tools is critical for implementing and deploying successful ML
    solutions. [R1, R2]

- en: However, the right set of soft skills can transform a team of capable ML experts
    and turn them into a successful one. These skills complement technical skills.
    [R3] Soft skills are personal attributes and abilities. In the field of ML, soft
    skills are especially important as they enable experts to work effectively with
    stakeholders, clients, and other team members to ensure that the right problems
    are being solved, and the right solutions are being developed and deployed.

    of an activity. A clear view of the target allows working consistently. In ML
    projects, it is very easy to go from one interesting analysis to the next. The
    risk is that you end up somewhere without finding a solution to a real-world problem.
    Working with purpose can help develop meaningful solutions. [R4]'

    contributor to success. It takes self-discipline to correct past behaviour and
    not repeat mistakes. It makes it possible to develop good work habits and maintain
    adequate quality standards. [R5] In the modern workplace, distractions are everywhere.
    Focusing on a specific purpose and keeping your full attention makes it possible
    to achieve quality results within a finite amount of time. [R6]'

    important to be clear about the underlying assumptions, apply logical and rigorous
    reasoning, and come to a conclusion. At the same time, it is also important to
    preserve the mental flexibility to re-question assumptions and revisit conclusions
    if the results look suspicious. In my experience, ML-generated results that look
    too good to be true are often not.'

    can introduce dedicated time for focused work, but this can only enable concentrated
    work if each team member makes the most of the time available. Another aspect
    of time management is the ability to work consistently and set clear priorities
    to manage interdependencies between projects and teams and meet deadlines. Remember:
    you will never finish all you want so make sure you prioritise! [R7, R8]'

    backgrounds, nationalities, and age groups. It is important that each team member
    is able to deal with cultural differences. For example, in our team, English is
    predominantly spoken, but for most of us, English is a foreign language. It is
    important to listen carefully and ask questions until both sides of the conversation
    are sure they have reached a common understanding.'

    expectations on the team are diverse. A deep-rooted learning attitude with a general
    interest in field-specific topics, and content that is loosely related to it,
    as well as other areas where interesting problems are solved, can become a rich
    source of inspiration for problem-solving. This basic attitude can form the basis
    for teams to quickly become familiar with the subject-specific conditions in new
    projects. Incidentally, lunch break discussions also get a lot more fun and interesting!

    testing new methods with unknown outcomes are a part of daily work. ML experts
    have to take the risk that comes with entering unknown territory. Things should
    not go wrong, but they will, e.g. the data is insufficient (quantity, information
    content, quality), the algorithm may not converge, and many more. The team needs
    to be able to stick with a problem when it gets difficult, be able to cope with
    setbacks and keep going anyway. It won’t always work the first or second, or third
    time — ML is hard, and we have to deal with it.'

    comes with a great deal of responsibility: For the data, the team is working with,
    for the outcome of the algorithm applied, and for the unintended results that
    arise for example from bias in the data. It is of utmost importance that ML teams
    acknowledge and are not afraid to take this responsibility. [R10]'

    solutions are complex and often mean that the team has to deal with uncertainties.
    It is important that everyone in the team takes ownership of their respective
    work. Teams with a healthy ownership mindset often have a culture of “if I break
    it, I fix it”. However, ownership requires accountability. Each individual has
    to be accountable for him or herself and must have the space and safety to be
    honest about the results. [R11]'

    value, if it can not be deployed, applied to real-world data, scaled, and maintained.
    A successful team develops end-to-end solutions that are maintainable, scalable,
    and robust. It comes with two aspects: First, the data — data is often messy and
    need a lot of work and care to unveil its valuable information content. Second,
    the software (& cloud) engineering. Here the software engineering best practices
    apply. [R12]'

    after all solve a numerical optimization problem. They take numbers as input and
    will output numbers. Whether the outcome is reasonable or solves the given problem,
    needs to be checked by a team of experienced ML experts.'

    Each team member must have trust in their own competencies and their limitations,
    in order to build trust within the team and work on continuous improvements. Safety
    in this context means: first, within the team, we respect ownership, but actively
    contribute to the success of the ML product. Second, everyone makes mistakes each
    team member feels safe to own their mistakes, correct them and learn from them.
    This enables each team member to be a strong and reliable collaborator.'

    personal and professional growth. There are two facets to this approach: firstly,
    seeking out mentors either within or outside of the team in order to engage in
    active learning, receive guidance, and exchange ideas. Secondly, seeking out mentees
    to provide guidance, e.g. in form of code reviews, discussion of data exploration
    or to challenge ML solutions.'

    has not yet been able to solve. Our job is to explore whether there is a potential
    solution based on the available data, which is an intrinsically difficult challenge.
    To tackle it, everyone on the team needs to have their personal toolbox and be
    able to approach, untangle, and ultimately solve the given problem. This often
    involves applying advanced analytics to complex data sets, developing effective
    algorithms, and finding innovative solutions. This capability enables a valuable
    contribution to the team, the company, and its customers.'

    share the responsibility for good communication. The speaker needs to be able
    to articulate complex technical concepts and results when communicating with collaborators,
    stakeholders, or other experts. [R13] In ML development clear resource and time
    planning can be difficult. It is often called *Data Science* for a reason. Therefore,
    the skill of negotiating resources and deadlines is an important aspect of the
    team''s work. [R14] Often, the data cannot live up to the hopes of stakeholders
    which can lead to friction. Equally important, the nature of teams with cultural
    and educational diversity, different competencies and at times conflicting goals
    can lead to truly difficult conversations. It needs patience, openness to understanding,
    and a healthy amount of empathy to handle such conversations well. [R15] We listed
    here the three major aspects of strong communication necessary for a successful
    ML Expert.'

    its impact on the team, organization, customers, and society are valuable skills
    for an ML expert. This competency, combined with a deep understanding of the interconnected
    intricacies of product development in ML, empowers them to stay focused on the
    big picture, anticipate obstacles, and think several steps ahead. Consequently,
    the expert can communicate with stakeholders and customers with clarity and prioritize
    the most critical areas for success.'

    allocate the right resources, and deliver results effectively. [R17]'

    decisions that positively influence the economic success of a company. An important
    prerequisite is to understand the business problem and the customer needs. Then
    it is a challenge to realize them effectively and in a technically performant
    way. The performance of the technical solution relates to the quality of the ML
    model, and, equally important, to its cost-effective implementation. Strong business
    acumen enables the ML expert to contribute to the company’s profits.'

    he asks for.* It is an important skill to use knowledge and competencies in a
    way that helps the customer in the end. The client should have confidence in the
    ML product and the development team. Customer focus means understanding the customer’s
    needs and developing an adequate solution. [R18]'
