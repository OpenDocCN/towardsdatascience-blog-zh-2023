- en: New York City’s [open data platform](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) is
    an incredible source of information. All public data collected and generated by
    the city is [mandated by law](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/)
    to be made available through the portal, as well as being free for use by the
    public.

    Park squirrel census, and even park ranger reports of aggressive turtle encounters.

- en: Geography, infrastructure, and sociology datasets like these represent real-world
    processes and events. Even if you have no connection to or little interest in
    NYC or urban areas in general, they give you a chance to work with data that looks
    a lot more like what you’ll encounter in a professional role than the likes of
    MNIST or Titanic survivors. Better still, they’re almost as easy to access.

    to use and build some interesting visuals in the process.
