- en: For example, I choose to do all of my mentally rigorous studying (such as anything
    calculus-based) during the morning which is when I’m most energetic and focused.
    The afternoon is reserved for less mentally-taxing studying or other tasks that
    don’t require much brain power (which for me is usually studying data visualizations,
    statistics, or working on my personal projects). By studying during the most productive
    part of my day, I’ve ensured that I’ll be as effective and efficient as possible.

- en: The time of day when you’re most productive is different for everyone. Some
    people work best during the day, while others work best at night. The point is
    to pick the same time every day when you’ll schedule your studying. Not only that,
    but your brain needs to begin to associate a specific time of day with studying.
    This will help you maintain your focus for longer and will have you prepared to
    hit the books the minute your study session starts (as opposed to scrolling through
    your phone for 10 minutes because you need to amp yourself up to study).

    to study data science is also important for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
    For example, today (a Friday), I finished all of my calculus studying this morning

    to-do list for the week, and leaving me an entire half day to relax, catch up

    maintaining a routine. Spending 10–20 minutes looking through your materials and
    trying to find video lectures is a waste of good study time, and a hassle that
    can actually make you resent the time you spend studying. Instead, take 30 minutes
    to an hour every Sunday night to plan out exactly what you’re going to be studying
    each day of the coming week. This should include laying out all of the topics
    you’ll cover in a day (be realistic and don’t overwhelm yourself) as well as queuing
    up video lectures, resources, and the code files you’ll be working on. This is
    also the time to charge your electronics, organize your study space, and maybe
    prepare some grab-and-go study snacks to keep you going.

    more Leetcode challenge. However, this will lead you down a one-way street to
    Burnoutville — trust me. So, keep yourself fresh and raring to continue with your
    studying by quitting once you’ve completed all your studying for the day. This
    is a great way to ensure you maintain the routine by not letting yourself get

    whether you set (and more importantly maintain and continue) a routine or not

    believing that you have to do the same amount of studying every day. Whether you
    have the time to study for 10 hours or 10 minutes on a given day, all that matters
    is keeping yourself in the mindset that every day you will dedicate some time

  zh: '**你的例行程序不适合你？不要害怕做出改变。** 我在自学整个在线大学学位过程中学到的最重要的事情之一是，某一时刻对你有效的东西可能并不总是有效——这没关系。我们的义务会改变，无论是工作、家庭还是其他原因。因此，如果你发现维持例行程序变得困难，并且连续错过几天，别害怕改变一下，尝试一个适合你当时生活的不同例行程序。记住，一个每天都容易做到的例行程序是一个你能在必要时维持多年的例行程序。'
- en: '**Don’t be afraid to use rewards to keep yourself on track.** Somehow it became
    a negative thing to use rewards to keep yourself going on a routine. In my experience,
    humans are reward-driven creatures, which is why it’s an important tool to use
    in the self-teaching process. For example, after I complete a calculus assignment,
    I take myself for a treat, whether that’s a bubble tea, a long walk with my dog,
    or just enjoying some guilt-free time on social media. Don’t think that rewards
    are toxic — instead, celebrate completing your studying for the week or hitting
    a big topic milestone.'

  zh: '**不要害怕使用奖励来保持自己的进度。** 不知何故，使用奖励来保持日常规律被视为负面行为。在我的经验中，人类是以奖励为驱动的生物，这也是在自我学习过程中使用奖励的重要原因。例如，在完成一个微积分作业后，我会奖励自己，无论是喝一杯奶茶、带着我的狗散步，还是享受一些无负担的社交媒体时间。不要认为奖励是有害的——而是庆祝你完成了一周的学习或达到了一个重要的里程碑。'
