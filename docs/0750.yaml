    will find themselves on an escalator. In other words, they’re accelerating slowly
    but surely toward their destination with a constant upward motion (while the escalator
    sometimes breaks down, you’re still guaranteed to go up instead of down).

    to guide their progress, and don’t tweak their learning methods, are bound to
    be stuck on a staircase, where upward or downward motion is a possibility. While
    there’s nothing wrong with being on the staircase, you can easily give up and
    just start going down, whereas, on the escalator, you can only go up.

    data science and go on to have a career in the field, from those who thought they
    might just “wing it” and end up flaming out early on because they didn’t have
    an ingrained routine that forces them to sit down at their desk every day and
    study.

    steps for the last 6 years while going through post-secondary education and to
    help me study data science and have found that these four things are all it takes
    to create a routine that will bring you success. These four steps are simple and
    unglamorous but are enough to create a routine that you can easily stick with.

    but also about maintaining a healthy work-life balance (more about that later).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science and all of the topics within require a decent amount of mental
    rigor to self-teach. This is why the time of day when you choose to study should
    consistently be when you have the most energy and ability to focus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I choose to do all of my mentally rigorous studying (such as anything
    calculus-based) during the morning which is when I’m most energetic and focused.
    The afternoon is reserved for less mentally-taxing studying or other tasks that
    don’t require much brain power (which for me is usually studying data visualizations,
    statistics, or working on my personal projects). By studying during the most productive
    part of my day, I’ve ensured that I’ll be as effective and efficient as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The time of day when you’re most productive is different for everyone. Some
    people work best during the day, while others work best at night. The point is
    to pick the same time every day when you’ll schedule your studying. Not only that,
    but your brain needs to begin to associate a specific time of day with studying.
    This will help you maintain your focus for longer and will have you prepared to
    hit the books the minute your study session starts (as opposed to scrolling through
    your phone for 10 minutes because you need to amp yourself up to study).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I mentioned previously, this technique of picking a specific time of day
    to study data science is also important for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
    For example, today (a Friday), I finished all of my calculus studying this morning
    which meant that I was done for the day, having finished everything on my study
    to-do list for the week, and leaving me an entire half day to relax, catch up
    on errands, spend time with my dog, and enjoy a bit of a long weekend.

    are showing that where you work can have physical and psychological impacts on
    your health. This relates specifically to people who work in their [beds](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210217-is-it-bad-to-you-work-from-your-bed-for-a-year),
    which can result in ergonomic nightmares as well as the development of the wrong
    associations with your bedroom — i.e., that your bed isn’t necessarily just for
    sleep — which can wreak havoc on your sleep schedule and productivity.'

- en: The bottom line is that your brain is really good at associating specific locations
    with specific activities. This is why many college students will choose to go
    to campus to study even if they could just study from home. Thus, when it comes
    to self-studying a topic, it’s important to give your brain a leg up by letting
    it know that it’s time to focus when you sit down in a particular spot every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same philosophy should be used when picking your place to study. Having
    a pre-determined place to study tells your brain that every time you sit down
    there, it’s time to do work. This should be a place with excellent lighting, plenty
    of space for all of your study materials, and as good an ergonomic setup as you
    can make.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I’ve been studying at the same desk for over four years now. Whenever
    I sit down at the desk, I know that it’s time to work, whether I’m studying, writing,
    or doing some other type of work. This desk is huge and has everything I need
    within reach which minimizes the number of times I need to leave my desk during
    a study session which helps me in maintaining my focus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my favorite tricks to create a great study space is to have all of my
    data science books nearby. For whatever reason, having those books near me brings
    me so much inspiration because I know that soon I’ll be able to accomplish everything
    held in those chapters, whether it’s creating visuals that tell a story, doing
    multivariable calculus, or knowing how Python code can be written for a production
    environment.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seeing as you’re reading this article about developing a study routine, I would
    assume that you’ve already done the hard work and have created the curriculum
    that you’ll use to self-teach data science. Perfect! This means that you’ve pretty
    much already completed this third step.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing what you’re going to study before you sit down is a crucial part of
    maintaining a routine. Spending 10–20 minutes looking through your materials and
    trying to find video lectures is a waste of good study time, and a hassle that
    can actually make you resent the time you spend studying. Instead, take 30 minutes
    to an hour every Sunday night to plan out exactly what you’re going to be studying
    each day of the coming week. This should include laying out all of the topics
    you’ll cover in a day (be realistic and don’t overwhelm yourself) as well as queuing
    up video lectures, resources, and the code files you’ll be working on. This is
    also the time to charge your electronics, organize your study space, and maybe
    prepare some grab-and-go study snacks to keep you going.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I abide by this 30-minute rule every Sunday and write down a big
    to-do list for the upcoming week. This way, come Monday at 6 am, I’m not fumbling
    around trying to figure out what I’m working on and can instead get right into
    my work as the coffee kicks in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One big tip I’ll leave you with is that as soon as you’ve completed your studying
    to-dos for the day, stop. Stop your work right there and walk away — you’re done
    for the day. Yes, you can always say just one more calculus problem or just one
    more Leetcode challenge. However, this will lead you down a one-way street to
    Burnoutville — trust me. So, keep yourself fresh and raring to continue with your
    studying by quitting once you’ve completed all your studying for the day. This
    is a great way to ensure you maintain the routine by not letting yourself get
    overworked.

    calendar that just makes it so much easier to follow. Even if I know exactly what
    to expect each day, the satisfaction of checking things off my list is enough
    to keep me going on the routine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that you’ve determined what time of day you’ll study, where you’ll study,
    and what you’ll study, you need to put it all in your calendar. The calendar event
    should hold all of this information and should include a checklist of your study
    to-dos that can be checked off every time you complete a task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once something is on your calendar, it becomes important to complete and subconsciously
    you’ll begin to prioritize your daily tasks around your study time because your
    study time is “king”. Even if you’re doing the exact same thing every day, the
    reward center of your brain needs to get the endorphin rush of checking things
    off your to-do list. So, don’t forget to put all of your studying into your calendar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only is this an important tip for maintaining a habit, but keeping a calendar
    of your studying is a bit like keeping a diary or a log book. It’s a great way
    to track your time, see how long it’s taking you to study topics, and is a great
    reminder at the end of the year of how much work you’ve put in.

- en: '**When you can’t fulfill your study obligations for the day due to extraneous
    factors, find just 10 minutes to go over some concepts.** The main factor in deciding
    whether you set (and more importantly maintain and continue) a routine or not
    is whether or not you sit down every day and study. However, don’t be misled into
    believing that you have to do the same amount of studying every day. Whether you
    have the time to study for 10 hours or 10 minutes on a given day, all that matters
    is keeping yourself in the mindset that every day you will dedicate some time
    (no matter how much) to studying data science. Some days will be better than others,
    but all that matters is that you fulfill your routine in one way or another to
    keep your mind trained in anticipating that you have a routine to complete as
    part of every day.'

    of the most important things I learned while self-studying my entire online university
    degree is that what works for you at a given moment might not always work for
    you — and that’s okay. Our obligations change, whether they be for work, family,
    or something else. So, if you find that it’s becoming difficult to maintain your
    routine and that you’re missing several days in a row at a time, don’t be afraid
    to change things up and try a different routine that fits into your life at that
    time. Remember, a routine that’s easy to do every day is one that you’ll be able
    to maintain for years if necessary.'

    a negative thing to use rewards to keep yourself going on a routine. In my experience,
    humans are reward-driven creatures, which is why it’s an important tool to use
    in the self-teaching process. For example, after I complete a calculus assignment,
    I take myself for a treat, whether that’s a bubble tea, a long walk with my dog,
    or just enjoying some guilt-free time on social media. Don’t think that rewards
    are toxic — instead, celebrate completing your studying for the week or hitting
    a big topic milestone.'
