- en: Independent component analysis (ICA) is usually associated with dimensionality
    reduction tasks. However, the technique's most prominent application is separating
    linear contributions from the data, finding statistically independent components.
    For example, ICA is widely used as a tool to separate instrument tracks from audio.
    The objective of this article is to introduce and motivate ICA with the famous
    *“Cocktail Party”*example, then, a brief introduction to how ICA extracts independent
    components, using the basics of probability and information theory. Then, we explore
    a practical example of eye blink motion identification and removal from electroencephalogram
    (EEG) data.

- en: To better understand the separation of linear contributions from the data, the
    standard example is the *"Cocktail Party".* This scenario sets the stage at a
    bustling cocktail where two individuals engage in conversation, represented by
    the red (***Y1***) and blue (***Y2***) speakers in the room. Thus, two microphones
    are strategically placed nearby to capture the voices of both individuals, signified
    by the green (***X1***) and yellow (***X2***) microphones. The audibility of these
    voices varies based on the proximity of the conversationalists to each microphone.

    mixed audio file to acquire isolated audio recordings of each speaker. This enigma
    can be resolved through the adept application of Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA). Where, with the right assumptions about the data (that we're going to see
    in the next section), each independent component will be the sound of the blue
    and red spearer.

    which occur by voluntary or involuntary patient movement during image acquisition.
    A common one is the eye blink movement. Thus, tools such as ICA are widely used
    techniques to remove these kinds of noise [2]. As already discussed, ICA is a
    way to separate independent contributions of the signal. Hence, intuitively we
    should expect an important contribution of eye blink movement in channels closer
    to the eyes.

    tool, that assumes non-gaussian data and linear relationships between source and
    signals to seek statistically independent components. ICA allows us to separate
    different contributions to the data, making it particularly useful in scenarios
    where noise or unwanted signals need to be isolated. In the case of EEG data,
    ICA can identify and remove motion artifacts like eye blink movements, which can
    contaminate the neural signal.

- en: It's important to remark that ICA is a powerful tool that should be used with
    caution. Data-driven methods, do not assume any prior knowledge about the system.
    Therefore, confusion and spurious conclusions are common, making it essential
    to check for the requirements and evaluate the results with attention.
