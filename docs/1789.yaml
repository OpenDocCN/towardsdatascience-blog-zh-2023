    1950s. From rule-based expert systems to deep learning, AI has evolved into a
    powerful technology that has transformed various industries, from healthcare to
    finance, from transportation to manufacturing. The latest hype in AI is Generative
    AI. Yes, it’s a hype, but it undoubtedly has the potential to revolutionize many
    aspects of our personal and professional lives. In this blog post, we’ll explore
    one aspect which many people in the technology industry are thinking about: the
    way we build software.'

- en: One subgroup of Generative AI algorithms, a class of models called Large Language
    Models (LLMs) that can create text based on the user’s input data, has gained
    significant interest over the last couple of months. LLMs are, in their most basic
    description, multi-layer deep neural networks that are trained on large — very
    large — datasets from which the model learns the underlying patterns and generates
    new data that follow those patterns. Writing to an LLM and asking for a response
    is called “prompting” and knowing how to write effective prompts is a skill in
    demand, often referred to as prompt engineering.

- en: To tune LLMs to give a humanlike response, a machine learning training framework
    called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to be
    particularly powerful. This requires a large number of people to repeatedly prompt
    early versions of an LLM, read its response, and tell the model whether it passed
    their “humanlike” litmus test. The group of “prompters” are often told to pay
    attention, for example, to unintentional insults of the user by the model coming
    from gender or racial biases.

    write poetry, essays, marketing copies and more. The use cases are extensive,
    but in this blog post, we’ll explore the impact of Generative AI on the future
    of software development. Prompts are a key concept for Generative AI, so let us
    define it before we go into more detail.

- en: '**Prompts:** Prompts serve as the inputs or queries provided by a user or program
    to an LLM, aiming to elicit a targeted response from the model. These prompts
    encompass various forms such as natural language sentences, questions, code snippets,
    or commands. They can be a combination of text and code, allowing for versatile
    interactions. Furthermore, prompts can be nested or chained, enabling the utilization
    of the output from one prompt as the input for another. This capability fosters
    intricate and dynamic exchanges between the user and the LLM, or even among multiple
    LLMs.'

  zh: 尽管 LLM 最初是为语言生成任务开发的，但它们已经证明是多功能的，可以应用于生成文本之外的各种任务。我们将从探索一个对任何构建软件的人都特别有趣的能力开始：代码补全。
- en: LLMs can assist developers by predicting the next lines of code based on the
    code already written or based on a prompt that describes the functionality of
    a certain piece of the software. For example, a prompt like “write a Python function
    that transforms a NumPy array into a dictionary where the keys are the strings
    of the range over the first dimension of the array” would return the code below.

  zh: LLM 可以通过根据已编写的代码或根据描述软件某一部分功能的提示预测下一行代码来协助开发人员。例如，像“编写一个 Python 函数，将 NumPy 数组转换为字典，其中键是数组第一维范围的字符串”这样的提示将返回如下代码。

    one developer keeps the overall software structure in mind whereas the other writes
    the code. Products built on top of specialized LLMs, like GitHub’s Copilot can
    be an adequate alternative to a programming partner — helping to accelerate the
    software development process. Nonetheless, with this level of assistance, the
    user must understand how to prompt the LLM to achieve their desired output. This
    may sound simple at first, but in fact, it requires knowledge of data structures,
    functions and many other concepts in the relevant programming languages.

  zh: 大多数软件开发人员习惯于“结对编程”的概念，其中一个开发人员记住整体软件结构，而另一个开发人员编写代码。像 GitHub 的 Copilot 这样的专用
    LLM 上构建的产品可以作为编程伙伴的一个合适替代品——帮助加速软件开发过程。然而，在这种程度的协助下，用户必须了解如何提示 LLM 以实现他们想要的输出。这听起来可能很简单，但实际上需要对相关编程语言中的数据结构、函数和许多其他概念有一定的了解。
- en: The next leap in the [software revolution](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-software-revolution)
    will occur when developers do not need to break apart the overarching functionality
    of the software into smaller pieces that can be distilled in prompts that are
    understood by LLMs, like the array-to-dictionary example above. Generative AI
    will fundamentally change how software is developed when LLMs are capable of comprehending
    the main functionality themselves and providing suggestions for a feasible implementation
    of it, through a *conversational experience*.

    building such an application, it would still not be enough to launch it and be
    usable by anyone with an Android phone, because the code would most likely need
    to be hosted in Google Firebase and submitted for validation to Play Store (although
    the last step can be achieved through Firebase).

  zh: 尽管返回整个代码库对构建此类应用程序的人将大有帮助，但这仍不足以启动并使其在任何拥有 Android 手机的人都可用，因为代码很可能需要托管在 Google
    Firebase 中并提交至 Play Store 进行验证（尽管最后一步可以通过 Firebase 实现）。
- en: 'Nonetheless, the current capabilities of LLMs are not far away from achieving
    these functionalities. It’s a popular misconception that LLMs are the bottleneck
    in this chain of executions, for example, from writing the code for a mobile application
    to having it operational and downloadable on the Play Store. In fact, the current
    bottleneck is the *safe and reliable integration* of LLMs into third-party systems.
    For the mobile application example above, one would need at least two integrations:
    LLM to GitHub to store the code, and LLM to Firebase to configure the application
    and submit it for publication on Play Store.'

  zh: 尽管如此，当前 LLM 的能力离实现这些功能并不远。一个普遍的误解是 LLM 是这一执行链中的瓶颈，例如，从编写移动应用程序代码到在 Play Store
    上运营和可下载。实际上，当前的瓶颈是 LLM 的*安全和可靠集成*到第三方系统中。以上述移动应用程序示例为例，需要至少两个集成：LLM 到 GitHub 以存储代码，LLM
    到 Firebase 以配置应用程序并提交至 Play Store 发布。
- en: If LLMs were capable of distilling high-level software product descriptions
    and operationalizing the product, the development process would become a conversational
    experience akin to the interactions between a product manager and a full-stack
    software engineer. Speaking in an overly simplified manner, the creative head
    of the development efforts, the product manager, would provide the core functionality
    of the product in natural language, whereas her counterpart, the “full-stack software
    engineer-turned LLM” would ask clarification questions and technically execute
    the product manager’s descriptions.

    LLM”则会提出澄清问题并技术性地执行产品经理的描述。

- en: '**Version Control:** LLMs can be updated or replaced over time, so it’s important

    as well as contingency plans for unexpected issues or failures with new model

- en: In summary, Large Language Models (LLMs) have outstanding capabilities that
    are suitable for assisting with tasks which come from a large pool of well-structured
    information and require great attention to detail. By automating many repetitive
    and time-consuming tasks, LLMs are enabling their users, for example product managers,
    to focus on higher-level tasks that require creativity and problem-solving skills.
    While LLMs can automate many routine tasks, they do not have the same level of
    creativity, intuition, and empathy that humans possess.
  id: totrans-35

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the success of LLMs in many business applications, safe and reliable integrations
    to industry-specific third-party systems are important. Users of LLMs need to
    be able to execute certain actions that they would normally not be able to perform
    without support from a dedicated software developer. No-code tools are already
    on the rise across many industries and job functions, but their capabilities need
    to mature to build complex software beyond a specific and narrow functionality
    (for example the functionalities that can be built with Levity).

    what we see today may just be the beginning. From automating routine tasks to
    enabling new forms of creativity and innovation, LLMs are poised to play a major
    role in the future of software development. As the Generative AI boom continues
    to rumble on, we must look beyond the hype to see a seminal moment in technology
    development forming. Generative AI has changed how we interact with software,

    vision to build it through the medium of conversation.
