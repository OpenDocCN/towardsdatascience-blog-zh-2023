- en: ‘War’ is very simple. 2 players are each dealt out half of a standard 52-card
    deck. The two then face off, flipping over their top card. Whoever has the highest
    card takes both cards. On the occasion that the cards have the same value, players
    risk the next 3 cards of their deck, and battle with the 4th card. Whoever plays
    the highest 4th card wins all of the cards in the pile (their own 3 cards plus
    the opponent’s 3 cards). The game ends when a player does not have any cards left.

    your opponent’s card. **You are at the mercy of dumb luck.**

    cards could predict a winner before the game even started. What I was not expecting
    to find was that this game, under the right circumstances, can actually go on
    *forever*.
