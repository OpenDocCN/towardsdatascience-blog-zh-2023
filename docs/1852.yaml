- en: Deploying a machine learning model once is a straightforward task; repeatedly
    bringing machine learning models into production is much harder. To address this
    complex process, the concept of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) emerged. MLOps
    represents the convergence of DevOps, machine learning, and software engineering
    practices. There are several nuances needed here, but a better definition of what
    exactly MLOps entails is an open discussion and a battleground for vendors to
    pitch their products. For brevity’s sake, I’d rather move on to our MLOps story.

    six months earlier, and we started with a handful of inherited projects. Our team’s
    goal was simple on paper: we were to provide a data / ML platform for *Online
    Services,* a part of DPG Media that focuses on websites and communities. Our “portfolio”
    consisted of a dozen brands that included amongst others: a popular tech news
    website and its’ community, two job portals, a community for expecting parents,
    several websites where one could buy second-hand cars, and a couple more with
    similar audiences. This is relevant for the rest of the post.'
