- en: So you have created an ML model which seems to have reliable results. Congratulations!
    I know from experience that oftentimes it’s not easy to get reliable ML models,
    especially with limited ML exposure as a Data Analyst. However, once the model
    is complete, the next challenge is to productionize it so that it can be integrated
    into the product.

- en: For many Data Analysts, ML model deployment can be uncharted territory, as **most
    data modeling concepts are only used for analytics purposes and not deployed in
    production**. While some companies have ML Ops teams to help with these deployments,
    it is essential for Analysts to understand the key concepts and caveats involved
    to collaborate effectively with their ML Ops counterparts.

    concepts and caveats that Data Analysts need to know when deploying their models
    to production. I will also explain how deploying ML models differs from regular
    analytics projects. With this understanding, Data Analysts can ensure that their
    models are deployed successfully and deliver meaningful results.
