- en: We see there is growing attention to Human-centred AI (HAI) in various communities.
    The basic idea of HAI is to put humans and humanity at the centre of designing
    AI-powered applications. The HAI design seeks symbiosis of humans and AI — AI
    assisting human tasks rather than replacing them and humans improving AI by providing
    feedback.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, and other enterprises
    value the idea of HAI and have developed their own HAI design methods and shared
    them in public as guidebooks. For instance, the [People+AI guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/)
    from Google’s PAIR research team shows how to organise and facilitate a series
    of workshops where participants with different domain expertise co-design the
    functionality and user interface of an AI application. It also provides a set
    of questions and guides important to be addressed during the HAI design process,
    such as “What is the user value of the application?” and “How the prediction results
    should be explained to users?”. The guidebook further gives us various example
    use cases where HAI designs were applied in practice to inspire the design participants.
    Microsoft shares an HAI method called “[HAX toolkits](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/)”.
    It offers design guides and workbooks in PowerPoint and Excel formats to serve
    a similar purpose as the PAIR’s guidebook.

    to participate in the design process and facilitate capturing and transforming
    the people’s needs into the application design by integrating the theories and
    practice of User Experience, Design Thinking and Responsible AI into a unified
    design framework.

- en: Ok, now I am talking about manufacturing :). You may think manufacturing is
    a domain that can be easily automatised, but not at all! Even at many modern factories,
    many skilled persons are working there and play important roles in developing,
    running, and improving factory operations. It is, therefore, vital to creating
    harmony between humans and machines.

- en: So why not use HAI methods when integrating AI technology in manufacturing?
    That’s what we — a research team with expertise in AI, manufacturing, and UX —
    thought. We work with a large multinational manufacturer trying to develop and
    implement a Machine Learning model for anomaly detection in the manufacturing
    processes. The model detects anomalous patterns of data from sensory devices installed
    in critical pieces of manufacturing equipment. A prototype of the model was there.
    We used the People+AI guidebook to help the company’s AI project. This method
    was chosen because it seemed to be the most comprehensive and well-structured
    one. We used this HAI method through a one-day workshop with about ten company
    members with various roles, such as R&D engineers, process engineers, data scientists,
    technicians, and Lean Six Sigma experts.

  zh: 那么，在制造业中整合AI技术时，为什么不使用HAI方法呢？这正是我们——一个拥有AI、制造和用户体验专业知识的研究团队——的想法。我们与一家大型跨国制造商合作，试图开发并实施一种用于制造过程中的异常检测的机器学习模型。该模型检测来自关键制造设备中安装的传感器设备的数据中的异常模式。该模型的原型已经存在。我们使用了《People+AI》指南来帮助公司的AI项目。选择这种方法是因为它似乎是最全面且结构良好的方法。我们通过为期一天的研讨会使用了这种HAI方法，参与者包括约十名公司成员，涵盖了研发工程师、工艺工程师、数据科学家、技术人员和精益六西格玛专家等不同角色。
- en: So, what is the result of using the method? Well, I would not say it was a complete
    failure but not particularly successful. Overall, the method did not effectively
    address the complex and multifaceted challenges when designing an AI-powered application
    for an industrial process. The workshop facilitators (we) and the participants
    felt that they had to deal with too many questions from different angles at the
    same time, causing them cognitive overload and giving them a disorganised and
    confusing experience.

  zh: 那么，使用这种方法的结果如何呢？嗯，我不会说它完全失败，但也不特别成功。总体而言，这种方法未能有效应对设计AI驱动的工业过程应用时复杂多面的挑战。研讨会的组织者（我们）和参与者感到他们必须同时处理来自不同角度的太多问题，导致了认知过载，并且体验混乱无序。
- en: But we learned a lot from it! We became aware that the method was simply not
    well fit for the manufacturing context and that a significant reconstruction of
    the method was necessary to cope with the challenges we experienced. Considering
    the similarity among the HAI methods, we believe the result would not be much
    different if we had used other HAI methods.
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 但我们从中学到了很多！我们意识到这种方法根本不适合制造业背景，需要对方法进行重大重构，以应对我们遇到的挑战。考虑到HAI方法之间的相似性，我们认为如果使用其他HAI方法，结果不会有太大不同。
- en: Let us share our reflection on why the method gracefully failed with cognitive
    overload and confusion when used in manufacturing. Several factors contributed
    to the failure, but in this article, I pick up three significant ones. I hope
    this article is enjoyable for those interested in using AI in industrial settings,
    whatever your expertise is.

  zh: 让我们分享一下我们对这种方法在制造业中优雅地失败的反思。几个因素导致了这种失败，但在本文中，我挑选了三个重要的因素。希望这篇文章对那些有兴趣在工业环境中使用AI的人无论你的专业是什么，都能带来一些启发。
- en: '**1\. Workflow design was not an integral part of the method:**'

  zh: '**1\. 工作流设计不是该方法的一个组成部分：**'
- en: The current HAI methods from the tech companies and other enterprises seem to
    be primarily geared toward assisting the design of applications used by a single
    user, such as mobile phone apps for consumers. In such use cases, the interaction
    between the human and machine typically occurs through the screen, fingers, eyes,
    and ears of the user. The guidebook seems to support well in designing such interaction
    by enabling designers to explore different user scenarios and experiences, find
    the right balance between automation and user control, manage expectations around
    AI capabilities, and so forth.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 目前，科技公司和其他企业的HAI方法似乎主要针对帮助设计单一用户使用的应用程序，例如面向消费者的手机应用。在这种使用情况下，人机交互通常通过用户的屏幕、手指、眼睛和耳朵进行。指南似乎在设计这种交互时表现良好，使设计师能够探索不同的用户场景和体验，找到自动化和用户控制之间的平衡，管理对AI能力的期望等等。
- en: On the other hand, the context of AI service in an industrial facility can be
    quite complex. Let us imagine the case of using anomaly detection in a manufacturing
    plant. This application shows the health status of the sensory devices through
    a monitor screen placed on the shop floor and sends an alarm when an anomaly is
    detected. First-hand users of the application are operators. Of course, interactions
    between operators and the application are important, but things do not end there.
    What should operators do or want to do when they receive the alarm? Does this
    person want to analyse the situation deeper by oneself with the help of the application?
    Or should he or she consult one’s supervisor or technician for further analysis
    and decision-making? Should the equipment supplier be immediately contacted instead?
    Does the appropriate action depend on the seriousness of the anomaly? Does the
    action depend on the skill and knowledge of these persons? How many stakeholders
    need to be involved in the decision-making? What information should be available
    for them? How can information be shared among those actors?

  zh: 另一方面，工业设施中的AI服务背景可能非常复杂。我们可以设想在制造厂使用异常检测的案例。这个应用程序通过放置在车间地板上的监视器屏幕显示传感器设备的健康状态，并在检测到异常时发出警报。应用程序的第一手用户是操作员。当然，操作员与应用程序之间的交互很重要，但事情并不止于此。当操作员收到警报时应该做什么或想做什么？这个人是否希望通过应用程序的帮助深入分析情况？或者他或她是否应该咨询上级或技术人员进行进一步的分析和决策？是否应该立即联系设备供应商？适当的行动是否取决于异常的严重性？行动是否取决于这些人的技能和知识？需要多少利益相关者参与决策？他们需要什么信息？如何在这些参与者之间共享信息？
- en: As you see, in a manufacturing context, an initial event — raising the alarm
    in this case — often triggers a complex chain of other actions potentially involving
    multiple persons within or outside of the organisation. Let’s call this chain
    of actions a workflow. We have learned that finger-eye-screen interactions are
    hardly designed without the design of the workflows. Thus, it is crucial to consider
    these designs simultaneously or at least plan the workflow design earlier in the
    development process, as they are closely interconnected.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如你所见，在制造环境中，初始事件——在此例中是发出警报——通常会触发一系列复杂的动作链，这些动作可能涉及组织内部或外部的多个人员。我们称这系列动作为工作流。我们已经了解到，手指-眼睛-屏幕的交互很难在没有工作流设计的情况下进行设计。因此，同时考虑这些设计或至少在开发过程中较早规划工作流设计是至关重要的，因为它们紧密相连。
- en: Did the HAI method support this? No, not for the workflow design part. During
    the workshop at the case company, the design participants were glad to create
    different paper prototypes of how anomaly status and other relevant information
    should be displayed on the shop floor. They, however, quickly became unsure of
    which prototypes would be suitable for the actual use, as they had a limited understanding
    of how the workflows would unfold. An alarm on the shop floor is just one trigger
    of a workflow. There could be more scenarios triggering other workflows, such
    as false negatives, false positives, sensor degradation, sensor upgrades, etc.
    Without proper methodological support, imagining all those scenarios and their
    corresponding workflows required significant cognitive effort from the participants.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: HAI 方法是否支持这一点？不，工作流设计部分没有。在案例公司的研讨会上，设计参与者很高兴创建了关于异常状态和其他相关信息在车间地板上应如何显示的不同纸质原型。然而，由于他们对工作流如何展开了解有限，他们很快对哪些原型适合实际使用感到不确定。车间地板上的警报只是工作流的一个触发器。可能还有更多场景触发其他工作流，如假阴性、假阳性、传感器退化、传感器升级等。在没有适当的方法论支持的情况下，想象所有这些场景及其相应的工作流需要参与者付出大量的认知努力。

  zh: '**2\. 设计指南和问题引发了大量额外的询问：**'
- en: As we discussed in the introduction of this article, the PAIR guidebook, like
    other HAI methods, offers a set of questions and guides that need to be considered
    during the application design process. I can show some more examples here; “How
    to establish a proper level of trust so that users will not put too much or too
    little trust in the AI result?”, “How can the application accept feedback from
    the users to improve the application’s behaviour?”.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These questions or guides are surely beneficial for us to thoroughly tackle
    key design concerns in the design process. At the same time, addressing these
    questions requires extensive what-if thinking, especially for AI-driven applications
    behaving probabilistically. The exact behaviours of the applications are not always
    clear during development. For simpler interactions, such as of mobile phone apps,
    the what-if thinking may still be manageable. In the workshop at the company,
    however, what-if thinking quickly snowballed to a level we could not handle.
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the start of the workshop, little was decided except the participants’ will
    to utilise the anomaly detection model in the operations. We followed the design
    process that the guidebook suggested, and the design guides and questions seemed
    to be helpful for the process. The workshop participants, however, became quickly
    unsure which questions and guides were more important than others and in which
    depth or detail the questions should be answered. Those questions were also tightly
    interrelated.
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consequently, answering those questions became a lot of guesswork. Let’s take
    one of the design questions as an example — how to establish the users’ trust
    in the application. Many factors can affect this, but at least it depends on how
    prediction results are presented to users. The design of the presentation can
    be affected by the model’s performance. The performance is going to be affected
    by the production-phase data that is not fully known during the development. As
    we discussed earlier, the result presentation is also dependent on the workflows.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you see, a single design question causes a chain of other interlinked questions
    that are hardly answered at once. An answer depends on another answer which also
    depends on another answer which can be only partially answered…no wonder why the
    participants quickly got puzzled and overwhelmed. A participant said in the end,
    “ok, we know now there is a huge mountain ahead of us, but we are still unsure
    how to climb it.”

- en: The HAI methods facilitate design participants to generate a large amount of
    information necessary to design an AI-powered application. The methods offer various
    tools, such as ideation cards, design questions, guides, and workbooks, to assist
    in the generation and documentation of this information.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But who will consolidate all those information? Through the workshop, it became
    apparent that the method was designed primarily from a UX designer’s perspective
    and that the designer seemed to be the one consolidating the information and transforming
    it into the design.
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ok, we understand that the phrase “Human-Centred AI” is emphasised in the HAI
    methods, but they are much biased toward UX. This bias may not confuse people
    when the methods are used for a simpler interaction, such as a mobile phone app.
    UX designers have rich experience in designing the functionality and interface
    of such an application.
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But how about when the method is used for industrial processes where the workflow
    design is a critical and inseparable part of the interaction design? In such a
    multifaceted use case, should a UX designer still consolidate the information
    from the workshop? Or would a project leader with a broad and in-depth understanding
    of the industrial processes be better suited for the task? We started the workshop
    without a clear understanding of this issue, which further complicated the workshop
    (that was already a mess!).

    create a state of cognitive overload and confusion. We simply entered the workshop
    with a premature understanding of the limitation of the HAI methods when applied
    in industrial processes. Although those methods provide us with a solid foundation,
    we found that a significant modification would be necessary to suit the manufacturing
    domain.

    what-if questions that arise during the design process. Hopefully, we can report
    the result in future!! :).
