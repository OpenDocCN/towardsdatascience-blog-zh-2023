- en: The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented
    programming. It states that software entities, such as classes, modules, and functions,
    should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you
    should be able to add new features to your software without having to modify existing
    code.

- en: The goal of the OCP is to create software that is more flexible and easier to
    maintain over time. By designing software that can be extended without modifying
    existing code, you can reduce the risk of introducing new bugs and make your code
    easier to read and understand.

- en: While the OCP is primarily concerned with software design, it can also be applied
    to data science. Data scientists often work with large, complex data sets and
    models that need to be updated and modified over time. By following the OCP, data
    scientists can ensure that their models are easily extensible and maintainable
    over time.
