    its applications, and how it differs from more traditional deep learning methods.

    bayesian statistics, but you don't know exactly how it is used, you are in the
    right place.

    they are very powerful tools, **they don’t provide a measure of their uncertainty.**

    probabilities that are often not calibrated.

    especially in the areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars. We want a model
    to be able to be able to estimate when its very unsure about classifying a subject
    with a brain cancer, and in this case we require further diagnosis by a medical
    expert. Similarly we want autonomous cars to be able to slow down when it identifies
    a new environment.'
