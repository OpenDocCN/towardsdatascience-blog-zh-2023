    publishing in journals and conferences. It is based on my past experience as a
    PhD student. One of my AI (deep learning) papers [[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8694781)]
    recently crossed 1000 citations per Google Scholar [[2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtBCz0QAAAAJ)].
    According to Web of Science™ database [citation impact — [3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_impact)],
    only ~ 0.026% papers have over 1k citations. While it is great to see the post-publication
    impact the paper has had, the point up to the paper getting accepted was a lot
    of trial and error. This paper was rejected multiple times, took a couple of years,
    and underwent multiple iterations before it was accepted. I have tried to distill
    my learnings here into a guided process. Hopefully, the guidelines below will
    help you in your publishing journey.

    To draw an analogy, I think starting a startup company and the PhD publication
    process have a few things in common. Both have an uncertain future initially,
    but both could result in a novel contribution in their respective areas in the
    end. Just like a startup, your publication process needs a survey, vision, strategy,
    iterations, and scaling. My thoughts are organized below in the same sequence.

- en: Read up on current state-of-the-art in the area you are trying to publish. Remember
    you are trying to add to what is already out there. Many publications are open-access,
    so finding papers on the latest research should not be an issue. Plus, your university
    should also be able to provide you with necessary access. Google Scholar and ResearchGate
    are great open sources. Given that technology and scientific research are advancing
    so fast, I would also follow top researchers and companies in your area of research
    in LinkedIn, Twitter, and similar sites for the latest updates. If applicable,
    I would also explore statistics and data repositories for exploratory analysis.
    On the pace of the survey, recommended numbers vary from reading 1 to 7 papers
    per week in preparation for literature review and having 30 to 200 papers included/referenced
    in your survey.

    maximize learning, and land on building something novel the market actually needs,
    i.e., finding the elusive product-market fit. In your case, that would be landing
    on a publication, i.e., paper-publication fit. Both require strategy.

    You will need some type of life-hack to get through PhD. Unsurprisingly, two-thirds
    of startups fail as well, i.e., have negative return on investment [[6](https://hbr.org/2021/05/why-start-ups-fail)].

- en: Once you and your advisor are aligned on the strategy/focus, start your research
    and try to get to a point where you have something to show for (aka an MVP or
    minimal viable product in *startup* terms). Once you have an MVP paper, submit
    to journals/conferences starting at the higher difficulty range but have known
    shorter review cycles. Shorter review cycles let you iterate and incorporate feedback
    quicker and pivot strategy sooner, if needed.

    feedback to make bold changes to your paper and/or strategy. Ensure that you are
    evaluating, responding to, and incorporating the feedback/gaps provided by the
    reviewers. Rejection with feedback is a blessing and a vital part of the process.
    Think of it as training an AI model. The weights of the artificial neural networks
    are adjusted based on feedback from labeled/training data during the training
    process. As shown in figure 3 below, these adjustments are initially higher and
    gradually taper off when you get closer to paper-publication fit (or global minima
    in AI/ML).

    submission guidelines carefully. There is nothing worse than waiting for months
    for feedback, only to learn the paper you submitted can not be considered because
    it isn’t aligned with the journal/conference’s theme or you missed an important submission
    step. If applicable, it will help to research past papers from journal/conference
    you are submitting to and cite relevant work from those papers. Also, if your
    co-authors (e.g., advisor) have had successful papers in certain journals, try
    them as well.

    after a few iterations, as the rejection reasons get less critical. It could take
    a really long time to get there. Note that your first publication could most likely
    be the most difficult and take the longest time.

    where you can apply knowledge gained from solving one task to another related
    task, with decreasing amount of learning effort. Just like that, all the validated
    learning from your first publication will come in very handy in speeding up your
    2nd, 3rd and subsequent publications.

    to get to the necessary number of publications. Stick to what works for you, and
    continue to learn and tweak the process for more impactful publications. Good
    luck!
