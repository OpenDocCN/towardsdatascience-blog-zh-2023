- en: It was the summer of 1988 when I stepped onto a boat for the first time in my
    life. It was a passenger ferry from Dover, England to Calais, France. I didn’t
    know it then, but I was catching the tail end of the golden era of Channel crossings
    by ferry. This was right before budget airlines and the Channel Tunnel [almost
    kiboshed](https://journals.openedition.org/rhcf/2452) what I still think is the
    best way to make that journey.

    books. Instead, what I came upon was an impossibly large, gleaming white skyscraper
    with small square windows. And the skyscraper appeared to be resting on its side
    for some baffling reason. From my viewing angle on the dock, I couldn’t see the
    ship’s hull and funnels. All I saw was its long, flat, windowed, exterior. I was
    looking at a horizontal skyscraper.

    My brain had computed the **expected shape of a ferry**…
