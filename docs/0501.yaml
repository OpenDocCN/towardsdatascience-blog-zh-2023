- en: Data, analytics, and machine learning have become ubiquitous around sports over
    the past decade or so. And, in tandem, non-traditional strategies have grown in
    popularity around the sports world. In football, fourth-down attempts and two-point
    conversion attempts have risen, as analytics has proven the increased value of
    employing these strategies. In 2021, [fourth-down attempts reached a high of 793](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-fourth-down-conversion-chart-rate-by-distance/vofkeub6xwms6imajxqkfipp),
    up more than 70% from 2011\. In basketball, the long two-point attempt has [basically
    vanished](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-kevin-garnett-and-tracy-mcgrady-had-shot-threes-instead-of-long-twos/),
    as analytics gurus have demonstrated the greater expected value of the corner
    three-pointer and lay-ups.

    change in tactics and strategy, so too does my pastime of tennis. For most tennis
    professionals, the value of sports analytics is in [opposition scouting.](https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/the-role-of-analytics-in-tennis-is-on-a-long-slow-rise)
    Using opponent stats can tell a player what an optimal strategy might look like
    in terms of whether to attack an opponent's backhand, force them to play long
    rallies from the baseline, or try to bring them toward the net. However, there
    are still fruitful opportunities for pros to exploit the vast array of data that
    the sport produces, from legacy statistics like serving percentages to more advanced
    stats like player positioning from vision AI applications.

- en: One of these opportunities to analyze tennis data became clear to me last year
    after I joined a local tennis league after a four-year hiatus. During my first
    few matches, I realized that, while my first serves were sailing out of bound
    too often, my opponents were able to attack my weak second serve. After one too
    many break points, I thought to myself *am I better off ditching my second serve
    and using my first serve twice?*

- en: The premise is fairly simple. In tennis, the player serving the ball has an
    advantage because they are able to start the point — giving them strategic choices
    like where to place the ball and what type of spin to hit with. The serve is also
    one of the fastest shots in tennis, with the ATP circuit players frequently reaching
    speeds of approximately [120 MPH (193 KM/H)](https://tenniscreative.com/fastest-tennis-serve/).
    Not only that, but the server gets *two* chances at their serve in case they miss
    the first.

- en: Most players, amateur and professional, employ two different serves. See, serving
    strategy in tennis is predicated on a fairly simple principle. Players typically
    use their first serve to play a ball faster and into tighter, more advantageous
    windows, such as out wide or down the center of the “T,” where the service boxes
    meet. The point is to gain an advantage by forcing a weak return, pushing the
    opponent into an undesirable court position, or winning the point uncontested
    through an ace. The second serve, then, is typically played more safely. Players
    tend to use play a slower ball into windows with a higher margin for error. The
    player will still attempt to gain an advantage by controlling the opponent’s court
    position, but the advantage tends to be smaller than on a successful first serve.

    by Jeff Sackmann, founder of [TennisAbstract.com](http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player.cgi?p=JeffSackmann)
    (thanks to Jeff for giving his permission to use his data for this article). I
    pulled the data from [Jeff’s GitHub](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)
    and merged the datasets spanning from 2000 to 2020\. The analyses used in the

    tournament and surface. However, my primary focus is the serve data (i.e., total
    first serves in, aces, double faults, etc.). Additionally, since the ATP is the
    men’s tour, this data is subsetted for male players only. I intend to add WTA
    data to this analysis and the Dash app.

    who played between 2000–2020 would be better off adopting the two-first-serve
    strategy. I’m no Uncle Toni, but the fact that 20% of players on the circuit would
    benefit from adopting a more aggressive serving strategy seems like a fairly large

    variables such as first-serve percentage — was to roll the observations to the
    player level. At the match level, there is too much variance to extrapolate a
    comprehensive serving strategy. Figure 2 below is a histogram of the expected
    value of a two-first-serve strategy for Rafael Nadal on a match-by-match basis.
    Notice how, even for one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Nadal’s expected
    value varies fairly significantly.

    data. I found that in any given match, around 35% of players would have fared
    better by using two first serves. However, when looking at each player’s career
    data, only 24% of players are better off using two first serves. When I subset
    for players who played at least 50 matches over their career, that number drops
    further to 20%.

- en: For years, analysts have recognized height as a key factor in serving success.
    Even casual fans may remember John Isner, whose 11-hour and 5-minute showdown
    with Nicolas Mahut shattered match-length records. Isner, who measures 6 foot
    10, dominated his service games, not losing a single break point during the final
    set of the match. And, the numbers corroborate the common wisdom of tennis analysts
    and the lived experience of Isner himself. Looking at the relationship between
    height and the two-first-serve strategy, the players who would benefit the most
    appear to be the giants of the sport. Ivo Karlovic, another towering ATP pro (coincidentally
    also known for his long-lasting matches), reaches the top of the list, peaking
    in 2009 at an expected value of over 0.75 points using a two-first-serve strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the giants of the sport, the benefit of a two-first-serve strategy derives
    from their ability to win points when their first serves go in. Karlovic in 2009
    netted a first-serve win percentage of almost 85%, significantly above the sample
    average of approximately 71%. Similarly, Isner notched a first-serve win percentage
    of 82%. Such a high rate of success, paired with even a modest first-serve percentage
    — the rate at which a player is able to put the ball into play with their first
    serve — is often enough to vault the server to a higher expected scoring value
    under a two-first-serve strategy.

- en: So, what does this mean for pros on the ATP circuit? Well, for the majority,
    not much. 4-in-5 players are better off maintaining their traditional first-second-serve
    strategy. However, for the remaining 1-in-5 players, especially players whose
    height exceeds 6 feet 4 inches (193cm), I would encourage trying out a two-first-serve
    strategy (although, I might not wait for a tournament final to give it a go).
    Players who can demonstrate exceptional ability to win their points on a first-serve
    might benefit from pressuring their opponents with a two-first-serve strategy,
    even at the risk of double faulting more often.
