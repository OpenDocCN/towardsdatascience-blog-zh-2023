    some kind of word generators,” [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), one of
    OpenAI’s founding members, said. “It’s a lot more correct to think about [them]
    as **the kernel process of an emerging Operating System**.”

    and computer systems.

- en: Right now, you’re holding a device that has some computing power inside it,
    but you can’t directly access that power. Your interaction is mediated by an Operating
    System (such as Windows, Mac OS, and Android,), which transforms a collection
    of chips and circuits into a user-friendly interface.

    (like reading some bald dude’s article) through a variety of apps running on top
    of it. Each app has its own User Interface (UI) and its own set of tasks it can
    accomplish. You jump from one app to another, one UI to another, depending on
    what you need to do.
