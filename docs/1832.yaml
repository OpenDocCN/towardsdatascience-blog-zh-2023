    to watch while having breakfast, I stumbled upon a replay of the Senate Hearing
    on Oversight of AI. It had only been 40 minutes since it started, so I decided
    to watch the rest of it (Talk about an interesting way to spend a Sunday morning!).

    AI take place and you want to catch up on the key takeaways, you have four options:
    witness it live, look for future recordings (both options would require three
    hours of your life); read the written version (transcripts), which are about 79
    pages long and over 29,000 words; or read reviews on websites or social media
    to get different opinions and form your own ( if it’s not from others).'

    it’s tempting to go for the shortcut and rely on reviews instead of going to the
    original source (I’ve been there too). If you choose the shortcut for this hearing,
    it’s highly probable that most reviews you’ll find on the web or social media
    focus on OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s call for regulating AI. However, after watching
    the hearing, I felt there was more to explore beyond the headlines.

    Hearing transcript and use the NLTK Package (a Python package for natural language
    processing — NLP) to analyze it, compare most used words and apply some sentiment
    scores across different groups of interest (OpenAI, IBM, Academia, Congress) and
    see what could be between the lines. Spoiler alert! Out of the 29,000 words analyzed,
    only 70 (0.24%) were related to words like regulation, regulate, regulatory, or
    legislation.

    an open-source NLP library that can handle contractions, punctuation, and special
    characters. Next, we’ll remove common words that don’t add much meaning, like
    “a,” “an,” “the,” “is,” and “and,” using the [**stop word**](https://pythonspot.com/nltk-stop-words/)
    resource from the NLTK library. Finally, we’ll apply **Lemmatization** whichreduces
    words to their base form, known as the lemma. For example, “running” becomes “run”
    and “happier” becomes “happy.” This technique helps us work with the text more

    a people-centric approach when he talks about AI, repeating words like **“think,”

    out among others. An interesting fact is that the word **“system”** seems to be

    I am all for raising awareness about AI’s role in our present and future but also

    is where the extra effort in the **“thinking”** and **“knowing”** is needed.
