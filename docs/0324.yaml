    making with some features being more valuable or useful for our analysis than
    others.

- en: The difference between algorithms processing our data and minds processing the
    world around us lies in the ability to understand context and move easily between
    inductive (when I am hot, I sweat. So when the temperature is hot in the future,
    I will sweat in the future), deductive (If A = B, B = C therefore A = C), and
    abductive reasoning (I left my food on the counter in a room with my dog. I returned
    and my food is gone and my dog looks guilty. My dog must have eaten my food).
    Algorithms can be trained reliably to perform all of these types of reason but
    not reliably all at the same time in the way humans can.

- en: Inductive reasoning follows a specific pathway. It begins making a specific
    observation (the leaves on the observed tree is green), notices a pattern (this
    group of trees in front of me all have green leaves), and draws a general conclusion
    (all trees have green leaves. Classification algorithms such as logistic regression
    perform well at inductive reasoning. They have a target variable and use specific
    features to draw a larger conclusion.

- en: Here’s an example of this phenomenon. Say you are performing a logistic regression
    algorithm that is able to identify the difference between an apple and an orange.
    Your target variable is a binary variable- 1 for Apple or 0 for Orange. Your features
    are categorical variables for color and skin texture and a boolean for stem or
    no stem. When running your model, the algorithm concludes a fruit is an Apple
    if the color of the fruit is not orange, the skin is smooth, and there is a stem.
    The features are specific, the algorithm is able to detect a patten, and in the
    end, the resulting output is general.

- en: Where Inductive Reasoning begins with the specific and leads to the general,
    Deductive Reasoning starts with the general and draws specific conclusions. This
    would look like driving past a forest of trees, noticing all of the leaves on
    the trees are green, then making a hypothesis that any given tree in that forest
    would also have green leaves.

- en: Basic clustering algorithms do well with deductive reasoning. They take the
    features in model, identify data points closest together around a centroid, and
    group them based on proximity thereby using general information (all data points
    are on this plane) to make specific conclusions (those closest in Euclidean space
    are most similar in a way that’s valuable).

- en: Abductive Reasoning happens when an algorithm draws a conclusion with incomplete
    data after noticing a pattern. Say you want to conclude the temperature outside
    using only the clothes people are wearing. When people are cold, they typically
    wear coats. When looking outside, no one is wearing a coat so you conclude it
    must be warm.

    use a simulated environment to draw conclusions in the face of incomplete observations
    by calculating trajectories and optimizing for rewards.

- en: Let’s run through an example. Say you are building a Q-Learning algorithm as
    the basic model for a self-driving vehicle to deliver packages to people in a
    neighborhood. You want to make sure your self-driving car is able to deliver all
    of the packages by the end of the day safely and efficiently. To train your self-driving
    vehicle, you create a digital agent that you can reward every time the vehicle
    safely drops off a package.

    path and making decisions along the way. After each observation, the agent tries
    its hand at traveling the route until it makes the best decisions to get optimal
    reward. Decisions the agent can make are best speed to drive, what way to turn
    the wheel, when to brake, and when to accelerate. However, as the agent is driving
    its typical path, it comes across construction that causes a traffic jam. It may
    look something like this:'

    make even though it has approached a new situation it has not encountered before.
    After performing some more training, the agent can make the best prediction of
    the best action to take while still performing its main objective: getting all
    of the packages delivered on time safely. During its calculations, the agent may
    find that there is another package to be delivered- one that may have traditionally
    been delievered later on in its route. By making a detour and delivering the package
    at another home then traveling a new path back to the original home, the agent
    may be able to gain its maximum reward. Here is what this decision may look like:'

- en: This type of reasoning is an example of abductive reasoning. The agent was able
    to decide a best course of action even though it did not have complete information
    about the construction that caused traffic. It was able to realize that traffic
    would add to its delivery time and that it would be best to try another path without
    being told.

    task it is being applied to. Pushing the possibilities of AI by understanding
    all three major types of AI reasoning can bring us one step closer to more helpful
    and robust generalizable AI.

    to be seen, however, suggesting that it is, AI with the ability to reason with
    this level of complexity would be a game changer.
