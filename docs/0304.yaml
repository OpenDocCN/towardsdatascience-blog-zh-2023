    to train. Take ChatGPT, for instance. On a single GPU, its training would have
    taken 355 years.

    of such models. Yet, it comes with its own set of challenges.

- en: Quantum bits (qubits) are the basic unit we use inside a quantum computer. Unlike
    classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, quantum bits are in a complex linear
    relationship between their two basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩, called superposition.

- en: This makes them extremely powerful. First, this relationship is not discrete
    but continuous, meaning the qubit can assume any value between the two basis states.
    Second, the relationship builds upon complex numbers — these are two-dimensional
    constructs — which exceed the capabilities of the one-dimensional numbers we’re
    used to working with.
