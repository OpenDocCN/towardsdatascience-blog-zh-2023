    you should select a T-Test. There are several ways to test for normality. The
    easiest way to check is by creating a histogram and visually inspecting the data.
    If this roughly shapes a Normal Distribution, then continue on. If still unsure,
    it’s best to do a more statistical test, such as the Shapiro-Wilkes test for Normality.
    [Here is a great article about the various ways to test your data for normality](/normality-tests-in-python-31e04aa4f411).

- en: If you have confirmed that your data conforms to Normality, then the next step
    is to check whether the datasets have equal variances. This determines whether
    you should use the Welch’s t-test or the Student’s t-test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main differences between Welch’s t-test and Student’s t-test are around
    the degrees of freedom and sample variance estmates. Student’s assumes that both
    samples have the same variance, while Welch’s does not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When comparing large sample sizes (n > 10,000) for a hypothesis test using either
    Welch’s t-test or Student’s t-test, the difference in significance levels between
    the two tests is typically negligible. This is because the Student’s t-test assumption
    of equal variances has minimal impact on the test’s accuracy when dealing with
    large sample sizes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if the assumption of equal variances is violated, the Student’s t-test
    remains relatively robust, meaning it produces accurate p-values and maintains
    the desired type I error rate (the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis).
    This robustness is due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that as the
    sample size increases, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution,
    regardless of the underlying population distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, Welch’s t-test is specifically designed to handle unequal variances,
    making it more appropriate when the assumption of equal variances is questionable.
    However, for large sample sizes, the difference in significance levels between
    Welch’s t-test and Student’s t-test is usually minimal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are concerned about the potential for unequal variances, Welch’s t-test
    is a safer choice. However, if you want to maximise power and are confident that
    the sample size is large enough, Student’s t-test can be used.

    are independent, however, their joint ratio is not. This violates the assumptions
    of independence of the Student’s and Welch’s t-test.

    the choice of the right statistical test is essential. For robust and reliable
    results, data scientists should carefully consider the characteristics and test
    assumptions.
