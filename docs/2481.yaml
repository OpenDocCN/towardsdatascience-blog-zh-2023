- en: Most people working with data make observations and then wonder whether these
    observations are statistically significant. And unless one has some formal training
    on statistical inference and past experience in running significance tests, the
    first thought that comes to mind is to find a statistician who can provide advice
    on how to conduct the test, or at least confirm that the test has been executed
    correctly and that the results are valid.

  zh: 大多数从事数据工作的人会进行观察，然后思考这些观察是否具有统计学意义。除非有人接受过正式的统计推断培训，并且有过执行显著性检验的经验，否则首先想到的就是找一位统计学家，寻求如何进行检验的建议，或者至少确认检验是否正确执行以及结果是否有效。
- en: There are many reasons for this. For a start, it is often not immediately obvious
    which test is needed, which formulas underpin the test principles, how to use
    the formulas, and whether the test can be used in the first place, e.g. because
    the data do not fulfil necessary conditions such as normality. There are comprehensive
    R and Python packages for the estimation of a wealth of statistical models and
    for conducting statistical tests, such as [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这有很多原因。首先，通常不容易立即明确需要哪种测试，哪些公式支撑测试原理，如何使用这些公式，以及测试是否可以使用，例如，因为数据不满足如正态性等必要条件。对于估计各种统计模型和进行统计测试，有全面的
    R 和 Python 包，例如 [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)。
- en: Still, without full appreciation of the statistical theory, using a package
    by replicating an example from the user guide often leaves a lingering sense of
    insecurity, in anticipation of severe criticism once the approach is scrutinised
    by a seasoned statistician. Personally, I am an engineer that turned into a data
    analyst over time. I had statistics courses during my undergraduate and postgraduate
    studies, but I did not use statistics extensively because this is not typically
    what an engineer does for a living. I believe the same applies to many other data
    analysts and data scientists, particularly if their formal training is for example
    in engineering, computer science or chemistry.

  zh: 尽管如此，如果没有对统计理论的全面理解，使用包通过复制用户指南中的示例，常常会留下持续的不安，担心一旦方法被经验丰富的统计学家审查会受到严厉批评。就个人而言，我是一个随着时间的推移转变为数据分析师的工程师。我在本科和研究生阶段有过统计课程，但我并没有广泛使用统计学，因为这通常不是工程师的工作。我相信许多其他数据分析师和数据科学家也是如此，特别是如果他们的正式培训例如是在工程、计算机科学或化学方面。
- en: I decided to write this article because I came recently to the realisation that
    simulation can be readily used in place of more classical formula-based statistical
    methods. Most people would probably think immediately of bootstrapping to estimate
    the uncertainly of the mean. But it is not only about bootstrapping. Using resampling
    within random permutation tests can provide answers to many statistical inference
    problems. Such tests are generally not very difficult to write and execute. They
    apply universally to continuous or binary data, regardless of sample sizes and
    without making assumptions about the data distribution. In this sense, permutation
    tests are non-parametric and the only requirement is exchangeability, i.e. the
    probability to observe a certain sequence of values is the same for any permutation
    of the sequence. This is really not much to ask.

  zh: 我决定写这篇文章，因为我最近意识到模拟可以很容易地替代更经典的基于公式的统计方法。大多数人可能会立即想到自助法来估计均值的不确定性。但这不仅仅是自助法。使用在随机置换测试中进行重复抽样可以为许多统计推断问题提供答案。这类测试通常不难编写和执行。它们普遍适用于连续或二元数据，无论样本大小如何，也不对数据分布做假设。从这个意义上讲，置换测试是非参数的，唯一的要求是可交换性，即观察到某个值序列的概率对于该序列的任何置换都是相同的。这真的不算多要求。
- en: The unavailability of computing resources was perhaps one of the reasons for
    the impressive advancement of formula-based statistical inference tests in the
    past. Resampling thousands of times a data sample with tens or thousands of records
    was prohibitive back then, but it is not prohibitive anymore. Does this mean that
    classical statistical inference methods are not needed any more? Of course not.
    But having the ability to run a permutation test and confirm the results can be
    re-assuring when the results are similar, or help understand which assumptions
    do not hold when we observe discrepancies. Being able to run a statistical test
    from scratch without relying on a package also gives some sense of empowerment.

  zh: 计算资源的缺乏可能是过去基于公式的统计推断测试取得显著进展的原因之一。当时重复抽样数千次包含几十或几千条记录的数据样本是不可行的，但现在已不再不可行。这是否意味着经典的统计推断方法不再需要？当然不是。但能够进行置换测试并确认结果相似，或者帮助理解观察到的差异时哪些假设不成立，这可以令人安心。从头开始运行统计测试而不依赖于包也能带来一定的掌控感。
- en: Permutation tests are of course nothing new, but I thought it is a good idea
    to provide some examples and the corresponding code. This may alleviate the fear
    of some data experts out there and bring statistical inference using simulation
    closer to their everyday practice. The article uses permutation tests for answering
    two questions. There are many more scenarios when a permutation test can be used
    and for more complex questions the design of a permutation test may not be immediately
    obvious. In this sense, this article is not comprehensive. However, the principles
    are the same. By understanding the basics it will be easier to look up an authoritative
    source on how to design a permutation test for answering other, more nuanced,
    business questions. My intention is to trigger a way of thinking where simulating
    the population distribution is at the centre and using the theoretical draws allows
    estimating what is the probability of an observed effect to occur by chance. This
    is what hypothesis tests are about.

  zh: 排列检验当然不是什么新鲜事，但我认为提供一些示例和相应的代码是个好主意。这可以缓解一些数据专家的恐惧，并将基于模拟的统计推断带入他们的日常实践。本文使用排列检验来回答两个问题。还有许多场景可以使用排列检验，对于更复杂的问题，排列检验的设计可能并不显而易见。从这个意义上说，本文并不全面。然而，原则是相同的。理解基础知识将更容易查找权威来源来设计排列检验以回答其他更微妙的商业问题。我的意图是激发一种思维方式，将模拟总体分布作为核心，并利用理论抽样来估计观察到的效应是偶然发生的概率。这就是假设检验的核心。
- en: Statistical inference starts with a hypothesis, e.g. a new drug is more effective
    against a given disease compared to the traditional treatment. Effectiveness could
    be measured by checking the reduction of a given blood index (continuous variable)
    or by counting the number of animals in which disease cannot be detected following
    treatment (discrete variable) when using the new drug and the traditional treatment
    (control). Such two-group comparisons, also known as A/B tests, are discussed
    extensively in all classical statistics texts and in popular tech blogs such as
    this [one](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/what-is-an-a-b-test-b08cc1b57962).
    Using the drug design example, we will test if the new drug is more effective
    compared to the traditional treatment (A/B testing). Building on this, we will
    estimate how many animals we need to establish that the new drug is more effective
    assuming that in reality it is 1% more effective (or for another effect size)
    than the traditional treatment. Although the two questions seem unrelated, they
    are not. We will be reusing code from the first to answer the second. All code
    can be found in my blog [repository](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/StatisticalExperimentsWithResampling).

  zh: 统计推断始于一个假设，例如，新药对某种疾病的疗效比传统治疗更佳。效果可以通过检查某个血液指标（连续变量）的减少情况，或通过统计接受新药和传统治疗（对照组）后无法检测到疾病的动物数量（离散变量）来测量。这样的两组比较，也称为
    A/B 测试，在所有经典统计学教材和流行技术博客中都有广泛讨论，比如这个[链接](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/what-is-an-a-b-test-b08cc1b57962)。以药物设计为例，我们将测试新药是否比传统治疗更有效（A/B
    测试）。基于此，我们将估计需要多少动物来确认新药比传统治疗有效1%（或其他效应大小）。虽然这两个问题看似无关，但其实并非如此。我们将重用第一个问题的代码来回答第二个问题。所有代码可以在我的博客[仓库](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/StatisticalExperimentsWithResampling)中找到。

- en: Let’s come back to the first question, i.e. whether the new drug is more effective
    than the traditional treatment. When we run an experiment, ill animals are assigned
    to two groups, depending on which treatment they receive. The animals are assigned
    to groups randomly and hence any observed difference in the treatment efficacy
    is because of drug effectiveness, or because it just happened by chance that the
    animals with the stronger immune system were assigned to the new drug group. These
    are the two situations that we need to untangle. In other words, we want to examine
    if random chance can explain any observed benefits in using the new drug.

  zh: 回到第一个问题，即新药是否比传统治疗更有效。当我们进行实验时，生病的动物被分配到两个组中，具体取决于它们接受哪种治疗。动物被随机分配到各组，因此任何观察到的治疗效果差异要么是由于药物的有效性，要么是因为随机分配的结果使得免疫系统较强的动物被分配到了新药组。这两种情况是我们需要解开的。换句话说，我们想要检验随机机会是否能够解释使用新药所观察到的任何好处。

- en: We intentionally do not use treatment groups of the same size, as this is not
    a requirement for the permutation test. This hypothetical A/B test involved a
    large number of animals and it seems that the new drug is promising. The new drug
    is 1.5% more effective than the traditional treatment. Given the large sample,
    this appears significant. We will come back to this. As humans, we tend to see
    as significant things that may not be. This is why standardising hypothesis tests
    is so important.

    This is also known as the null hypothesis. The person running the test usually
    hopes to prove that the null hypothesis does not hold, i.e. that a discovery has
    been made. In other words, the alternative hypothesis is true. One way of prove
    this is to show that random chance has a very low probability of leading to a
    difference as extreme as the observed one. We are already starting to see the
    connection with the permutation testing.

  zh: 在A/B测试中，我们使用一个基线假设，即没有观察到任何特殊情况。这也被称为零假设。进行测试的人通常希望证明零假设不成立，即发现了某种效果。换句话说，替代假设是真实的。证明这一点的一种方法是显示随机机会导致观察到的差异的概率非常低。我们已经开始看到与置换检验的关联。
- en: Imagine a procedure where all animals treated are pooled together into a single
    group (of 2487 + 1785 animals) and then split again randomly into two groups with
    the same sizes as two original treatment groups. For each animal we know if the
    treatment was successful or not and hence we can calculate the percentage of animals
    cured for each group. Using the observed data, we established that the new drug
    increased the percentage of cured animals from 80.34 to 81.79%, i.e. an increase
    of almost 1.5%. If we resample the two groups many times, how often would we see
    that the new drug leads to a greater percentage of animals being cured compared
    to the traditional treatment? This “how often” is the ubiquitous p-value in statistical
    inference. If it happens often, i.e. the p-value is larger than a threshold we
    are comfortable with (the also ubiquitous significance level, often 5%), then
    what we saw in the experiment can be due to chance and hence the null hypothesis
    is not rejected. If it happens rarely, then chance alone cannot lead to the observed
    difference and hence the null hypothesis is rejected (and you can organise a party
    if your team discovered the new drug!). If you observe carefully what we actually
    did with the permutations is to simulate the null hypothesis, i.e. that the two
    treatment groups are equivalent.

- en: Think again about how the null hypothesis has been formulated, as this determines
    how the permutation testing will be conducted. In the example above, we want to
    see how often chance would make us believe that the alternative hypothesis is
    true, i.e. the new drug is more effective. This means that the null hypothesis,
    which is complementary to the alternative hypothesis, states that the new drug
    is less efficient or as efficient as the traditional treatment. This is also known
    as one-way test (vs. a two-way test, also known as a bi-directional test). Think
    of this in another way. We do not want to be fooled by random chance into believing
    that the new drug is more effective. Being fooled in the other direction does
    not matter, because we do not intend to replace the traditional treatment anyway.
    The two-way test would lead to higher p-values and is hence more conservative
    because it has a greater chance rejecting the null hypothesis. However, this does
    not mean that it should be used if it is not the right test to use.

    protected us against a false positive (also known as a Type 1 error); but it could

  zh: 还是有一些乐观的理由。我们刚刚进行的 A/B 测试有两种可能的结果：要么存在效果（在我们的案例中，新药比传统治疗更有效），要么没有足够的证据来得出存在效果的结论。测试并没有得出没有效果的结论。新药仍可能更有效。只是我们目前无法在选择的显著性水平下用现有数据证明这一点。测试实质上保护我们免于假阳性（也称为第一类错误）；但可能存在假阴性（也称为第二类错误）。这是团队所希望的。
- en: There is another question we could ask. What would the observed difference need
    to be to conclude that the new drug is more effective than the traditional treatment?
    Clearly 1.5% is not sufficient, but how much would be sufficient? The answer can
    be readily obtained from the produced histogram. We can “move” the vertical line
    corresponding to the observed difference to the right, until the tail with the
    red bars accounts for 5% of the total area; or in other words use the 95% percentile
    `np.percentile(differences, 95)`, which gives 0.0203 or 2.03%. A bit more than
    the 1.5% we observed unfortunately, but not terribly off.

  zh: 我们还可以问另一个问题。观察到的差异需要达到多少才能得出新药比传统治疗更有效的结论？显然1.5%是不够的，但多少才算足够呢？答案可以从生成的直方图中直接获得。我们可以将对应于观察到的差异的垂直线向右“移动”，直到红色条形的尾部占总面积的5%；换句话说，使用95%百分位数`np.percentile(differences,
    95)`，其值为0.0203或2.03%。比我们观察到的1.5%多一点，虽然不太理想，但也不算太离谱。
- en: 'Using a significance level of 0.05, we would not reject the null hypothesis
    if the increase in the treatment effectiveness with the new drug is in the interval
    (-∞, 0.0203]. This is also known as the confidence interval: the set of values
    of the observed statistic that would not reject the null hypothesis. Because we
    used a 5% significance level this is a 95% confidence interval. Assuming that
    the new drug is not more efficient, then running the experiment multiple times
    would give a difference in effectiveness within the confidence interval 95% of
    the times. This is what the confidence interval tells us. The p-value will exceed
    *a* if and only if the confidence interval contains the observed effectiveness
    increase that means that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. These two ways
    of checking whether the null hypothesis can be rejected are of course equivalent.'

  zh: 使用0.05的显著性水平，如果新药治疗效果的增加在区间（-∞, 0.0203]中，我们将不会拒绝原假设。这也被称为置信区间：观察到的统计量值的集合，这些值不会拒绝原假设。由于我们使用了5%的显著性水平，这就是95%的置信区间。假设新药没有更高的效率，那么多次进行实验将会在95%的时间内得到置信区间内的效果差异。这就是置信区间告诉我们的信息。p值将超过*a*，当且仅当置信区间包含观察到的效果增加，这意味着原假设不能被拒绝。这两种检查原假设是否可以被拒绝的方法当然是等效的。
- en: With the number of animals tested so far we cannot reject the null hypothesis,
    but we are not very far from the confidence interval bound. The team is optimistic,
    but we need to collect more compelling evidence that the new drug is more effective.
    But how much more evidence? We will revisit this in the next section, as running
    a simulation with resampling can help us answering this question too!

- en: Before we conclude this section, it is important to note that we could also
    use a classical statistical test to approximate the p-value. The table presented
    above is also known as contingency table, which provides the interrelation between
    two variables and can be used to establish whether there is an interaction between
    them. The independence of the two variables can be examined using a [chi-square
    test starting from the contingency matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html)
    but care is needed not to run a two-sided test (did not try extensively, but scipy
    seems to use a two-sided as the default; this will lead to higher p-values). We
    could also use the [Fisher exact, one-sided test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.fisher_exact.html)
    that would yield a p-value of 0.124 that is not very different from the one calculated
    with sampling. Increasing the number of permutations will likely converge to this
    value. Isn’t it nice to know how to run a permutation test before delving into
    the user guide of statistical libraries?

  zh: 在我们结束这一部分之前，重要的是要注意我们还可以使用经典统计测试来近似p值。上面展示的表格也被称为列联表，它提供了两个变量之间的相互关系，并且可以用来确定它们之间是否存在交互作用。可以使用[从列联矩阵开始的卡方检验](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html)来检查这两个变量的独立性，但需要小心不要运行双侧检验（虽然没有广泛尝试，但scipy似乎默认使用双侧检验；这将导致更高的p值）。我们也可以使用[Fisher精确的单侧检验](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.fisher_exact.html)，这会得出一个p值为0.124，与通过采样计算的值差异不大。增加置换次数可能会趋向于这个值。在深入了解统计库用户指南之前，了解如何运行置换检验岂不是很棒？

- en: 'Power is the probability of detecting a given effect size for a given sample
    size and level of significance. Let’s say that we expect the new drug to increase
    the treatment effectiveness by 1.5% compared to the traditional treatment. Assuming
    that we have treated 3000 animals with each treatment and fixed the level of significance
    to 0.05, the power of the test is 80%. This means that if we repeat the experiment
    many times we will see that in 4 out of 5 experiments we conclude that the new
    drug is more effective than the traditional treatment. In other words, the rate
    of false negatives (Type II error) is 20%. The numbers above are of course hypothetical.
    What is important is that the four quantities: sample size, effect size, level
    of significance and power are related and setting any three of them allows the
    fourth one to be computed. The most typical scenario is to compute the sample
    size from the other three. This is what we investigate in this section. As a simplification,

    II错误）为20%。上述数字当然是理论上的。重要的是，样本大小、效应量、显著性水平和功效这四个量是相关的，设置其中的任何三个可以计算出第四个。最典型的情况是从其他三个量计算样本大小。这就是我们在本节中要研究的内容。作为简化，我们假设在每个实验中我们用新药和传统治疗处理相同数量的动物。

    If the effect size is larger, i.e. 2%, we would need to work less as ~4500 animals
    would suffice. This is intuitive. It is easier to detect a large effect than a
    small effect. Deciding on running such a large experiment requires a cost/benefit
    analysis but at least now we know what it takes to prove that the new drug is
    more effective.

    the p-value that is increasingly being criticized. The truth is that the importance
    of the p-value has historically been exaggerated. The p-value indicates how incompatible
    the data are with a statistical model or permutation test representing the null
    hypothesis. The p-value is not the probability that the alternative hypothesis
    is true. Moreover, a p-value that shows that the null value can be rejected does
    not mean that the size of the effect is important. A small effect size may be
    statistically significant, but it is so small that this is not important.

    值不是替代假设真实的概率。此外，显示零假设可以被拒绝的 p 值并不意味着效应大小很重要。小的效应大小可能在统计上显著，但其效果如此微小，以至于不具实际意义。
