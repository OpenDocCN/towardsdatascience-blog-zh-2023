    behavior. Third-party tools are great for exploratory purposes but often lack
    flexibility and getting access to raw data could be challenging — and this is
    ultimately what you want to get, *the raw data*. Once you have raw data, you can
    start modeling user behavior and use those models across different systems in
    your e-commerce business — systems which are not connected directly — *product
    and CRM by creating a comprehensive user journey, product and marketing, operations,
    post-order service and so on.* You can think about those models as a meta-layer
    that can be fed into your systems.

    say that *some events are more rare than others*. For example, typical e-commerce
    user conversion rate can be benchmarked at around [2.5–3%](https://www.bigcommerce.com/articles/ecommerce/conversion-rate-optimization/)
    in a regular business as usual time. Therefore, a *purchase* being an ultimate
    “destination” in a funnel can also be an *indicator of its efficiency*. Going
    bottom-up, less users will start a checkout compared to those who viewed a cart.
    You’ll also have some “bouncer” users who only visit a homepage and do not take
    any “meaningful” actions on the website such as PLP or PDP views. It wouldn’t
    be a far reach to say that the more “rare” an event in the high-level e-commerce
    funnel, the more weight it carries in terms of purchase signaling. Moreover, if
    a user has entered the bottom of the funnel and simply dropped off, we may have
    a strong reason to reach out in attempts to facilitate or promote movement down
    the funnel.

    a weight to every signal and add those up*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aggregating signals into one can be a creative process. It’s important to note
    that *each signal has different value* and importance when it comes to signaling
    the probability of conversion. Because as the users go deeper down the funnel,
    they usually demonstrate a stronger intent to convert. One way to assign weight
    to each signal is through *expert attribution*, where a percentage of weight is
    agreed upon for each action such as product use, product clicks, or add to cart
    events. For example, a rare action like an add to cart event would be assigned
    a higher weight, such as 50%, while a common action like a product impression
    would be assigned a lower weight, such as 10%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way of assigning weight to signals is by looking at *historical data*,
    and taking into account how customer behavior and the seasonality of the business
    may affect the signaling potential of certain actions. We automate the weight
    assignment by the share of customers who’ve performed a certain action on our
    app or website. Based on the exploratory data analysis, we have figured out that
    the more rare an event is, the higher conversion rate is associated with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speaking of seasonality, some events may become more frequent during significant
    e-commerce events such as Black Friday. More users would engage into window shopping
    and use their cart as a wishlist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To smooth out this effect, we decided to take a three-day rolling estimation
    of the number of users who engaged or showed any of the signals that we used for
    our funnel. This share represents the frequency of an event, so to quantify the
    rarity, we simply subtract the percentage from 100%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an example, if 99% of users engage into PLP or product listing page browsing,
    then the weight of the number of PLP impressions would be 100–99% which is 1%.
    If 30% of users add items to cart, then the weight of the add to cart signal would
    be estimated as one 100-30%, which is 70%. And so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the weights are assigned, the signals can be added up to create a single
    score. This score may not have a defined range, as it can fluctuate depending
    on the day, so it will be hard to compare signals across days. To avoid this,
    the score can be normalized between 0 and 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    between different customer groups when it comes to conversion rate and revenue

    within an expected period, based on the exploratory data analysis, we want to
    prioritize them in our comms and maybe offer a monetary reward. Below average
    users may benefit
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    rates as well as revenue per user for each of the segments, the results were quite
    promising. Results for the conversion rate (CR) can be expected, however, seeing
    the higher in revenue per converted user (RPU) was not something expected. This
    could mean that more active users are more engaged with the product and are ready
    to shop cross-category, increase basket size by either shopping for more items
    or for items at a higher price.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One reason is a lack of data. Data science models often require large amounts
    of data to be trained effectively. If you don’t have enough data, a simple model
    may be more appropriate because it will be less prone to overfitting and may be
    more likely to generalize to new data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason is interpretability. Simple models are often easier to understand
    and interpret, especially for people who are not data scientists. This can be
    especially important in situations where the results of the model need to be explained
    to non-technical stakeholders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, simple models can also be faster to deliver. Data science models can
    take a long time to train, especially if you have a lot of data. Simple models
    can often be trained and implemented much more quickly, which can be important
    if you need to get a solution in place in a short amount of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, there are trade-offs to be considered when deciding between a simple
    data model and a more complex data science model. In some cases, a simple model

    to achieve the desired level of accuracy and performance.
  prefs: []

    your users based on their in-app behavior. It’s easy enough to implement and iterate
    on but even in this easy implementation, will be helpful to spot and keep the
    most promising customers within the business. Because as we all know, understanding
    user behavior is a key aspect of creating effective CRM, marketing and product
    strategies, and can help you to increase business revenues and improve the overall
