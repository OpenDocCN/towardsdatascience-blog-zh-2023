- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) projects have the potential to revolutionize organizations,
    but successfully shipping AI projects to production requires a strong DevOps foundation.
    This post is designed for teams starting their AI strategy or first AI projects.
    If you’re experimenting with AI models just for fun, great! But if your goal is
    to eventually make the model accessible to customers (internal or external), this
    post is for you.

- en: As an AI Solution Architect, I’ve seen countless groups decide to invest in
    AI, build models, and then not ship a single model for months — or years! Often,
    the group has no clear path to getting models out the door. It can be frustrating
    to see a model come so close to impacting business value, only to stop just short
    of the finish line.

    “Have a model.” Your goal is “Have people using the model.” DevOps is the boundary
    between dev work and people using products. Don’t let great experiments go to
    waste by failing to turn them into great products.
