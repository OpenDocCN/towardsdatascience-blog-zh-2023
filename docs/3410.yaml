- en: Retraining machine learning models, especially those focused on customer churn
    prediction, is an essential step to ensure their relevancy and accuracy over time.
    However, retraining churn models presents unique challenges that need special
    attention. Among the most notable is distinguishing between causal effects of
    interventions — identify customers who stayed due to the proactive retention program
    to target them exclusively.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge is that we can’t determine which category individuals fall into.
    We can’t simultaneously treat them and have them in the control group. So, how
    could we identify them? how could we know if they were persuaded or did not intend
    to churn in the first place? This is where uplift modeling steps in.
  prefs: []

    the ‘Transformed Outcome’ method. this method requires data from both a control

    regression one.

    of customer behavior must adapt. Embracing this dynamic situation, continually
    refining models, and staying attuned to the shifting patterns will be the key
    of successful churn prediction and management in the future.
