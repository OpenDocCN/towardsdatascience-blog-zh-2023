    Machine Learning Engineers](/machine-learning-engineers-what-do-they-actually-do-e666081c3181),
    I thought I would write a bit about what I think are the real categories of roles
    for data science practitioners in the job market. While I was previously talking
    about the candidates, e.g. what their qualification expectations and realities
    might be, today I want to talk about what the actual job is day to day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    professionals to do, whether they admit it or not. I am going to explain what
    the job really does, as opposed to what the claims might be in the job description,
    and where in a business org chart (roughly) you might be located.

    to read between the lines when we review postings and job descriptions. There’s
    going to be a lot of fluff and euphemism in a job description, and it can be hard
    to tell what the role really would be like day to day, and what skills you will
    need to be successful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also important to know what the tasks will look like so you can tell if
    this is what you want to spend your time doing! You probably have parts of the
    broad field of data science you like more than others, and things you want to
    learn more or get into more deeply. If you end up in the wrong role, you can find
    your career going somewhere you don’t want to be.

    know what the job really is going to be before you spend time applying and interviewing.
    It’s also important to know, as you read between the lines, whether the role being
    advertised is really manageable for one person to do successfully. As I describe
    later, sometimes companies try to hire one data scientist to do many jobs, and
    it’s not sustainable or pleasant for the person who gets hired for that role.

    and don’t have personal experience in Big Tech. I consulted friends who do have
    such experience to get their feedback for this, so I hope my generalizations more
    or less apply anywhere. I’m probably wrong.

    You are there to help the company figure out whether they are meeting goals, and
    whether stuff is working the way it should. This is incredibly important and super
    nebulous and hard to actually do. There are a ton of possible things you could
    be doing day to day, such as building dashboards, analyzing things like sales
    and product success, and potentially also looking at things like internal performance
    (think turnover and stuff). Some people will think your job is just “make me a
    dashboard” but even if you do dashboarding, you’ll spend a lot of time thinking
    about what should be measured in the dashboard, whether it should exist at all,
    and how you can calculate metrics that will actually align with goals.
  prefs: []

- en: In a prior decade, you might have been called things like Operations Analyst
    or BI Specialist (or sometimes even now you might be called this). You are expected
    to handle a lot of weird data from weird sources, and you also use a LOT of SQL.
    You will not be doing much machine learning unless it is stuff like NLP on feedback
    responses. If you’re analyzing product effectiveness, you will do a lot of A/B
    testing. You might be in the marketing department or in a standalone analytics
    department, but everyone from all over the business is probably going to be up
    in your grill asking for “the numbers” for stuff a lot.

    sort of DS/ML wizardry. Your executives probably want to be able to say your product
    contains AI, even if you just have a recommendation engine surfacing suggestions
    in the product, or sorting your search results. If you are lucky you might get
    to build innovative features and add cool stuff to the product — but if you don’t
    do well starting from an empty page and a vague mandate, this may not be the right
    place for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to learn about the customers and industry so you can build stuff that
    is useful, not just cool. You should listen to what customers say and talk to
    departments that are customer facing, but often times people in this role won’t.
    (This is a bad choice.) You might be doing your own A/B testing, or that might
    fall on The Analytics Guru. You definitely need the Analytics Guru (or overlap
    with them) when it comes to evaluating whether the stuff you built was any good.
    You work in Python. You are probably in the product department, but you talk to
    engineering a lot.

    will be asked to make the pipes that take a new model and stick it into the product
    so that the search results are ordered by relevance or the new widget is surfaced
    for the appropriate people or whatever. Sometimes you’ll have your hands in the
    workings of a model itself, but not that often (unless it breaks and you get paged
    — you’re the most likely kind of data scientist to have an on-call rotation shift.)
    Scaling and parallelization are going to be important to you, and you need to
    develop a deep fascination with latency and lag, so get used to that.
  prefs: []

- en: Your daily toolkit includes Docker, whatever language the product is written
    in, and Python, because you are taking whatever The Feature Builder makes and
    plugging it into the product. Some kind of observability tool is also high in
    your bookmarks. You probably are in an engineering department, or maybe devops.

    who is building ML tools for other internal departments at your company to use.
    It isn’t that different from The Feature Builder except that the models you make
    are just for use inside your business, to make things work better. Your customers
    are the other people who work at your company, not outside people who pay your
    company money for goods/services. As a result, you don’t need to know that much
    about the external customers, but you will know the company org chart pretty well.

- en: To succeed, find out what annoying repetitive stuff your colleagues have to
    do and automate it/train a model to do it for them. If you do, you will be very
    popular. Sometimes stuff you create will get open sourced and eventually could
    turn into products, like Airflow or H3\. You probably are in engineering.

    to write scholarly articles and raise the profile of your company, or something
    like that, but they are not expecting this role to earn its own keep. This role
    probably falls under the CEO’s special projects or something like that. You will
    get tossed ideas that someone reads about online that seem cool, and get asked
    to figure out what it’s all about, and how your company can do something in that
    space. You get tagged in all the slack conversations about LLMs. [This is the
    only possible role in this entire post that *might* justifiably look for a Ph.D.](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/your-data-scientist-does-not-need-a-stem-ph-d-7f2206f43871)

    them for your customers. This includes data science consulting gigs, although
    companies that build and sell software related to data science are also where
    this role is commonly found. If your customers need specialized DS/ML talent to
    make best use of your product, then it’s likely the company will have some of
    these roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Expect to get brought in to customer calls when they’re trying to sell somebody
    on the AI whiz-bang elements of your product or services, because Sales isn’t
    comfortable answering technical questions. You have a pretty diverse tech stack
    skill set because your customers can rock up with all kinds of weird stuff for
    you to help with/build, which can actually be really fun. You need to understand
    the industry, like The Feature Builder, and you have to be able to be polished
    and patient with customers. Because you spend time interacting with customers,
    you may be in the customer success or sales departments.

    in haphazard ways, and either the hiring manager doesn’t realize this is three
    or four jobs or they are hoping they can convince someone to do all that for just
    one salary. The salary is probably too low for what you’ll be asked to do. This
    is common in organizations without an existing data science function, who are
    hiring their first DS person. It can be an opportunity to learn a ton by doing,
    but there’s likely not going to be anyone more technically skilled around to teach
    you, so your Google/StackOverflow/other searching skills need to be top notch.
    If you don’t love teaching yourself new stuff, this role can be difficult and
    isolating. As a friend of mine said, “You’ll be the best at the company at what
    you do, but that doesn’t mean you’re good at those things.” Because of the lack
    of mentorship/people to help you out, burnout is a real risk.

    be The Analytics Guru, The Feature Builder, and The Infra Builder, for example-
    that’s just too many plates to keep spinning. The smaller the company, the more
    likely you will end up having to wear extra hats, but recognize that these are
    different functions and you can get spread too thin.

    roles and the boundaries of “what’s my job” get fuzzier and grayer. You develop
    expertise and experience that can be useful in lots of different parts of the
    business, and people will call to get your thoughts about stuff.

    probably have seen something like whatever idea or problem is currently on the
    table before. You should give your opinions about how to tackle it, even if people
    in charge go a different way. This is just part of the job at more senior levels.
