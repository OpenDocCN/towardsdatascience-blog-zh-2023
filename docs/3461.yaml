- en: Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast volumes of text data, has sparked
    a revolution in AI. Their ability to generate remarkably eloquent, coherent language
    simply from a short text prompt has opened up new horizons across domains from
    creative writing to conversational assistants.

- en: However, mastery of linguistic expression alone does not equate true intelligence.
    LLMs still lack semantic understanding of concepts and logical reasoning abilities
    required for situational comprehension and complex problem solving. Their knowledge
    remains confined to superficial patterns discerned from training corpora rather
    than grounded facts about the real world.

- en: As we pose more open-ended, multifaceted questions to these models, their limitations
    become increasingly apparent. They cannot logically synthesize details from different
    documents or make inferences spanning multiple steps to derive answers.

    or contradictory responses start emerging.

    augmented generative (RAG) frameworks. These systems aim to synergize the linguistic
    prowess of language…
