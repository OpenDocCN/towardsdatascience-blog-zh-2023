    that the Zombie Apocalypse he had watched many times in series and movies was
    finally on his front porch. He could wait hidden in the garage for some time but
    had to come out eventually. Should he take an axe with him or would the rifle
    be enough? He could try to find some food but, should he go alone? He tried to
    remember all the zombie movies he had seen but could not agree on a single strategy.
    If he only had a way of remembering every scene where a character is killed by
    zombies, would that be enough to increase his chances of survival? If he just
    had a decision guide everything would be simpler…*'

- en: Have you ever watched one of those zombie apocalypse movies where there is one
    character that always seems to know where the zombies are hidden or if it is better
    to fight with them or run away? Does this person really know what is going to
    happen? Did someone tell him/her beforehand? Maybe there is nothing magical about
    this. Maybe this person has read a lot of comics about zombies and it is really
    good at knowing what to…
