    other words, confidently produce incorrect results. This can be challenging as
    [we often conflate well reasoned arguments with correct ones](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-analysis-dies).

    around making GenAI work in very specific domains that are not general purpose…I
    think all these things are still significant challenges,” said Tomasz.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s not just hallucinations however. Like analytical dashboards and machine
    learning applications, generative AI models will only be as reliable and trustworthy
    as the underlying data it is accessing or being trained on. These aren’t new problems,
    but they will be more prevalent and require more scalable solutions.

    to put it together, to answer the business questions [when you have] fewer analysts
    in the loop is going to exacerbate some of the governance issues that exist today,”
    said Lior. “How do you identify what data sets are trustworthy, which ones are
    useful, and how do you have the right metadata and documentation to make the data
    useful for a model?”

    understand the underlying data.

    knows about the rest of the world, well, the rest of the world doesn’t know how
    you interpret your business,” said Kristen. “Where do you impart a business logic
    into your data stack that serves every subsequent layer? I think having curated
    some key rules around your business, whether it’s entity related or relationship
    embedded, at the ground layer of your data stack is gonna serve both [model speed
    and accuracy].”
