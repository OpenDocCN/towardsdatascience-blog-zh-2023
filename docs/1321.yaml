    a reference was present (“O”), 2\. if we could accurately predict the beginning
    of a reference (“B-ref”), and 3\. can we detect that we are inside a reference
    (“I-ref”). This meant that we were closer to how an operator would improve their
    work by being indicated where a reference is present rather than optimizing for
    the start and stop of the identified segment. These results were much more promising:'

    higher: if you look at the resulting model performance, these could be described
    as true positives in the regulations. For instance, the model will highlight “the
    Code”, which is in relation to a previous mention of an IBR.*'

- en: While skipping over the details of accessibility and platform design (we used
    a Laravel frontend with a Flask backend — it was 2018, after all), we built a
    simple platform that could ingest the regulatory stock, search for regulations,
    and identify in context the specific incorporations by reference that existed
    inside the regulations.

- en: This frontend was where a lot of requirements started getting clarified and
    adjusted as the clients saw what the tool could do.

- en: As we were closing off many of the features in the contract, we started noticing
    the limits of the content in the regulatory stock. that certain ancillary features
    could not be achieved due to insufficient candidate examples in the data. (For
    example, there was a line item tied to static vs. ambulatory references — usually
    referred to with a “*[…] the latest version of […]*” — but our initial search
    only found 5 examples of ambulatory references. )

    data has been evaluated and the models built. In this case, many conversations
    were had about the utility of the tool against contract expectations (based on
    the reality of the data), which allowed us to whittle away at the platform and
    ensure that the code delivered actually addresses the regulation drafters’ core
    concerns.

    was simply: *does it work?* That question had many technical sublayers to it (with
    the *beginning* and *inner* metrics listed above), but the key business case was
    further clarified: *Does the tool allow a reviewer to identify *****all**** *of
    the third-party references in a regulation?*'

    weeks of discussion, they confirmed that **our tool had not missed a single incorporation
    by reference.** We kept up post-project quality control to ensure no outstanding
    issues, but our work here was done. ❤️
