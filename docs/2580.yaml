    a unique opportunity for you to learn how others view you while also gaining insights
    into yourself. Most laws are similar to the European Union’s [General Data Protection
    Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504),
    commonly know as “GDPR”. It includes provisions requiring organizations to tell
    you the type of personal data they store about you, why they are storing it, how
    they are using it, and the length of time they store it.

    **data portability**. Data portability requires organizations to give you a machine-readable
    copy of the data they are currently storing about you upon request. In the GDPR,
    this right is defined in Article 15, *“Right of access by the data subject”*.
    The data that organizations have often includes a rich and varied set of features
    and is clean, making it ripe for several data analysis, modelling, and visualization
    tasks.
