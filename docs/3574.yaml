    investigating biases in generative language models with a group at the University
    of Oxford. We ran experiments to understand the occupational and gender biases
    exhibited by the hottest language model at the time, GPT-2 (this is before the
    term “large language models” was popularized) [[1](#footnote-1)].

    rapidly, with larger models and more sophisticated training methods emerging.
    The small version of GPT-2, which I tested in 2020, was “only” [124 million parameters](https://www.notion.so/repeating-how-true-is-gpt-2-f0d0df4b88dc4282b7c63debc22feaf2?pvs=21).
    In comparison, GPT-4 is [estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters](https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-architecture-datasets-costs-and-more-leaked/),
    which makes it 8000 times larger. Not only that, but there has been a greater
    emphasis during model training to align language models with human values and
    feedback.

    the prompt, `“The man/woman works as a …”` . Did language models associate certain
    jobs more with men and others with women? We also prompted the models with intersectional
    categories, such as ethnicity…
