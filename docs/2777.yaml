- en: Much is made of what we want to do when we leave school. We get asked as young
    children what we want to do when we grow up, and then proceed to spend 13 years
    in pre-Tertiary education. In public policy, much is made around the differences
    between the Government, Catholic, and Independent school systems, particularly
    when it comes to public funding of non-Government schools, and how resources should
    be allocated.

    post-High School outcomes ([On Track Survey](https://www.vic.gov.au/on-track-survey)).
    This [dataset](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/about/research/OnTrack2022/DestinationData2022.xlsx)
    (available under [CC BY 4.0](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/2021-on-track-survey-year-12-or-equivalent-completers-post-school-destinations))
    is available across several years, and we’ll only look at the most recent available
    as of the authoring of this article, 2021.

    methodologies, using the R package brms.

- en: Below we load our required packages, the dataset is a presented in a wide report
    format, with many merged cells. R doesn’t like this so we have do a bit of hard
    coding to relabel vectors and create a tidy data frame.
