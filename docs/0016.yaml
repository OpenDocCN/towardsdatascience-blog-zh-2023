- en: Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models
    to achieve better results. It is only in recent years, with the increasing computing
    speed, that ensemble learning became one of the most effective techniques for
    tackling difficult problems in the machine learning domain. This approach is used
    in most of the winning solutions for machine learning competitions, with prizes
    up to 100,000 dollars.

    powerful model? In this article, we’ll explore how to choose models to ensemble
    and how to aggregate them.

- en: Ensemble learning is based on the concept of combining multiple models, called
    *weak learners*. The name comes from the idea that individual ensemble members
    don’t need to be very accurate. As long as they are a little bit better than a
    random model, combining them is beneficial. Diversity is an important concept
    in ensemble learning, and refers to the idea that the individual models prediction
    in an ensemble should be **as different from each other as possible.** This is
    because different models are likely to make different types of errors. By…
