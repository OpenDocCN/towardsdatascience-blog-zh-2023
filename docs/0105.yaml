- en: Now that you have trained and performed hyperparameter tuning with machine learning
    models, it is now time to get the best model to be put under production. The batch
    inference is a deployment strategy in which a machine learning model is deployed
    in real-time and it only accepts **batches of data** on a periodic basis. As a
    result of this strategy, the models would mostly be able to work offline or on
    periodic tasks, such as generating reports or predictions.

  zh: 现在你已经训练并进行了机器学习模型的超参数调整，是时候将最佳模型投入生产。批量推理是一种部署策略，其中机器学习模型以实时方式部署，只接受**数据批次**。采用这种策略，模型通常能够离线工作或处理周期性任务，例如生成报告或预测。
- en: Batch inference can be useful in scenarios where we would want to classify the
    **sentiment** of customers towards various products. In other words, they might
    be giving their reviews and if we want to know the overall sentiment that customers
    have towards the product, batch inference can be a great strategy to deploy machine
    learning models.

  zh: 实时推理
- en: This is a type of deployment in which machine learning models are run on **incoming
    data** in real-time. Therefore, they would be ready to receive the data in a format
    and give real-time predictions so that actions could be taken accordingly. In
    addition to this, there would be requirements for real-time inference such as
    having a low latency system or higher predictive accuracy depending on the project
    and goals of the team.

  zh: 这是一种将机器学习模型在**接收数据**时进行实时运行的部署方式。因此，它们会准备好以某种格式接收数据并提供实时预测，以便可以采取相应的行动。此外，根据项目和团队目标，可能还需要满足实时推理的要求，如低延迟系统或更高的预测准确性。
- en: One of the classical examples of real-time inference would be in detecting the
    chances of **fraudulent** activity when making transactions. The machine learning
    model would be initially trained with data containing fraudulent and non-fraudulent
    transactions. After the best model is selected, it is deployed with real-time
    inference so that customers can get to know if there was fraudulent activity taking
    place.

    measures and compliance with the data before the product is deployed in real-time.
    In such scenarios, there is a higher importance given to data and ML code that
    is put into production.

    or servers** within an organization’s facility. As a result, it can offer high
    security and control over the data and the models.

  zh: 本地部署涉及在组织设施内的**物理设备或服务器**上部署机器学习模型。因此，它可以提供对数据和模型的高安全性和控制。
- en: On-premises deployment can be useful in predictive maintenance in which ML models
    are used to determine the possibility of failure of various manufacturing equipment.
    Rather than relying on the internet to give real-time predictions, we are using
    our own set of **servers** and machines that are capable of providing the computing
    needed for machine learning predictions. Whenever the model predicts that there
    are various defects in manufacturing materials, humans can take action by replacing
    those products.

  zh: 本地部署在预测性维护中可能非常有用，其中使用机器学习模型来确定各种制造设备的故障可能性。我们不依赖互联网提供实时预测，而是使用我们自己的一组**服务器**和机器，这些设备能够提供机器学习预测所需的计算能力。每当模型预测制造材料存在各种缺陷时，人们可以通过更换这些产品来采取行动。

    to the cloud. Therefore, we are using the compute resources and memory that are
    useful with the help of a **cluster** of devices. As a result, we should be able
    to scale our applications depending on the traffic faced by various ML operations
    done by users.

  zh: 这是一种将我们的机器学习服务提供到云中的部署方式。因此，我们利用**集群**设备的计算资源和内存。因此，我们应能根据用户执行的各种机器学习操作的流量来扩展我们的应用程序。
- en: Some of the examples where cloud deployment could be useful are when we are
    not certain about the number of resources we might be needed to train and deploy
    models. Furthermore, these services are initialized only when the users are going
    to be using our predictions.

  zh: 云部署在我们不确定训练和部署模型所需资源数量时可能会很有用。此外，这些服务仅在用户使用我们的预测时才会初始化。
- en: One of the popular examples of using cloud deployment would be in predicting
    the chances of a customer having a chance to churn on a particular set of services.
    If we have built a service that customers who have a subscription, we would be
    predicting the chances of whether a customer is going to leave the service based
    on a set of predictive features. Since we are not fully aware of the total number
    of customers who can enroll in the service and at the same time leave the service,
    it is a good approach to deploy training models in the **cloud** as this would
    result in easier scalability as and when needed depending on the traffic.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 使用云部署的一个流行示例是预测客户在特定服务集上流失的可能性。如果我们建立了一个服务，让订阅者使用，我们将基于一组预测特征预测客户是否会离开服务。由于我们无法完全了解可能注册服务和同时离开服务的客户总数，因此在**云**中部署训练模型是一种好的方法，因为这会根据流量需求简化扩展。

- en: Since we are deploying the models in **resource-constrained** environments which
    is unlike the ones that are deployed in the servers, hardware considerations must
    be placed before ending up with an ML product. Machine learning applications could
    be quite useful and can have reasonable accuracy. If the model, however, is not
    able to generate predictions when there are less number of hardware resources,
    it would not be the most appropriate one to be used for mobile applications.

    deployment and consider the feasibility of models to be run in the cloud. This
    can involve reducing the **complexity** or size of the ML model that must be used
    in edge devices. Therefore, the type of deployment would depend on the type of
