- en: Another way of representing the probabilities associated with a random variable
    is to map the cumulative probabilities. A cumulative probability for a random
    variable X at value x is the probability that X takes a value less than or equal
    to x. Typically we use the uppercase F to represent a cumulative probability.
    Therefore F(x = a ) = Pr(X ≤ a). This function is called the cumulative distribution
    function (CDF). The advantage of a CDF is that it has the same definition irrespective
    of whether the variable is discrete or continuous. For the examples above, we
    can construct the CDF by just adding up the PDF.

    or Tails on a coin, Number on the face of a die, etc.) only. But in real life,
    variables can have infinitely many values. Let us take the case of a person arriving

    second, then it will be 1 in 3600\. If we measure in milliseconds, then 1 in 3.6
    million and so forth. As you can see, the exact moment of arrival can be split
    into further smaller segments. It can take infinitely many values. Therefore the
    probability of him arriving at a given point in time is zero.

    the next message is a continuous variable and can take fractional values as well
    (2.3 minutes, 4.8 hours, etc.). The difference can be illustrated in the figure
