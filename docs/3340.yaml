    in order to progress in your data science career are varied and increasingly interdisciplinary.
    Unlike, say, stats or programming, these are also areas where structured educational
    environments, like degree programs or bootcamps, can only get you so far.

    and personal backgrounds, and have learned a great deal about what works—and what
    doesn’t—in real-world situations across a wide range of organizations. For our
    highlights this week, we’ve brought together a strong lineup of articles that
    focus on these less technical, but still crucial, aspects of data science work:
    they offer valuable insights based on these professionals’ lived experience.'
