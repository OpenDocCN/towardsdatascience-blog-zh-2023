- en: I joined the Google Brain team in 2015 right as [TensorFlow was open sourced](https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/11/tensorflow-googles-latest-machine.html).
    Contrary to popular belief, TensorFlow was **not** the secret sauce behind Google’s
    success at that point in time. Only a handful of researchers had used it, and
    it took several years before it transformed Alphabet’s most important properties
    in a material way.
  prefs: []

- en: However, TensorFlow’s impact on the open source community was almost immediate.
    It ushered in an era of community-driven innovation that has directly contributed
    to the breakneck pace of AI advancements in the last couple of years. To be fair,
    TensorFlow was not the first open source deep learning library (e.g. [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
    was released in 2014), but it was the first that was backed by the level of credibility
    (and developer advocacy budget) of a company like Google.
  prefs: []

    own data to actually train predictive **models**. In order to predict future housing
    prices, you need a dataset with historic housing prices and use TensorFlow to
    train a model. The model that comes out on the other end now encodes the aggregate
    knowledge of your data. A few years after open sourcing TensorFlow, Google took
    another fateful step that accelerated the path towards “free for all” AI. The
    decision to [open source the BERT model](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html)
    in 2018 helped trigger an avalanche in large language models. Shortly thereafter
    in 2019, OpenAI (still a non-profit at that point in time) [open sourced their
    GPT2 model](https://openai.com/research/gpt-2-1-5b-release). And just like that,
    open sourcing trained models became a thing.

    model like BERT shouldn’t be underestimated. TensorFlow is simply a set of instructions,
    BERT is the result of a costly training process of applying those instructions
    to a large amount of data. To use a powerful analogy: If TensorFlow was a biology
    textbook on human reproduction, BERT would be a college graduate. Someone read
    the textbook, applied its instructions, and spent a lot of time and money to raise
    an offspring who is now a fully educated adult ready to enter the workforce (or
    grad school).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How did we end up there? I attribute many of the open sourcing decisions during
    that period to the growing ​​prominence and relative bargaining power of research
    scientists. Researchers prefer jobs that allow them to publish in prestigious
    journals (like [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/)), and those publications are more relevant
    (and credible) if they come with [open sourced code](https://paperswithcode.com/).
    That’s one of the reasons why more secretive companies like Apple [find it hard
    to attract talent](https://hbr.org/2015/11/can-apple-attract-top-researchers-if-it-keeps-their-research-secret).
    Researchers who are allowed to talk publicly about their work are widely recognized
    in the industry, and their market value becomes directly correlated with their
    publications in top tier journals. Since rockstar AI researchers are scarce, [they
    command annual compensation packages north of $1M](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-salaries-openai.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not a lot of economic scrutiny was applied to these open sourcing decisions,
    let alone the more important aspect of licensing (more on that later). What was
    the value of the IP Google gave up with BERT? How would Google’s competitors use
    these libraries and models against them? Thankfully, open source infrastructure
    projects and their corporate maintainers provide an informative case study on
    companies wisening up to the implications of open source licensing decisions.

    open source AI, enterprise software went through an open source licensing crisis.
    Mostly [thanks to AWS](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html),
    which had mastered the craft of taking open source infrastructure projects and
    building commercial services around them, many open source projects exchanged
    their permissible licenses for “Copyleft” or “ShareAlike” (SA) alternatives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not all open source is created equal. Permissible licenses (like Apache 2.0
    or MIT) allow anyone to take an open source project and build a commercial service
    around it. “Copyleft” licenses (like GPL), similar to Creative Common’s “ShareAlike”
    terms, are one way to protect against this. They are sometimes referred to as
    a “poison pill”, because they require any derivative product to be licensed the
    same way. If AWS launched a service based on an open source project with a “Copyleft”
    license, the AWS service itself must be open sourced under the same license.

    and maintainers of open source projects like [MongoDB](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/)
    and [Redis](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/redis-labs-changes-its-open-source-license-again/)
    switched up their licenses to less permissible alternatives. This led to a painful
    but entertaining back-and-forth between [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/setting-the-record-straight-aws-open-source/)
    and [those companies](https://redis.com/blog/aws-vs-open-source/) on the principles
    and merits of open source, which has since calmed down a bit.

    the commercial benefits than themselves, shouldn’t the same be happening with
    AI? Isn’t this an even bigger deal for open source AI models, which hold the aggregate

    the data is pointing in a different direction. Large corporations like Microsoft
    are [changing licensing](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base/commit/4dcbeabd3db1a13c8aeead201bb7a4811904f1fd)
    of some of their most popular models from permissible to non-commercial (NC) licenses,
    and Meta has started to use non-commercial licenses for all of their recent open
    source projects ([MMS](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/multilingual-model-speech-recognition/),
    [ImageBind](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/imagebind-six-modalities-binding-ai/),
    [DINOv2](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dino-v2-computer-vision-self-supervised-learning/)
    are all CC-BY-NC 4.0 and [LLAMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)
    is GPL 3.0). Even popular projects from universities like [Stanford’s Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)
    are only licensed for non-commercial use (inherited by the non-permissible attributes
    of the dataset they used). Entire companies change their business models in order
    to protect their IP and rid themselves of the obligation to open source as part
    of their mission — remember when a small non-profit called OpenAI [transformed
    itself](https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp) into a capped-profit? Notice that GPT2
    was open sourced, but GPT3.5 or GPT4 were not?

    although opaque, is noticeable. Below is an analysis of model licenses on [Hugging
    Face](https://huggingface.co/models). The share of permissible licenses (like
    Apache, MIT, or BSD) has been on a persistent decline since mid 2022, while non-permissible
    licenses (like GPL) or restrictive licenses (like OpenRAIL) are becoming more
    common.

    (LLaMA was open sourced by Meta with a non-commercial license) dominates all other
    open source efforts. The bigger problem is that these derivative models are not
    as forthcoming about their licenses. Almost none declare their license explicitly,
    and you have to do your own research to find out that the models and data they
    are based on don’t allow for commercial use.

    hard-earned intellectual property that companies develop over years, spending

    generation of large generative models) will look similar to other innovations
    that require significant capital investment and accumulation of specialized talent,
    like cloud computing platforms or operating systems. A few major players will
    emerge that provide the AI foundation to the rest of the ecosystem. There will
    still be ample room for a layer of startups on top of that foundation, but just
    as there are no open source projects dethroning AWS, I consider it very unlikely
    that the open source community will produce a serious competitor to OpenAI’s GPT
    and whatever comes next.
