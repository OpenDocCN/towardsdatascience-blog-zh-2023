- en: Getting started with Deep Learning is easy. You can have a neural network setup
    and training within just a few lines of code. But it can become overwhelming when
    you go from a beginner to an intermediate level. You are confronted with many
    new terms like “EfficientNet” or “DeBERTa”. What are all these terms? What do
    they have to do with neural networks?

- en: The beginner tutorials don’t tell you that only a few people train neural networks
    from scratch in practice. This is because neural networks take a lot of time and
    computational resources to train on a sufficiently large dataset to perform well.
    Hence, re-using a pre-trained model as a starting point is a common practice.
    This practice is called Transfer Learning [2].
