    of it is the thrill of discovering a new voice sharing their unique experiences
    and knowledge. Another is realizing, time and time again, that there’s always
    a fresh angle to explore, even when we deal with common questions and challenges.

    newest cohort of writers, and we’re doing it for a couple of reasons. First, we
    wanted to celebrate their ability to communicate complex ideas with clarity, precision,
    and a distinct personal perspective.

- en: Second—and perhaps more selfishly—we’re highlighting these articles in the hope
    that other members of our community feel similarly inspired to [share their expertise
    with TDS’s audience](https://bit.ly/write-for-tds). We cover a very wide range
    of topics—from AI ethics and climate-change data to ML pipelines and product management.
    All that *really* matters is that you care deeply about your subject matter and
    think others should care about it, too.

    was curious to see [**how well ChatGPT might perform on sentiment-analysis tasks**](/can-chatgpt-compete-with-domain-specific-sentiment-analysis-machine-learning-models-cdcd9937b460),
    so he set out to test the chatbot’s abilities against those of domain-specific
