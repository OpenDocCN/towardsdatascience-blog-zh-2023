    software development team. From the roles and responsibilities of team members
    to the tools and processes used, data science teams require a unique approach
    to ensure they are set up for success. We'll explore some things to consider when
    building a data science team, including the importance of cross-functional collaboration,
    specialized skills, and experimentation and iteration in the data science process.
    And We'll have uncovered some valuable insights and best practices to help you
    navigate the complexities of building a data science team if we've convinced ourselves
    by the end.

- en: In data science, the problems rarely revolve around a specific technology or
    programming language and, more often, around the data itself. Consequently, the
    makeup of a data science team can look quite different from a traditional software
    team. A diverse set of skills and perspectives is a boon in working with data.
    That's why interdisciplinary teams, with a mix of experts of varying backgrounds
    and domain-specific areas, are often successful. In addition, a group of generalists
    — who can approach problems with a fresh perspective — can bring valuable insights
    and help drive innovation.

- en: In their analytics pursuits and design of data products, data science teams
    also often have a more exploratory, iterative approach to problem-solving. As
    a result, data products and analytics projects are often characterized by uncertainty
    and a need for clear-cut solutions. Data scientists must constantly sift through
    large amounts of data to identify patterns and insights, and they may need to
    try multiple different approaches before arriving at a final solution. This iterative
    process can be time-consuming and make it difficult for scientists or leaders
    to predict precisely when a team will complete some projects. As a result, data
    science teams may require more flexibility and autonomy than traditional software
    teams.

    topologies: they are built on experimentation and exploration. Unlike some software
    teams, which may have a clear set of requirements and a defined roadmap, data
    scientists are often tasked with uncovering insights and identifying new opportunities
    within vast amounts of data. This model requires a different approach to teamwork,
    emphasizing flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to try new things.'

- en: In a high-functioning data science team, individual contributors and leadership
    should be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. They should be able to pivot
    quickly when an experiment doesn't yield the desired results and willing to take
    risks and try new approaches. In contrast to traditional feature development teams,
    whose goals may include delivering a specific product on a particular schedule,
    data science teams focus on uncovering insights and making discoveries work on
    unpredictable time horizons. A vital aspect of a successful data science team
    is the ability to work in an iterative and exploratory manner, with a willingness
    to experiment and try new things while continuously looking for new opportunities
    and insights within the data.

- en: Data science teams often differ from typical software teams in their topologies
    because they require a deep understanding of the domain in which they operate.
    This expertise is critical to building impactful data products that genuinely
    solve problems and deliver value to the end user. With domain expertise, data
    scientists can avoid falling into the trap of optimizing for vanity metrics or
    building models that perpetuate bias in the data.

    not just the technical aspects of the problem but also the building products with
    business context, user needs, and ethical implications in mind. Using a holistic
    approach, data science teams can align their work with the organization's overall
    goals and optimize the desired outcomes. This approach not only helps to mitigate
    bias in data products but reduces tunnel vision in optimizing experiment outcomes
    or model performance in favor of long-term business objectives or user behavior.

- en: To drive more significant impact and create value through data products, data
    science teams (especially those developing user-facing data products) should be
    "stream-aligned" and accountable for their work's ultimate outcomes or user impact.
    These teams have a deep understanding of the problem space and the desired outcomes,
    are closely connected to the end user and are accountable for the impact and performance
    of their products. Furthermore, in collaboration with supporting teams and product
    stakeholders, they are responsible for ensuring their data products evolve to
    meet the shifting needs of the end users. By taking a holistic approach to data
    science and focusing on outcomes (rather than simply delivering data or models),
    data science teams can respond to user needs, develop a stronger sense of purpose,
    and create products that are adaptive to changing marketplaces and evolving user
    needs.

    needed for DataOps or MLOps impact data science organizations. While classic DevOps
    teams focus on the infrastructure and operations required to deploy and maintain
    software, DataOps, and MLOps teams must also consider the unique needs of managing
    and deploying machine learning models. This nuance often emphasizes collaboration
    between data scientists, engineers, and operations professionals to ensure that
    models are deployed and continuously monitored, tested, and updated to meet the
    (evolving) needs of the user. Operations supporting production data products also
    require understanding the problem domain to ensure the products deployed are operating
    with the right level of accuracy and fairness while still addressing the business
    problems they intend to solve.

- en: Creating a new data product involves not just data scientists but stakeholders
    from other parts of the organization. Such collaboration means that the communication
    architecture for data science teams must be designed to accommodate these different
    stakeholders and their different perspectives. This can be quite different from
    the communication architecture of some software teams, where the focus may be
    on communication within the development team. Data scientists must also be able
    to communicate the results of their work to non-technical stakeholders, such as
    business leaders, and help them understand the implications of the developed data
    products. Requiring data scientists to have a deep understanding of the problem
    space and strong communication skills ultimately impacts how to embed data scientists
    or teams within the organization.

- en: One example is when a team delivers a data science function as a service. For
    example, a platform for experimentation or a model used by multiple downstream
    products may require a similar structure and approach to a typical software development
    team. In such cases, the team may focus on building and maintaining the infrastructure,
    tooling, and processes to support the experimentation and model development process.
    They may also be responsible for ensuring the quality and performance of the models,
    as well as providing documentation and support to other teams using the platform
    or models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, while the structure and approach to development or sustaining may be
    similar in such cases, the required skill sets may differ. Data science teams
    delivering a function-as-a-service will still need a deep understanding of the
    specific domain, often complemented with strong collaboration and communication
    skills to effectively work with downstream teams and stakeholders. Supporting
    data products as-a-service requires providing guidance and support to ensure that
    the developed data products align with the desired outcomes, lest metrics or models
    be misinterpreted or misused.

- en: What have we learned? In data science, the product's architecture (such as an
    ML model) is often only fully understood once the data scientists have had a chance
    to experiment and explore. Consequently, data science team structures need to
    be flexible and adaptable, able to pivot as the team’s understanding of the problem
    and potential solutions evolves. Furthermore, it means that the communication
    architecture within and between the data science team and the rest of the organization
    needs to reflect this adaptability and handle a higher degree of uncertainty.
    This outsized focus on collaboration, exploration, and end-to-end ownership characterizes
    the topology of high-impact data science functions.
