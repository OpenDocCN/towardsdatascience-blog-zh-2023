    AI, how data professionals can provide long-term value to organizations they are
    part of is evolving. Real value is going to come from not just being the most
    technically competent person in the room but being able to shape how this impacts
    product and business outcomes. This includes being able to guide your organization
    towards the right data strategy and shaping how data products tie seamlessly into
    product experiences. The analysis in this article around the the transformation
    at StackOverflow serves as a compelling case study towards that goal.

    by software developers for programming support, has been through a rough ride
    lately. If you haven’t used StackOverflow before, it’s a Quora / Reddit-like Q&A
    forum where you can ask programming-related questions. It’s been several years
    since I wrote production-quality code but back when I did, StackOverflow was incredible.
    For example, if you ran into the most obscure of errors while compiling your code
    and got an error message you could not make sense of, you would stick it into
    Google search. More often that not, you would find a StackOverflow page where
    someone had asked the same question and got an answer. Less often, you would find
    another soul who had the exact same obscure problem as you but got no answer —
    in which case, good luck. More precisely, [69% of questions](https://devclass.com/2023/05/15/stack-overflow-traffic-drops-as-developers-turn-to-ai-coding-assistants/)
    on StackOverflow are answered, which is pretty impressive.'

    data shows that their traffic [dropped 14%](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/stack-overflow-chatgpt/)
    year over year (StackOverflow says it’s [closer to 5%](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/08/08/insights-into-stack-overflows-traffic/)).
    Nevertheless, the trend is downward and is explained primarily by the emergence
    of AI coding products like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These products have meaningful
    code-writing capabilities and are therefore able to provide programming support,
    at least partly as good as StackOverflow does. Ironically, several of the large
    language models (LLMs) behind these AI products were trained using scraped StackOverflow
    data.

- en: There are several AI [code writing and editing tools](https://beebom.com/best-ai-coding-tools/)
    available in the market today. These are either independent products (like OpenAI
    Codex, ChatGPT, Google Bard) or products that are natively integrated inside existing
    platforms (like GitHub Copilot, Replit Ghostwriter, Amazon CodeWhisperer). They
    have a broad range of capabilities including code generation, code editing, autocomplete
    and debugging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The products that have native distribution (like GitHub Copilot) are at a large
    advantage because they can operate seamlessly within environments that programmers
    already use today, and we will see more products attempting to get plugged into
    existing environments. For example, CodeGPT has a plugin that lets developers
    use the product from [within Visual Studio Code](https://beebom.com/how-install-use-codegpt-vs-code/)
    (a popular code editing tool).

    [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/11hmsqp/github_copilot_whats_your_experience_been_like/)
    captures feedback from several web developers about GitHub Copilot — the overarching
    theme is that the product is useful in a subset of situations where developers
    have to write net new code and don’t want to spend time writing from the scratch.
    Even for those situations, it’s often hit or miss.

    take in a ton of data and generate output on the basis of this construct: in a
    particular context, for the question you asked, what is the most likely word /
    text to follow the previous word**. It’s essentially calculating the probability
    of a word following another, and generating output based on that. Despite this
    construct, given the amount of data that’s gone into training these models, the
    results for the more general ChatGPT use cases (like drafting an email or summarizing
    a page) have been nothing short of impressive. But it’s important to remember
    that language models, by design, have limited analytical / math capabilities.
    In other words, when you ask the model “what is 2+2”, it may give you the right
    answer — not because it knows math but because it has seen that text pattern before
    in its training data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, when it comes to code generation, the **model does not really “know”
    the underlying concepts behind programming** but is predicting results based on
    its training with a ton of text data. The consequence of this is the GitHub Copilot
    feedback above — it is sometimes good at generating the base code you need, but
    **its ability to actually understand code, debug and provide you explanations
    is limited**. This will get better over time but it’s hard to say if it will ever
    get to the point of high accuracy / high reliability.
