    is gaining more importance each day. Almost every service provider or platform
    on the planet is trying to reach people (and potential customers) by understanding
    their behavioural patterns, engagement etc. And geofencing technology has created
    a new wave in this domain. It allows organizations to send messages or alerts
    to users who enter or exit a specific geographic area.

    governments, and individuals, and it is changing the world around us in many ways.
    With a simple implementation process and potential to reach almost every electronic
    device in the world, lets look at how geofencing is shaping the world around you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Geofencing works on the principle of spatial relationships. The service is deployed
    on apps or software that collects location data through GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi or cellular
    data. It tracks, at any given point of time, if a mobile device or RFID tag’s
    location lies within a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location.
    This virtual boundary is called as Geofence (owing to its similarities to a fence
    around a real estate property). As soon as there’s a trigger of any device entering
    or leaving a geofence, the service runs pre-programmed actions ranging from sending
    coupons, notification, text messages, security alerts to the device and enabling
    certain engagement features for targeted advertising etc.
