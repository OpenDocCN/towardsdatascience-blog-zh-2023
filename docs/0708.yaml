    to ensure that their employees are appropriately compensated for their contributions
    to the organisation. In addition, by demonstrating their value through the assessment

    to write a compelling self-evaluation. Realising that it is a recurring question,
    particularly among early-career IT professionals, I put together this quick guide
    with my thoughts on the subject. So here is what Software Engineers, Data Scientists
    and Application Developers need to know about writing a thorough and impactful
    self-assessment that demonstrates their strong performance while also touching
    on areas for growth to ensure a well-rounded and balanced evaluation.
