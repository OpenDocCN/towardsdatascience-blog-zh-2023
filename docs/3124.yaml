- en: As far as programming languages and their paradigms go, Julia’s take is incredibly
    unique. Comparing Julia to the slough of other multi-paradigm programming languages
    that are popular today, Julia is radically different by many comparisons. This
    is especially the case in paradigm, or how the types of the language (which hold
    the data,) work with functions or methods in the language. There are a number
    of different solutions that have been proposed for this, and every language tends
    to sit in one category — though not necessarily firmly. Most modern languages
    have bridged multiple programming concepts through these paradigms, and this makes
    most modern programming languages multi-paradigm. Under this umbrella, the Julia
    language would also be included.

    paradigm centered around multiple dispatch. This is not to say this paradigm is
    entirely novel, the basis of this paradigm is found in the Standard Meta Language
    (SML). I actually, because of Julia, went back and tried that language ages ago
    — it was a very interesting experience, and if you would like to read more about
    what transpired with that here is a link to that article:'
