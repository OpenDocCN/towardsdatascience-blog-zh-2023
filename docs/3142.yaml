    real pain points when it comes to writing: finding the right words, improving
    style, getting inspiration. Those who have tried them can attest how tempting

    to mitigate the risk of exposing Generative models to AI-generated content? One
    possible approach is to attempt to counter the trend by encouraging content creation
    without AI tools. Another approach involves developing methods to detect AI-generated
    data and filtering it out during the model training process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea of the first approach is to find ways to incentivize creators to use
    generative models less frequently or in fewer contexts. However, the feasibility
    of this approach may be limited. Even if we could find such incentives (e.g. a
    reward or a sanction), the challenge lies in verifying whether a piece of content
    is genuinely human-generated or not. This leads us to the second approach, which
    also relies on the ability to distinguish human-generated from AI-generated data.

    hidden signals in the data that are invisible to humans but detectable by algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    if Generative AI providers add it to their products. This is not the case today,
    and it might be too optimistic to expect that any time soon.

    Andrew Ng is not optimistic about the adoption of watermarking. He explains how,
    in the current GenAI race, watermarking appears like a competitive disadvantage
    for AI companies.

    its scalability: it is not model-agnostic (it detects whether a content was generated
    by a specific LLM, not by any given LLM) and requires to have access to the model’s
    log probabilities.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve learned about the importance of training generative models on human-generated
    data to avoid the decline of their performance. This poses a significant challenge,
    particularly as the Internet is their primary source of training data, and as
    more an more content online is AI-generated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    human content creation, and preventing models from being trained on synthetic
    data. However both solutions raise complex, open-ended questions. How can we incentivize
    online content creators to rely less on AI? How can we establish reliable, scalable
    methods for detecting AI-generated content?'
