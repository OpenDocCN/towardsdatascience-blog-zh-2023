- en: Just over a week ago I was watching an NBA game between the Milwaukee Bucks
    and the Boston Celtics. This was a match-up between the top 2 teams in the league,
    which many considered to be a prequel to the Eastern Conference finals. Being
    a big basketball and NBA fan myself, the game turned out rather disappointing
    as the Milwaukee Bucks lost to the Boston Celtics 140–99, a rare blow-out defeat
    for Milwaukee which holds the best (regular season) record in the 2022–2023 season.

    loss at home, the commentator of the game alerted me to the fact that they were
    actually playing a back-to-back game, which is a game played right after playing
    on the previous day (in this instance, a game away at Indiana on the previous
    day). In other words, fatigue may have played a role in their loss as playing
    back-to-back games is physically demanding for athletes, which may have been exacerbated
    by the travelling between games (from Indiana back to Milwaukee).
