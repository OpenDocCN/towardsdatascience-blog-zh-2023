    extensively for various analytic tasks. I’ve described one of the possible use
    cases in [this article](https://data-mozart.com/island-adventures-with-t-sql-window-functions/),
    but there are literally dozen of scenarios that can be quickly and intuitively
    solved by using window functions.

    disappointed) that there is no DAX equivalent to SQL window functions. Ok, we
    could have solved these challenges of performing different calculations over a
    certain set of rows, by writing more complex DAX — but, honestly, that was very
    often a really painful experience.

    a brand new set of DAX functions — collectively called window functions — that
    should achieve the same goal as SQL window functions. At this moment, there are
    three DAX window functions: ***OFFSET***, ***INDEX***, and ***WINDOW***.'
