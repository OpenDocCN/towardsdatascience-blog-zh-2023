- en: 'Today, we will delve into three crucial concepts in Machine Learning: Linear
    Regression, Cost Function, and Gradient Descent. These concepts form the foundation
    of many machine learning algorithms. Initially, I decided against writing an article
    on these topics because they are so widely covered. However, I have changed my
    mind because understanding these concepts is essential for understanding more
    advanced topics like Neural Networks (that I plan on tackling in the near future).
    In addition, this series will be divided into two parts to make it more manageable
    and organized for better understanding.'

    to answer. In this case, our friend Mark is considering selling his 2400 feet²
    house and has come to us for assistance in determining the most appropriate price
    to list it at.

    After a little digging, we find a list of three nearby houses and see how much
    they sold for. Of course, a typical…
