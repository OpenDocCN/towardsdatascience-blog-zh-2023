- en: Prior to founding Data-Centric Solutions, I spearheaded the development, execution,
    and implementation of the AI strategy at an established bank. Although relatively
    green in delivering at such scale, I accepted the job with enthusiasm. Dispelling
    the initial feelings of imposter syndrome, I reassured myself that the worst-case
    scenario would involve making a few mistakes, learning lessons, and professional
    growth.

- en: It became abundantly clear that AI strategy was significantly more intricate
    than I had initially perceived. Throughout my career, I have had the good fortune
    of being involved with both successful and unsuccessful strategies. I want to
    share some of the valuable insights I gained, and hope this can serve as a foundation
    for others to build on.

- en: I initially discovered [Wardley maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec)
    via recommendation from a trusted mentor. For those unfamiliar, Wardley maps are
    an approach to system mapping. As the name suggests, the method was developed
    by Simon Wardley.
