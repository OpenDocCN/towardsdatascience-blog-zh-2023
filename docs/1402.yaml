- en: Headspace is the amount of room between the top of the coffee bed and the shower
    screen during an espresso shot. It is one of the variables of the puck that interact
    with grind size, dose, and tamp pressure. More specifically, headspace is the
    amount of room a puck has to expand during a shot, and this can impact how water
    and gas flow through coffee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge in optimizing for headspace is that it is convoluted with grind,
    dose, and tamp. I have generally found less headspace to be optimal, but I wanted
    a better experiment to isolate variables.

- en: I decided to add spent coffee on top of the fresh coffee which would act similarly
    to coffee in terms of expansion and water flow, but it would not interfere with
    extraction.

- en: I did this testing using salami shots on the Decent Espresso machine. A salami
    shot can be used to measure extraction as well as better understand when different
    taste components are extracted into the cup.

- en: I also used coffee that was 3 months post-roast, which has been my experimental
    coffee for some recent tests. The aim is to have coffee that has been degassed,
    and I can focus only on TDS and EY in terms of data metrics in a more ideal setting.

    is measured using a refractometer, and this number combined with the output weight
    of the shot and the input weight of the coffee is used to determine the percentage
    of coffee extracted into the cup, called **Extraction Yield (EY)**.'

- en: The first test set I used was on the Blooming Ramp profile, which ramps until
    it hits a certain pressure (4 bars), blooms for 30 seconds, and then infuses at
    2.2 ml/s. However, this profile didn’t work well for a larger headspace because
    by the time the pressure built up, the target output was already reached.

    3g of spent coffee) because the baseline didn’t have a bloom phase.

- en: I redid the experiment using a flat 2 ml/s profile. This controlled for the
    bloom phase, and it allows us to focus only on headpsace. This showed that pressure
    built up better with a smaller headspace.

- en: Headspace is a variable that is easy to change and doesn’t require any special
    tools. I hope this small study inspires people to try less headspace because the
    data points towards less headspace as the optimal parameter choice.
