    Some people have speculated that these models are pulling from a preformulated
    database of responses, and some have gone as far to speculate that these LLMs
    have gained a human-level of sentience. These are extreme stances, and as you
    might guess, both are incorrect.

    they use probability to determine the next word that should come in a sentence**.
    This understanding is technically correct, but it’s a little too high level to
    sufficiently understand these models. In order to build a stronger intuition,
