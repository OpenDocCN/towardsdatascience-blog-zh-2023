- en: We both work in a field that values technical skills and productivity, so it's
    okay if you don't see non-technical activities such as personal branding and industrial
    visibility as top priorities. But by the end of this article, you, as an AI practitioner,
    will understand what industry visibility is, its benefits, and how to build and
    improve your own visibility in the AI field.

- en: Industry visibility and personal brand are two terms that go hand in hand, and
    in some cases, they are used interchangeably. You may be a mid, senior or experienced
    AI practitioner and have seen it all (from a technical perspective). You've probably
    worked within different teams with various structural configurations of Data Engineers,
    Scientists, and Product Managers. You understand the critical processes in a machine
    learning pipeline, including productionising AI models.
