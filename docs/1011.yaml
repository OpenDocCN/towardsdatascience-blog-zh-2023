- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced incredibly fast in recent years, giving
    rise to powerful tools known as generative AI and large language models. Generative
    AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images,
    or music, based on patterns learned from existing data. Large language models,
    like OpenAI’s GPT series, are a subset of generative AI that have been specifically
    trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language.
    These models have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing them to produce
    coherent, contextually relevant, and even creative outputs.

    text that is indistinguishable from a human writer. This ability also brought
    up concerns regarding academic dishonesty. Consequently, I authored an article
    on Medium [anticipating the emergence of AI-assisted academic misconduct](/anticipating-the-emergence-of-ai-assisted-academic-misconduct-cf05f70a592c).

    how they can complement my interest in traditional AI systems. Recently, my colleagues
    and I evaluated ChatGPT’s capacity to pass a simulated Masters-level social work
    licensing exam — and it did. Our study’s pre-print is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369181098_Time_to_Move_Beyond_the_ASWB_Licensing_Exams_Can_Generative_Artificial_Intelligence_Offer_a_Way_Forward_for_Social_Work)
    and will soon be published in [Research on Social Work Practice](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rsw).
    ChatGPT now accomplishes various complex tasks at lightning speeds I never imagined
    possible just a year ago.

    can impact your educational experience. AI can revolutionize how you learn, research,
    and engage with the complex challenges of social work. Large language models can
    do much more than generate or re-write text. You can use these models to summarize
    lengthy policy documents, analyze quantitative and qualitative data, generate
    insights for program evaluation, automate routine functions in a community organization,
    create marketing materials, build web applications and websites — and many more.

- en: One promising application of large language models in the field of social work
    lies within mental health services. Virtual therapy assistants, powered by AI,
    can offer support and guidance to clients between therapy sessions or when a social
    worker is not immediately available. For example, virtual assistants could help
    clients practice coping strategies, provide psychoeducation, or offer brief stress-reduction
    interventions. These would be assistants that could support various tasks but
    would not replace social workers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    clients’ language patterns. By analyzing text-based communication or transcriptions
    of therapy sessions, AI can identify patterns, themes, and sentiments that may
    provide valuable insights into a client’s emotional state, challenges, and progress
    in therapy. For instance, AI could help detect signs of depression, anxiety, or
    other mental health issues by analyzing a client’s word choices, tone, or expression
    of emotions.

    process. Social workers can benefit from tools that help manage extensive paperwork
    demands, such as writing case notes, treatment plans, and progress reports, which
    can be time-consuming and detract from the time spent with clients. By leveraging
    AI, social workers can reduce the time and effort spent on administrative tasks,
    allowing them to focus more on direct client care and improving the overall quality
    of mental health services.

    administration within social work organizations. Managing and coordinating social
    work programs involve a lot of writing-intensive tasks, such as drafting reports,
    creating and updating training materials, and communicating with stakeholders.
    AI-powered tools can help generate text using raw data and existing templates
    as a starting point for these tasks. By automating the initial drafting process,
    social workers can save time and focus on refining and tailoring content to ensure
    it accurately reflects the program’s impact and outcomes.

    of program results to stakeholders, funders, and policymakers. Large language
    models can also assist in developing and updating training materials for social
    work programs. By analyzing existing content and incorporating new research or
    best practices, AI can suggest revisions and additions to training materials that
    ensure they remain up-to-date and effective.

    a crucial aspect of the social work profession that involves reviewing, critiquing,
    and developing policies to address social issues. Policy analysis often requires
    social workers to navigate complex and lengthy policy documents, which can be
    time-consuming and challenging. Large language models can help social workers
    synthesize and evaluate policy documents more efficiently. By extracting critical
    information and summarizing the main points, AI-powered tools can enable social
    workers to quickly grasp the essentials of a policy without having to read through
    the entire document. This workflow can save time and allow social workers to focus
    on analyzing the policy’s implications, strengths, and weaknesses.
  prefs: []

    to identify gaps and opportunities in existing policies. By analyzing and comparing
    multiple policy documents, AI can recognize patterns, trends, and areas where
    policies may be lacking or inconsistent. AI can help social workers pinpoint areas
    that require further attention or new approaches to address unmet needs. In addition,
    large language models can assist social workers in generating policy recommendations
    based on the identified gaps and opportunities. By drawing on a vast knowledge
    base, AI can suggest evidence-based solutions and best practices for policy development.

    qualitative and quantitative data to determine a program’s success and identify
    improvement areas. Large language models can assist social workers in analyzing
    program data more efficiently and generating insights that may take time to be
    apparent. For example, AI-powered tools can help analyze qualitative data, such
    as interviews and focus groups, by identifying participants’ themes, patterns,
    and sentiments. Thus AI-powered tools can provide social workers with valuable
    information about the experiences and perspectives of clients and other stakeholders,
    which can inform program improvements.

    by identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies. By automating the initial
    stages of data analysis, social workers can focus on interpreting the results
    and applying their expertise to make data-driven decisions and recommendations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By leveraging the insights generated by AI-powered data analysis, social workers
    can assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their programs and identify areas

    culturally-sensitive messages that resonate with diverse audiences. By tailoring
    messages based on different community members’ preferences, language, and concerns,
    AI-powered tools can improve the effectiveness of outreach campaigns and help
    build stronger connections with community members. Additionally, AI can assist
    in identifying trends and emerging issues in online conversations and social media,
    allowing social workers to stay informed and responsive to the community’s needs
    and priorities.
  prefs: []

    in community organizing efforts. By automating the creation and updating of shared
    documents, tracking progress on tasks, and coordinating schedules, AI-powered
    tools can save time and improve the overall efficiency of organizing initiatives.
    Furthermore, social workers and community organizers can use AI to analyze data
    on community resources and needs, which enables them to identify gaps and opportunities
    for collaboration. This support, in turn, allows social workers to make informed
    decisions about resource allocation and partnerships to maximize the impact of
    their efforts.
