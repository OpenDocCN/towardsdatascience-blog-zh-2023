    models that can predict things, to computer vision that can identify objects,
    to most recently LLMs (large language models). For the sake of this discussion,
    we will focus on LLMs which have been in the spotlight recently after OpenAI opened

    are super early stage — [52% of the batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/meet-the-yc-winter-2023-batch)
    were accepted with only an idea and 77% of the batch had zero revenue before YC.

- en: 1\. Focus on specific problems and customers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Startups are targeting focused problems for a focused set of customers, i.e.
    there are fewer “generic” AI solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One such example is [Yuma.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IBB-yuma-chatgpt-for-customer-support),
    which focuses on assisting Shopify merchants who struggle with handling customer
    requests and concerns (you can see a demo [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IBB-yuma-chatgpt-for-customer-support)).
    By utilizing large language models (LLMs), Yuma.ai automates the generation of
    responses from a knowledge base. Another startup called [Speedy](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/I7a-speedy-democratizing-marketing-to-smbs)
    is dedicated to supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack
    the time to create marketing content using generative AI. [Haven](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven-2)
    aims to automate approximately 50% of resident interactions for property managers.
    [OfOne](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/I5F-ofone-automating-order-taking-at-fast-food-drive-thrus)
    targets large fast food drive-thrus, helping them automate order-taking processes
    and increase profitability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to just picking up GPT / LLMs and exposing them through a UI, several
    startups are taking a step further by integrating with existing software that
    their customers already use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A prime example of this is [Lightski](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IHv-lightski-chatgpt-for-sales-teams),
    which focuses on integrating with customer relationship management (CRM) software
    such as Salesforce. Their goal is to enable customers to update their CRM by simply
    sending a natural language message through Slack, eliminating the need to navigate
    through layers of user interfaces. [Yuma.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IBB-yuma-chatgpt-for-customer-support)
    offers a one-click installation feature into help desk software, combining the
    power of LLMs with the customers’ own knowledge base, generating draft responses
    for service agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These integrations have been a big driver towards unlocking new use cases that
    out-of-the-box LLM application like ChatGPT cannot easily solve.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Leveraging LLMs in conjunction with other AI technologies
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Startups are exploring creating a differentiated product by using other AI technologies
    such as computer vision and predictions in conjunction with LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One such example is [Automat](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/I6p-lasso-robotic-process-automation-for-chrome-using-chatgpt-and-computer-vision),
    whose customers provide a video demonstration of a repetitive Chrome process they
    wish to automate. Automat then utilizes computer vision techniques applied to
    screen recordings, along with human natural language input to create the desired
    automations. Another startup called [Persana AI](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IDv-persana-ai-sales-copilot-to-boost-productivity)
    takes advantage of CRM data integrations and publicly available data to predict
    potential hot leads for sales teams. They then employ LLMs to draft personalized
    outbound messages for each identified lead, utilizing available custom data about
    the individual (you can see a demo [here](https://www.persana.ai/)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Incorporating a combination of technologies is helping these startups create
    a moat and differentiation from generic LLM applications.
  prefs: []

- en: 4\. Customization of LLMs
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many startups are offering customization options based on users’ past data and
    language style to customize the LLM models used by a customer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, [Speedy](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/I7a-speedy-democratizing-marketing-to-smbs),
    a platform that assists SMBs in generating marketing content, conducts branding
    workshops with their customers. The insights gathered from these workshops are
    then fed into their models, allowing Speedy to capture and incorporate the unique
    voice and brand identity of each business into the generated content. Along similar
    lines, [Yuma.ai](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IBB-yuma-chatgpt-for-customer-support)
    focuses on learning the writing style from previous helpdesk tickets. By analyzing
    the patterns and language used in these interactions, Yuma.ai is able to generate
    draft responses that align with the established style, ensuring consistency and
    personalization in customer communications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Creative user interfaces
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most underrated levers that startups are starting to leverage is
    building unique and useful UI interfaces, which most current LLM products (like
    chatGPT, Bard) are not great at. These interfaces, when customized to specific
    uses cases, can unlock a ton of new value to customers and bring in more users
    in the fold who have not yet adopted existing products given the difficulty to
    use.

    helps both individual consumers and organizations be more effective. These products
    undoubtedly will be a huge unlock for productivity and effectiveness in solving
    problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to poke holes at their long term defensibility. For example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a startup is built on the premise of taking base LLMs like GPT, building
    integrations into helpdesk software to understand knowledge base & writing style,
    and then generating draft responses, what’s stopping a helpdesk software giant

    content generation, what’s stopping Google Docs (that is already experimenting
    with auto-drafting) and Microsoft word (that is already experimenting with Copilot
    tools) to copy that? One step further, what’s stopping them from providing a 25%
    worse product and giving it away for free with an existing product suite (eg.
    Microsoft Teams taking over Slack’s market share)?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The companies that don’t have a moat could still be successful in their current
    form, and the nature of what they do makes them attractive acquisition targets,
    both from a feature add-on and from a talent perspective. However, building a
    moat would be critical for startups that are interested in turning these early
    ideas into huge successes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One clear approach is building a full product that solves for a problem space
    and is heavily using AI as part of their feature (vs an AI-only product that’s
    an add-on on top of an existing problem space).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    focused on the problem space of helping creators build more engaging courses in
    a Tiktok-esque format, with some AI features as part of their offering (like conversational
    Q&A). [KURUKURU](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/IDT-kurukuru-3d-engine-in-the-browser-for-comics-creation)
    is building a 3D engine for creating comics, and has some AI features around creating
    characters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another approach is beefing up the product offering (going from an AI feature
    to a broader product for the problem space) by leveraging some of the above trends
    in tandem with each other — data integrations, BYOD models, enabling customizations,
    combining with other AI technologies.
