    you’ll often come across probability questions. But here’s the thing: some people
    are sure that these questions don’t have much to do with the real job. Questions
    like, “Why should we bother calculating the chance of rolling a 6 five times with
    a dice?” often come up. In this article, I’m going to share some real-life examples
    to explain why understanding probability matters more than you might think. For
    that, let’s take some interview tasks and see their applications in the real world.'

    customers can rate the food’s quality. The team’s primary goal is to deliver top-tier
    service, and if a restaurant receives bad reviews, you need to check it. So, here’s
    the big question — how many bad reviews should trigger a restaurant check-up?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, a restaurant can end up with some not-so-great feedback just occasionally,
    and it’s not their fault. If a restaurant has handled 1000 orders, they might
    get a couple of bad reviews by chance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Think of it like this: about 5% of orders end up with negative reviews just
    by chance. Then the number of bad reviews per restaurant follows a Binomial distribution
    *Bin(n, p)*, with “n” being the orders and “p” the likelihood of a bad review
    (which is 5% in our case).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, if a restaurant has 100 orders, there’s about a 23.4% chance they’ll get
    at least 7 bad reviews and a much smaller 2.8% chance they’ll get at least 10\.
    You can check this using a calculator [here](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html),
    your parameters are *n=100*, *x=10*, *p=0.05*, and don’t forget to choose option
    *x>=X*.

    100 orders, you might end up checking on restaurants too often, which means extra
    costs for you and more pressure on the restaurants.'

    have just introduced a new payment method, and you’re curious about how often
    customers are using this new feature. But here’s the catch — due to a little bug,
    about 2% of requests to the new payment method fail. In other words, customers
    get to see this new payment option in 98% of their sessions. To figure out how
    often a customer chooses this payment method, you want to focus on those who had
    it available all the time. But here’s where it gets tricky.
  prefs: []

- en: Think about a user with just one session — you exclude them from your analysis
    with a 2% probability. Now, consider a user with 25 sessions. For them, the chance
    of not having the feature available in *at least one session* is 1–0.98²⁵ = 39.7%.
    So, you might unintentionally leave out some of your most loyal customers with
    a higher chance, and that could skew your analysis.

    people still pay for rides with cash, which can be a hassle for drivers. They
    have to carry change, deal with cash transactions, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your team is worried that if a driver gets three cash orders in a row, they
    might get frustrated and run out of change. So, you’re thinking about limiting
    cash orders in such situations. But before doing that, you want to figure out
    how often this really happens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say the average number of trips per driver per day is 10, and 10% of those
    trips are paid in cash.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, the probability of getting 3 consecutive cash trips is 0.1*0.1*0.1 = 0.001\.
    But it can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd trip; 2nd, 3rd, 4th trip, and so on. That means the
    chance of getting three cash trips in a row is just 8*0.1*0.1*0.1 = 0.008\. It
    seems to be pretty low, you might want to hold off on implementing this feature
    for now.

    a customer will return their loan. Overall, 85% of all loans typically get repaid.

- en: What’s the whole point of this article? It highlights that understanding probability
    and combinatorics is essential for data scientists and analysts. In your daily
    life, you’ll encounter situations where a grasp of probability is necessary; otherwise,
    you might draw incorrect conclusions. However, from the perspective of employers,
    interview questions should be more practical to help future analysts recognize
    the practical applicability of this knowledge at work.
