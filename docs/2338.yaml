    sake of change; “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is a common folksy idiom for
    a reason: it’s very often the correct approach.'

    frustrating days at work typically come about when our time-tested methods fail
    to produce our expected outcomes or perform poorly. This is where expanding our
    knowledge base really pays off: instead of getting stuck in the mental equivalent
    of a spinning wheel of death, we try something different, tinker with our process,
    and (sooner or later) move forward with a new solution.'

    excellent recent posts that offer an original spin on common machine learning
    workflows. They cover procedures like drift detection and model training and tasks
    ranging from image segmentation to named-entity recognition. Make room in your
    toolkit—you’ll want to add these!

    services, and their outputs can sometimes feel repetitive and obvious. As [Christabelle
    Pabalan](https://medium.com/u/4200eb8e8b26?source=post_page-----eeedd99f39e6--------------------------------)
    shows, [**there’s no reason to settle for uninspired choices**](/beyond-accuracy-embracing-serendipity-and-novelty-in-recommendations-for-long-term-user-retention-701a23b1cb34)—in
    fact, injecting recommender systems with elements of novelty and serendipity can
    result in better user retention.

    in LLM-powered apps, ”is a fairly new topic, and there are no ‘best practice’
    methods,” say [Elena Samuylova](https://medium.com/u/9621354b583a?source=post_page-----eeedd99f39e6--------------------------------)
    and Olga Filippova. [**To help you pick the most effective approach**](/how-to-measure-drift-in-ml-embeddings-ee8adfe1e55e),
    they ran several experiments and share clear recommendations based on their findings.
