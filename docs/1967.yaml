    changing (and rapidly growing) footprint in our daily lives—an unexpected side
    effect, perhaps, of the technology crossing over from research and industry communities
    to every corner of social media. There’s certainly a lot of hype, as well as nontrivial
    amounts of doom-and-gloom prophecies and an endless parade of new tools and apps.
    But what does it all *mean*?

    few months to help you get acquainted with practical topics like prompt engineering
    and voice-to-text automation. Today, we invite you to take a step (or two) back
    to explore some of the bigger themes our authors have written about as they grappled
    with AI’s shifting role in data science and machine learning workflows. Let’s
    dive in.

    limitations, from its tendency to hallucinate to its inability to provide real-time
