- en: Time series analysis is one of the most common data science tasks. It involves
    analyzing trends in data points that are ordered temporally. There are a wide
    variety of time series data including stock market data, weather data, consumer
    demand data, and much more. Time series analysis has applications across a wide
    range of industries which makes it an essential skill for data scientists and
    data analysts.

    a single article. Some of the most common approaches include visualizing time
    series data through line charts, building time series forecasting models, performing
    spectral analysis for uncovering cyclic trends, analyzing seasonality trends,
    and more.

- en: Because time series analysis involves many different techniques it naturally
    lends itself to object-oriented programming. Python classes make it easy to organize
    attributes and methods for related time series tasks. For example, if as a data
    scientist, you often perform line chart visualizations, seasonality analysis,
    and time series forecasting, classes can allow you to easily organize methods
    and attributes for these tasks.
