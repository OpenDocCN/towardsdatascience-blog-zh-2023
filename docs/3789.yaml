    a lot in my student's journey on using ChatGPT. Post ChatGPT era, my students
    just copied and pasted the 1-line error message from their Command Line Interface
    despite the error being 100 lines and linked to some modules and dependencies.
    Asking ChatGPT to explain the workaround by providing a 1 line error code might
    work sometimes, or worse ‚Äî it might add 1‚Äì2 hour manhour of debugging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT comes with a limitation of not being able to see the context of your
    code. For sure, you can always give a context of your code. On a more complex
    code, you might not be able to give every line of code to ChatGPT. The fact that
    Chat GPT only sees the small portion of your code, ChatGPT will either **assume**
    the rest of the code based on its knowledge base or **hallucinate**.
