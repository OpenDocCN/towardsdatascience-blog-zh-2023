    for the employees of Enefit (one of the largest energy companies in the Baltics).
    In the first article ([read here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developing-company-specific-chatgpt-forenefit-kristjan-eljand)),
    I overviewed the problem, development process, and initial results. In this article,
    I will delve into the significance of the non-technology related challenges in
    developing a virtual assistant.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the beginning of 2023, it was clear that a breakthrough had occurred in the
    technology of large language models. Unlike the chatbots from the past decade
    that often disappointed users by the second or third question, ChatGPT came out
    as precise, versatile, and genuinely helpful. The decision by OpenAI and Microsoft
    to offer programmatic access to their GPT models, through an open API service,
    created the opportunity to implement company-specific use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We approached the Enefit virtual assistant project knowing that the base technology
    was ready, internal interest was high, and the software development challenge
    that, while novel and complex, was achievable with good specialists.

    of the project activities consisted of software development tasks, and 20% were
    non-technology related activities. As the project progressed, these proportions
    changed drastically, leading to the need for entirely new processes and roles.'

    as the underlying documents permit. In other words, if the foundational documents
    contain incorrect, poorly structured, or outdated information, the virtual assistant
    can’t provide much better answers. This is commonly referred to as the GIGO (garbage
    in, garbage out) principle, which sets fundamental limits to AI capabilities.

    who provide continuous feedback and data owners responsible for responding to

    the information under their purview by enriching document sections with keywords,
    testing the virtual assistant’s accuracy, restructuring content when necessary,
    testing, improving, testing, improving, … In essence, information owners should
    view the virtual assistant as a colleague with whom they need to collaborate!

    all eyes are on the launch of Copilot. Most tech enthusiasts have watched the
    demo videos and expect it to be a plug-and-play product that semi-magically provides
    good answers to company-related questions. However, this expectation will likely
    lead to disappointment, as even Copilot isn’t immune to the GIGO principle.

    to emphasize that no virtual assistant technology can be successfully implemented
    without a data governance process.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Large pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT, Llama) are robotic logic machines.
    This means that if we want them to fulfill a specific role (e.g., executive assistant,
    contract assistant, legal expert), we need to guide them and provide style examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Directing the virtual assistant means giving the language model both the user’s
    question and a response guide. For example, “*You are a virtual assistant of Enefit
    who knows about company policies and rules. If you can’t find the answer in the
    available information, say you don’t know…*”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this type of guidance, we can instruct the virtual assistant on how to
    behave, dictate the format it should use to respond, and highlight what it should
    avoid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a general guide is often insufficient. For instance, a company may
    want the virtual assistant to follow a specific style (formal, friendly, etc.).
    In such cases, style examples, which are essentially question-answer pairs, can
    be provided. As language models are trained to continue existing text, the virtual
    assistant tries to answer user questions similarly to the provided style examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating response guides and style examples, testing different versions, and
    refining them constitutes the third significant part of virtual assistant development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ‘Virtual Assistant Trainer/Guide’ role is entirely new and can be effectively
    filled only by someone knowledgeable in the domain for which the virtual assistant
    is created. Effective development of the virtual assistant necessitates close
    collaboration among software developers, information owners, and the virtual assistant
    trainer, since the cause of each ‘poor’ response could lie with different specialists.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing a chatbot that functions at 80% efficiency is easy with today’s technologies,
    but creating a virtual assistant with 95% quality is a complex task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first glance, one might think that 80% is sufficient, so why go through so
    much trouble for the last 20 percentage points? In reality, based on the experience
    of the past decade with chatbots, we know that a chatbot that is precise 80% of
    the time does not surpass the “cognitive usefulness threshold” of users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This cognitive usefulness threshold is a hidden benchmark that exists in all
    our minds, but we cannot precisely define where this limit lies. However, using
    technology, we quickly understand whether or not this limit has been crossed.
    If the quality of the technology falls below this threshold, we will completely
    abandon the use of the given technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, the difference between 80% and 95% lies in the fact that in
    the first case, no one will start using this technology, and in the second case,
    it becomes an everyday assistant for many employees.

    system that ensures the relevance of the foundational information, create new
    roles and processes associated with the development of the virtual assistant,
    train all parties on the new technology, and support the implementation and adoption
    at both strategic and operational levels. Therefore, technology only constitutes
    1/3 of the virtual assistant development, while organizational and process-related
    challenges make up the remainder.
