    passion for the possibilities of the human imagination and rationality, would
    have found most astounding about our present-day technology. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/there-is-no-clash-between-art-and-science-3028d0420fbe),
    dreaming of flying machines, would have surely been impressed by an Airbus 380
    soaring through the air, with passengers comfortably reclining in their chairs,
    watching movies, and complaining about the Wi-Fi not being fast enough.

    times, the wonders of generative AI might be among the most witchcrafty. What
    would Leonardo, after laboring endless years on the portrait of the Mona Lisa,
    have said if I showed him a device that could paint a portrait of a woman in his
    style in mere seconds? Lo and behold:'

    as the real Mona Lisa (and looks, upon further inspection, somewhat ridiculous),
    many of us have encountered astonishing instances of AI generations: from [ultrarealistic
    images](https://twitter.com/mariswaran/status/1674505829456965633) to eerily convincing
    deep fakes of voices or even entire essays written by AI.'
