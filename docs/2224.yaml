- en: The other day I was trying to decipher how a script I built in the past worked.
    I knew what it did, it was pretty well explained and documented, but understanding
    the how was more troublesome.

- en: The code was tedious and complex, with some comments here and there but lacking
    proper styling. That’s when I decided to learn about PEP 8[1] and integrate it
    into my code.

- en: In case you don’t know what PEP 8 is, it’s basically a document that provides
    guidelines, coding conventions, and best practices on how to write Python code.

    never invested our time to read it and integrate those guidelines into our daily
    practices.

    so much and my codes are now starting to look better.

- en: One of my favorite findings was the **type hints** (or **type annotations**)
    — which will be the topic of today’s post. In fact, type hints already appeared
    on PEP 3107[2], back in 2006, and were revisited and fully documented in the 484[3]
    version (in 2014). Since then, it’s been improved several times on new PEP versions
    and it’s almost become a classic.
