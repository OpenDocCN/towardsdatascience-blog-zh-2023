- en: As a marathon runner, I use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3546831).
    A lot. It’s a wonderful app. In addition to all the usual social features (sharing
    activities, keeping up with what my friends are doing, checking my club’s activities
    etc.) I rely on Strava to track all of my activities and I use it regularly to
    analyse my training progress. Or at least I try to. I like to use [*Strava’s training
    log*](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/206535704-Training-Log) to
    review how my current training is going, compared with previous years, but unfortunately,
    this is not where Strava really shines, even though the training log is a premium
    feature.

- en: Part of the problem is the very limited information provided by the training
    log. For instance, in the example training log below we see several weeks' worth
    of activities (the coloured circles) which provide a summary of the frequency
    and distance of training activities but without any information on training intensity
    or effort. So, I thought it would be an interesting side-project to look at how
    we might improve upon this…
