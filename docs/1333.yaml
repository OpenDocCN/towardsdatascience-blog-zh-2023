- en: In our fast-paced world, we generate enormous amounts of audio data. Think about
    your favorite podcast or conference calls at work. The data is already rich in
    its raw form; we, as humans, can understand it. Even so, we could go further and,
    for example, convert it into a written format to search for it later.

    first is transcription, simply converting spoken language into text. A second
    one that we explore in this article is diarization. Diarization helps us give
    additional structure to the unstructured content. In this case, we are interested
    in attributing specific speech segments to different speakers.

- en: With the above context, we address both tasks by using different tools. We use
    Whisper, a general-purpose speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It was
    training on a diverse dataset of audio samples, and the researchers developed
    it to perform multiple tasks. Secondly, we use PyAnnotate, a library for speaker
    diarization. Finally, we use WhisperX, a research project that helps combine the
    two while solving some limitations of Whisper.
