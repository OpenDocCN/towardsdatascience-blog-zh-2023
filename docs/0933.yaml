    even though my taste was often different from what Billboard presented to me.
    Usually, my favorite songs ended up failing to reach the top positions. Despite
    that, it was a great source of new and good songs for me. I even liked to check
    which songs were popular in the past. I found out, for instance, that on the week
    I was born, on August 1987, [*I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3-5YC_oHjE)was
    the number one song on the [Hot Billboard 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1987-08-08/)!

    are the best football teams in 2023? Who was the best tennis player in 2022 and
    what was the most used programming language on GitHub last year? We want to know
    what’s trending right now. But as with everything in life, ranks change all the
    time.

- en: In this lesson, you will learn how to show changes in rank with basic [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
    with no need for additional libraries. As an example, you will use data published
    by the [Octoverse Report 2022,](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)
    which analyzed the most popular programming languages in 2022.
