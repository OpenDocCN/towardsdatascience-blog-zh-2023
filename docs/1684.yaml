    many calculations found in data science. Coincidentally, I had to take a calculus
    course as part of the requirements for my university degree. Since I was having
    to pay for the calculus course, I decided to use it to teach myself the calculus
    I would need for data science. However, the learning materials from my university
    were so atrocious that it took me five months to learn functions, limits, and
    differentiation. It was soul-sucking. That is until I found the best math teacher

    Yes, the forward movement may be slow at times, but there should never be a complete
    stop or a reverse of direction — there are too many different learning resources

    can attest to the fact that you should not be studying for any longer than 6–7
    hours per day. Studying is an intensive form of brain use that is completely different
    than how you would use your brain working an 8-hour-a-day job. For example, working
    8 hours a day does not mean that you’re using your brain intensively for all of
    those 8 hours. Some of those hours will be spent on energy-intensive tasks, but
    for the most part, your day will be spent using your brain less intensively, such

    Studying requires 100% of your concentration to do it effectively (especially

- en: Vacations, birthdays, events, and even weekends are great hard deadlines that
    can be used to motivate you to get your work done. Nothing feels better than getting
    all of your work done on Friday and knowing that your weekend is now open to do
    anything. The same goes for not having to worry about work during your vacation,
    your friend’s birthday party, or your child’s school play. Whatever the occasion,
    date, or end-of-week ritual, finding a hard deadline to structure your learning
    around can help motivate even the biggest procrastinator to teach themselves data
    science.
