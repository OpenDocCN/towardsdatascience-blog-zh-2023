    science, and the next you’re finding excuses as to why you don’t have the time
    to study today. We all know that there are only so many times you can wash the
    walls of your apartment, clean out your refrigerator, or walk the dog before you’re
    stuck sitting in front of your computer again, trying to summon some form of excitement
    for studying.

    I understand the drain that self-studying can have, especially in the motivation
    department. However, I’ve also become somewhat of an expert in developing methods
    to have the motivation to study every single day. While some people need the structure
    of a classroom to get any studying done, it is possible to develop your own practices
    that can keep you excited to study every day. Well, maybe not excited, but at
    least able to sit down and focus for a study period every day.

    many calculations found in data science. Coincidentally, I had to take a calculus
    course as part of the requirements for my university degree. Since I was having
    to pay for the calculus course, I decided to use it to teach myself the calculus
    I would need for data science. However, the learning materials from my university
    were so atrocious that it took me five months to learn functions, limits, and
    differentiation. It was soul-sucking. That is until I found the best math teacher
    on Youtube. [Professor Leonard’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54_XRjHhZzI&list=PLF797E961509B4EB5&index=7)
    calculus lectures were life-changing, and I found myself able to teach myself
    calculus through these videos in record time compared to when I was using the
    materials my university had provided.

    are helping you learn at pace, instead of keeping your wheels spinning for weeks
    on end trying to understand a concept. Nothing will kill your motivation quicker
    than being stuck trying to understand a concept for longer than one month.

- en: In sum, there’s no good reason why you should stick with a learning resource
    if it’s draining your will to live by not being conducive to moving your studies
    forward. Self-studying data science should always be a form of forward progression.
    Yes, the forward movement may be slow at times, but there should never be a complete
    stop or a reverse of direction — there are too many different learning resources
    out there for that to happen. All you need to do is be able to admit when something
    isn’t working and change tactics to something that will.

    These communities are great opportunities to keep yourself motivated to study,
    but also to get your questions answered immediately when you get stuck on a topic.
    Communicating with like-minded people is also a great way to learn more about
    the data science industry, network, and become a more well-rounded data scientist

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you’re self-studying data science, it can be difficult to determine exactly
    how much you should be studying every day. This can be compounded when you don’t
    have other commitments, which can leave your entire day open to studying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Social media has made the toxic study culture even more prevalent, with many people
    posting about how many hours a day they study. This can put unnecessary pressure
    on you to also be studying 12 hours a day.

- en: While the amount of time that everyone can study effectively is different, I
    can attest to the fact that you should not be studying for any longer than 6–7
    hours per day. Studying is an intensive form of brain use that is completely different
    than how you would use your brain working an 8-hour-a-day job. For example, working
    8 hours a day does not mean that you’re using your brain intensively for all of
    those 8 hours. Some of those hours will be spent on energy-intensive tasks, but
    for the most part, your day will be spent using your brain less intensively, such
    as going to meetings, answering emails, and taking breaks.

- en: Comparatively, your brain is being continuously worked hard while studying.
    Studying requires 100% of your concentration to do it effectively (especially
    when you’re exploring topics such as calculus and neural networks), which is why
    studying for 6–7 hours should be your maximum goal every day. This also takes
    into account the fact that you need to take care of yourself in other ways during
    your study day, including rest, socialization, exercise, and nutrition.
  prefs: []

- en: When your brain learns that it only has to work hard for up to 6 hours a day,
    you’ll likely find that it becomes easier to focus for those 6 hours. You’ll no
    longer feel like being distracted by your phone because you know that you’ll only
    have 6 hours to get through your learning tasks for the day. You’ll also find
    that you feel more refreshed going into the next day of studying because your
    brain has had ample time to rest. You may also find that your retention of material
    learned is greater, as your brain has more time to build strong connections to
    the material that you’ve learned without being constantly bombarded by new information.

- en: Let’s face it — not all topics in data science are created equal. Unfortunately,
    the good stuff, such as machine learning, data visualization, and real-world applications
    can only come after you’ve learned code, mathematics, and communication skills.
    With topics like these to grind through, it can be difficult to remain motivated
    for the good stuff yet to come.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my favorite techniques to get past this slump is to find the practical
    applications of the material that inspire me. For example, learning limits and
    differentiation can be pretty draining, but only if you forget that they can be
    used to determine the rate of change of a function which can tell you all sorts
    of cool things, like how climate change is quickening, costs of goods are increasing,
    or how access to healthcare is declining.

    (such as in healthcare, science, engineering, business, education, etc.), then
    it becomes easy to find the different ways that you can apply the knowledge you’re
    developing. For example, once you’ve mastered data analysis, you could do some
    pro bono work for a small business in your community to help them increase their
    sales. Or, you could create a predictive model of how many people would be affected
    by a particular natural disaster as a portfolio project.

- en: One of the things I’ve seen people struggle with while self-teaching data science
    is a lack of motivation due to no structured time-sensitive goals. Many have said
    to me that they could never teach themselves data science because they don’t have
    the motivation to sit down and get their work done. However, this is simply due
    to a lack of structure.
  prefs: []

- en: One of the great benefits of going to school is that you’re in a structured
    environment with deadlines. Deadlines for assignments, deadlines for exams, and
    deadlines for graduation. You name it and there’s a deadline for it. This time-sensitive
    structure helps people focus and get down to work without even trying too hard.
    As I mentioned above, even if you leave it to the very last minute, you’re going
    to complete your work because you know there’s a hard deadline to abide by.
  prefs: []

    to set time-sensitive learning objectives that you see as hard deadlines.

    only want to be out of work for so many months. For others, this can be more difficult
    because there may not be a specific time crunch that you’re working against.
  prefs: []

- en: Vacations, birthdays, events, and even weekends are great hard deadlines that
    can be used to motivate you to get your work done. Nothing feels better than getting
    all of your work done on Friday and knowing that your weekend is now open to do
    anything. The same goes for not having to worry about work during your vacation,
    your friend’s birthday party, or your child’s school play. Whatever the occasion,
    date, or end-of-week ritual, finding a hard deadline to structure your learning
    around can help motivate even the biggest procrastinator to teach themselves data
    science.
