- en: With the technological advances of recent years, especially since the turn of
    the millennium, data science has become a discipline in its own right, separate
    from computer science and more closely aligned to statistics. It has carved out
    a niche for itself where data scientists apply themselves to solving business
    problems that rely on the access, processing and ultimately the interpretation
    of data.

    languages, for example Python and R, to help simplify analytics workflows required
    to access large disparate data sets. The data scientist’s skillset combined with
    that of the economist delivers a winning formula for those looking to distinguish
    themselves from the herd and master modern economics.

    of Economics [1] has extended its curriculum in recent years to include an undergraduate
    degree titled the BSc Data Science and Business Analytics, with the strapline
    promising learners that they would “learn to analyse data to address real world-problems”,
    real-world problems which are naturally based in economic and business relations.
