- en: 'A few weeks ago, there was a discussion about fines in coffee where another
    [coffee enthusiast](https://www.instagram.com/quantitativecafe) noticed an anomaly
    for grounds less than 100um in diameter. I started looking more at some of my
    data and also found the trend he was seeing. However, I found another issue: binning.'

- en: Particle distributions are made by binning particles and forming a histogram.
    How many particles are within 90um and 100um in size? What is the percentage of
    the total or what is the percentage of the total volume for those particles? Those
    are the types of questions answered by particle distributions.
  prefs: []

- en: This is a sample particle distribution using the same binning used in a laser
    particle analyzer. When measuring particles, you count how many particles like
    within a certain bin, and each bin has a range. This forms a histogram, and typically,
    histograms have equal bin sizes. In my field, they are prevalent in discussing
    the variations of color values in an image.

- en: However, it seems laser particle analyzers use a log scale for bin size. This
    is very problematic because it changes how the curve looks and how we interpret
    the data. This graph shows the bin size at different particle sizes.

    20 um bins to see how it affects the signal.

- en: This is hard to compare, so I normalized all the curves. At 1um, there is a
    lot of noise because there is a wide variation in the number of samples. I can
    test this and improve the noise using multiple measurements or for laser diffraction,
    more particles could be put through.

    there with 10 um bins.

- en: Another way to view the data is to normalize by bin size. Where in the original
    image, there seemed to be two peaks below 100um and a tiny bump, once normalized,
    the third peak is more apparent.

    aim is to really use these to understand coffee, we need better binning from the
    equipment we have.
