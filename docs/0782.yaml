    Each particle shown in this model of the minimalist JCVI-syn3A cell is a whole
    macromolecule, modeled at coarse-grained level which means that small sets of
    atoms were groups into beads (see text for details).

- en: Advances in technology and the rise of data science have led to an exciting
    new era in biological research, as scientists use computational methods to gain
    a deeper understanding of the inner workings of cells. In fact, computer-based
    data analysis and mathematical modeling is today ubiquitous in chemistry, biology,
    and actually all branches of science. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular,
    have been instrumental in revealing the movements and interactions of individual
    atoms, providing crucial insights into cellular processes. However, these simulations
    have traditionally been limited to small systems due to their computational demands.
    Recent breakthroughs, as I present here, are close to enabling the first computational
    simulations of whole cells, offering a groundbreaking opportunity to model the
    tiniest complete biological units at near-atomic level. This new approach, rooted
    in pure physics, is set to revolutionize our understanding of cells and their
    complex behavior, opening up new avenues for research and discovery in data-driven
    biology. In this article, I present and discuss the mathematical modeling and
    data science…
