    article on *Towards Data Science*, I refer to how data science can be applied
    at various phases of the content lifecycle, from greenlight to production to release.
    Though it’s easy to conceptualize how applications of data science might differ
    between, say, deciding what scripts should be greenlit and determining how production
    costs can be optimized, there can be stark differences even across contexts that,
    at first sight, might seem relatively similar.

    from the streaming tech side of the business, I expected things to be more or
    less similar, except that this time I’d be working with movie data exclusively
    rather than both TV and movie data. Predicting how popular things are gonna be
    using data, how crazy different could things be?

    are different, the data is different, etc. So I wanted to write this piece with
    two goals in mind. The first more obvious goal is to show aspiring and junior
    entertainment data professionals how data science work can differ between theatrical
    and streaming contexts. But I imagine this kind of dynamic can manifest in a lot
    of different industries — where you think you’ll be doing largely the same predict
    Y using X thing you always did only to find out it’s entirely different takes
    on X and Y — so the second broader goal is to give data professionals in all fields
    an idea of how even though two jobs may seem functionally similar to a remarkable
    degree on the surface, they can be totally different in various ways once you
    really start digging in to the data and the business questions at hand.

    streaming entertainment data science to theatrical entertainment data science.
    I skip over some of the more blatantly “no duh” points (oh, there’s no theatrical
    TV show releases, what a surprise), but I touch on some of the major trends. And
    of course, none of this is some biblical statement of truth; YMMV based on company,
    team leadership, and the like. Furthermore, although data science can play a role
    in earlier phases of the entertainment content lifecycle as I allude to above,
    this piece derives from my experience with more downstream processes nearer to
    release. If I ever seem a bit ambiguous, that’s deliberately because I don’t wanna
    spill any of the secret sauce ;)

- en: The most immediately obvious is the difference in the sheer scope of data. In
    theatrical data science, the primary unit of analysis is the movie, perhaps the
    movie-country — and there’s only so many movies that come out in a given country
    in a given year! This is as opposed to in streaming data science, where you often
    have access to person-content-time level data on consumption of titles from across
    history, leading to datasets that are far larger (and leading to the need for
    different tools to work with them).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This isn’t to say you never work with larger datasets that come in at more granular
    levels on the theatrical side; these datasets are generally tied to the title
    or some element of the title and you often work with them and process them in
    some way to generate title-relevant insights. But the bottom line is that because
    the title space is smaller by default, the scope of data is smaller. I do hope
    that one day, we can get more of the granular, individual-level insight into consumption
    in the theatrical domain that’s possible in the streaming domain, but at least
    as it is now, that’s not the case.

- en: In streaming, the vast majority of the time (with the obvious exception of streaming
    exclusive releases), you’re going to have some significant amount of historical
    data to work with. How much did the title make at the box office? How was the
    social media buzz around it when it came out? How did the title do on Rotten Tomatoes?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You do not have this luxury in the theatrical space. Sure, you can to some extent
    lean on the history of particular components, whether they be cast, crew, genre,
    or some combination, but even then those data points generally will not be as
    clearly linkable to a particular title as literal historical data. Plus, such
    comparisons can be riddled with subjectivity concerns and exogenous confounding
    factors; how is it decided what titles are truly comparable to others? What role
    does marketing and differences in marketing campaigns play in the public’s perception
    of similarity between titles?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Yes, series and franchises are a half-exception to this rule, but over-reliance
    on sequelitis and similarity presumptions can easily backfire. Yes, in many cases,
    the performance of a predecessor can be a decent eyeball estimate of its successor,
    but franchises can lose steam over time or be overextended (new characters/plots
    and weak linkages to past titles) beyond recognition such that earlier title performance
    can be meaningless in predicting the performance of newer titles.*'

- en: Coming from startup streaming tech territory with a data team run by tech people,
    I spent a lot of time doing research on what datasets might be useful for our
    needs. Over the course of such work, I found lots of obscure datasets fitting
    various needs and investigated how we might be able to cheaply collect data that
    vendors sold for a high price (e.g. how can we get Google search data without
    paying for an expensive license?).
  prefs: []

- en: On the theatrical side, the standards and conventions seem far more established.
    There are certain consumer and social media datasets or dataset types that more
    or less everyone in the industry uses. For example, while social listening might
    come to mind as an obvious contemporary data source, there are major established
    vendors that provide detailed pre-release and post-release consumer data for titles,
    and some of these vendors have been around for decades. These are the kind of
    datasets that many outside the immediate theatrical space might never have heard
    of, but when you’re in the space, they’re all you ever talk about.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the streaming space, the window of availability — and to some extent, the
    nature of availability — is a huge factor in analyses. Such windows can interact
    with a variety of content- (e.g. is the title about Christmas and the window is
    a Christmas window? ) and marketplace-level factors (e.g. is the title being displayed
    prominently on the front page?).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can imagine, these concerns are less present in theatrical data science
    — or, more accurately, unless you’re doing upstream modeling related to “should
    we make this title?” or “when should we release this title?” any concerns about
    windowing factors have already been decided for you in the form of a (likely)
    release date by the time you get involved. There’s only one window to worry about
    (unless you have to worry about staggered release dates, and that’s a whole ‘nother
    ballgame), and the Powers That Be have already decided when it’ll be. Now you
    need to do your best to provide all the useful insights you can in the context
    of that window.

- en: During my time on the streaming side, it was easy to treat titles and audiences
    likes numbers because we had data on hundreds of thousands of them, but such a
    philosophy was also reflected in the methodology. It was common to not only generate
    summary statistics, but also to turn everything into some kind of vector embedding
    (i.e. a series of numbers that mean something across some human-unobservable set
    of dimensions), even if that came at the cost of interpretability; it doesn’t
    really mean anything to be able to say, “Content dimension 2 is the most important
    variable in the model”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Streaming services are run more like tech companies, but the theatrical side
    is closer to the traditional studio business. On the theatrical side, there’s
    a greater focus on the business, beyond the numbers. The data isn’t there just
    for the numbers’ sake, but for the actionable insights they can provide to various
    stakeholders around the organization, many of whom are not data scientists or
    even work with data on a day to day basis. Making accurate predictions is important,
    but just as important is interpretability, and there’s no rush to throw interpretability
    out the window just for the sake of reducing model error by a small fraction of
    a percent. In turn, I feel more connected to both the business and audiences in
    the work I do.
