    to data leaders: be obsessed with customer impact. Rob Parker, former senior director
    of data and analytics at Gitlab, knows this all too well. In fact, Gitlab open
    sources their [company handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) to ensure
    that their customers have full visibility into their vision, business priorities,
    and KPIs.'

  zh: 在此之前，我给你留一句话，这反映了我对数据领导者的最常见建议：对客户影响要有执着。前Gitlab数据与分析高级总监Rob Parker对此了解颇深。事实上，Gitlab将其[公司手册](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)开源，以确保客户对他们的愿景、业务优先级和KPI有全面的了解。
- en: “It’s very easy as a team embedded in the business that’s not directly impacting
    or interfacing with our customers to lose sight of what our work means to our
    customers,” said Rob. “So we try to think about our customer’s customer. We’ve
    been able to move away from being the typical order taker into being a trusted
    business partner in the journey of building scalable and reliable solutions for
    the business.”

  zh: Rob说：“作为一个嵌入在业务中、没有直接影响或与客户互动的团队，很容易忽视我们工作的意义。所以我们尽量考虑我们客户的客户。我们已经能够从典型的接单者转变为在为业务构建可扩展和可靠的解决方案的过程中成为值得信赖的业务合作伙伴。”
