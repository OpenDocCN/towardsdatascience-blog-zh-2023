    those who proactively lead the organization towards its needs.

    quality monitoring system in place; a means for understanding how an incident
    will impact what and who within the organization; and a process for informing
    those stakeholders. Quick Slack pings can do the job, but the best in class solution
    I’ve seen for this is placing a notice on the BI dashboard itself either through
    a [data observability/data catalog integration](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-atlan-monte-carlo-integration)

    terms. Things like, “we have built X pipelines,” or “we have reduced latency by
    25 percent.” They make their budget requests the same way. “We need an X so we
    can do Y.”

    these days even headcount) are seen as unnecessary line items to be minimized.
    After being pressed by the CFO, “if they REALLY need this,” they either abandon
    the initiative or **turn to stitching together a bevy of piecemeal open source
    solutions like Frankenstein’s monster.**
