    I’ve been fascinated by the ability to create lifelike digital doubles and level-up
    entertainment. Before getting into my research, I had assumed that these models
    can cause far too much harm to be released to a general audience. Over the past
    few months, I’ve noticed an ever-increasing number of the top voices arguing for
    Artificial Intelligence as a field to make open-source software one of our core
    tenets. While this discussion almost exclusively centres on LLMs, it seems to
    me that the idea is common across the field. I am fully in favour of open-sourcing
    almost all AI models, but when it comes to my own research area I am less sure.

    how deepfakes work, at a level that does not require a PhD to understand. Yet,
    I often wonder if this is the correct approach. **The purpose of this article
    is to try and start a conversation about the direction we deepfake researchers
    should take.** With that in mind, in this article, I cover some of the pros and
    cons of open sourcing.

    forgiven for asking why researchers like me should even consider creating open-source
    models. There are, however, a lot of legitimate reasons to do so:'

- en: '**Transparency:** For me, this is the big one. If most major deepfake models
    are completely open-sourced, then they become transparent. In doing so, it becomes
    possible for regulators to understand what they are dealing with and for other
    researchers to develop better detection algorithms. When it comes to deepfakes,
    **there will be an arms race** between those who wish to do harm using them (bad
    actors), and those trying to prevent that harm (good actors). You can be sure
    “bad actors” will develop their deepfakes whether we release our models or not.
    In open sourcing, we give “good actors” more data on which to build their harm
    prevention models.'

    access to talent and computational resources can create deepfakes. Speaking from
    experience it takes a long time to learn to develop these models, and without
    open-source software, not many people can do so. This can serve further to concentrate
    power into the hands of the already powerful. Deepfakes can be used in several
    markets and could have potential value in the tens of billions of dollars. For
    example, [the dubbing market alone is estimated to be worth over $3.5bn](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/2023-film-dubbing-market-research-report-2030-2023-05-24#:~:text=The%20global%20Film%20Dubbing%20market,USD%205339.61%20million%20by%202028.).
    If only the likes of Google can create deepfakes, then the likes of Google alone
    can benefit from them.'

    will soon reach a point where you cannot trust any video you see online unless
    it is verified in some other way. While many people have a vague idea of this,
    I do not think many fully understand the implications. As deepfake researchers,
    it is our responsibility to help educate people. We need to really encourage everyone
    to practise good digital scepticism, to check the sources of any media they see
    online and to really question its authenticity. Open-source software helps. It
    becomes much easier to educate when the models are freely available online. If
    you can create your own deepfakes, you will naturally be on the lookout for others.'

    detection models are, there will be a small group of people that will use deepfakes
    for the worst possible reasons. From [revenge porn](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018222/deepfake-revenge-porn-coming-ban/)
    to [disinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html),
    there are some really nasty applications of this technology. If we open-source
    the models, we make it easier for all people to access them, which will undoubtedly
    cause harm. It is true that some of these bad actors will be able to do it anyway,
    particularly large criminal or national organisations, but the majority of people
    seeking to do harm may not have otherwise been able to do so, if there were no
    open-source models.'

    the misuse of deepfakes is to introduce safeguards. In particular, methods such
    as watermarking are being used by most groups that create deepfakes. Watermarking
    involves the addition of data into the created videos in a way that is invisible
    to humans and most software but can be easily identified by those that have the
    “key” to unlock them. This means, for example, YouTube or Twitter could quickly
    detect if a video was created by a deepfake platform and remove it. Because watermarks
    can only be seen by those that are given this secret key, it is not possible for
    bad actors to remove them. If we open source deepfake generation, then **it becomes
    possible for bad actors to simply skip adding the watermarks.** Making the deepfake
    undetectable.'

- en: '**One-way sharing:** If we consider again an arms race between so-called good
    and bad actors then we can see another drawback of open sourcing. If we, as the
    good actors, open-source all of our software then the bad actors can build on
    top of this. On the other hand, bad actors will not open-source their models meaning
    that information is being shared in one direction only. This gives bad actors
    a significant advantage.'

    and cons, and the potential for harm is high in either case. During the course
    of writing this article, I have had many conversations. One thing that has surprised
    me is the number of open-source absolutists. An argument I have oft heard repeated
    is that deepfakes are here and there is no putting the genie back in the bottle.
    In the opinion of many, including myself, we will reach a time in which deepfakes
    are indistinguishable from reality. If by that time we are not all aware enough
    to be questioning them we may be in great trouble as bad actors operate without
    detection. This is a point I think [recent calls for pauses in AI development
    overlook](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65746524). Yet, while open sourcing may
    reduce this long-term harm, it opens the door for short-term harm by those that
    may want to abuse deepfakes, but do not have the technical skills.

    than ever that this discussion needs to be had, and that at the least deepfake
    research needs to be done in the open and communicated to the public*.* ***I strongly
    encourage everyone to have a say. If you have an opinion that I haven’t covered
    here or any questions, please either leave a comment or contact me directly, I
    really do want to hear from as many people as possible.***
