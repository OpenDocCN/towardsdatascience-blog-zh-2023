    role. These models are able to accurately interpret the content and structure
    of documents, making them valuable tools for tasks such as invoice processing,
    resume parsing, and contract analysis. Another important benefit of deep learning
    models for document understanding is their ability to learn and adapt over time.
    As new types of documents are encountered, these models can continue to learn
    and improve their performance, making them highly scalable and efficient for tasks
    such as document classification and information extraction.

- en: One of these models is the LILT model (Language-Independent Layout Transformer),
    a deep learning model developed for the task of document layout analysis. Unlike
    it’s layoutLM predecessor, LILT is originally designed to be language-independent,
    meaning it can analyze documents in any language while achieving superior performance
    compared to other existing models in many downstream tasks application. Furthermore,
    the model has the MIT license, which means it can be used commercially unlike
    the latest layoutLM v3 and layoutXLM. Therefore, it is worthwhile to create a
    tutorial on how to fine-tune this model as it has the potential to be widely used
    for a wide range of…
