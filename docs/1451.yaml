    Transformer model for text classification, while keeping the total number of collected
    labels from human annotators low. When resource constraints prevent you from acquiring
    labels for the entirety of your data, active learning aims to save both time and

    you have a large pool of unlabeled data and a limited labeling budget. Here you
    want to decide which examples to label in order to train an accurate model. An
    important assumption of the methods presented here (and most Machine Learning)
    is that the individual examples are independent and identically distributed.

    in each round — as a baseline comparison. Before additional data are annotated,
    both approaches start with the same initial training set of 100 examples (hence
    achieving roughly the same Transformer accuracy in the first round). Because of
