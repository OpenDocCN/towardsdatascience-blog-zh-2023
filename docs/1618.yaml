    left off. You don’t need to have read it to understand what we’ll do here, but
    let me give you a quick recap (feel free to jump to section 2 if you did read
    the previous article). In a nutshell, we laid out the common problems that tourists
    face when planning a trip, and we set out to build a system that can *help us
    plan trips more effectively*, speeding up decision-making, or even fully automating
    the schedule for any given trip. We observed that stated like that, the problem
    is too complex, so we decomposed it and arrived at its essential version, and
    we called it the **minimum valuable problem**. In the end, we concluded that it
    took the form of the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
    (TSP), where the “cities” that the proverbial salesman must visit correspond,
    in our version, to the “sites of interest” in a city that a tourist desires to
    visit.

- en: So, as a kickstarter, we must first formulate and solve the TSP, and once that’s
    done, we’ll be on firm grounds to progress toward a more sophisticated and general
    solution to our trip planning problem. We chose this approach because **this article
    series aims to teach an agile approach to modeling in Operations Research (OR)**,
    so many of the lessons, tips, and tricks you’ll find here are *applicable to any
    kind of problem* you may face in OR in general.

    I know it’s tempting to focus on getting solutions, but think about it: if we

    that finds *some* solution — even if it’s optimal—, it would still be insufficient
    for us because *the TSP is not our actual problem, but a simple approximation
    to it that we’ll need to expand to make it* ***approximate*** *our real-life problem.*
    The moment we change the problem description (which we’ll do), any [solution algorithm](https://youtu.be/GiDsjIBOVoA?si=sY8LGNiehLoAXFtV)

    datum. Besides, we would never go from one place to itself again, so it is useless
    to consider pairs (𝑖, 𝑖) at all. Thus, it’s useful to limit the combinations that
    pairs (𝑖, 𝑗) can take, **so that modeling becomes easier (and *errors less likely*).**
    To that end, we now create another set, 𝔸, **derived** from 𝕊, that contains all

    that, once the variables have been decided, will **reduce to the total distance
    of the traversed path**. The way to do that is to **“add up all potentialities”**,
    *i.e.*, to do the summation over all possible arc distances 𝐷ᵢⱼ weighted by their
    binary “arc variables” 𝛿ᵢⱼ, and let the 0’s and 1’s that those variables will
    take decide which distances remain (𝐷ᵢⱼ × 1 = 𝐷ᵢⱼ) and which vanish (𝐷ᵢⱼ × 0 =
    0), in the expression for the total distance. This “summation of potentialities”
    represents the total distance the final tour will take, so it will be our objective
    (called 𝑍) to be *minimized*.

    𝛿ᵢⱼ that correspond to this “best” value of the objective constitute the (optimal)
