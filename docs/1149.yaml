    As a result, more and more people are looking for ways to reduce their carbon
    footprint and help mitigate the impact of climate change. However, it can be hard
    to know where to start or how to make a meaningful difference. We introduce a
    new way of modeling the carbon footprint of different activities using an open

    frequently, the need to take action to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) has become
    increasingly urgent. One of the key challenges is understanding the impact of
    our daily activities on the environment. However, identifying the individual reduction
    potential can be complex and difficult to understand, as hidden, embedded emissions
    often occur somewhere else and are hard to visualize.

- en: In recent years, you may have come across stunning illustrations for carbon
    footprints of daily activities such as receiving emails or streaming movies. Those
    comparisons are meant to give consumers a sense for something abstract like carbon
    emissions. They raise awareness and encourage people to take action to reduce
    their carbon footprint. However, in the interest of sound decision making, it’s
    important to validate the accuracy of these claims.

    technical specifications but also by individual factors that may considerably
    differ based on the context of the scenario. For instance, when comparing with
    a flight, the fuel consumption of your car plays a significant role. The energy
    mix of the local grid is a crucial factor when charging an electric vehicle. For
    example, [the carbon intensity of the French power sector was estimated at 58
    grams of CO₂ per kilowatt-hour in 2021, and that of Germany at 349 grams.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1291750/carbon-intensity-power-sector-eu-country/)

    footprint scenarios which improves accessibility and utility of carbon footprint
    data. It is designed to be open, linked, and modular, making it easy to share
    and reuse. The model is represented in JSON format and consists of several entities,
    each with a list of attributes and their data types. The entities include *Scenario*,
    *Scope*, *Component*, *Link*, *Source*, *Emission*, *Consumer*, and *Consumption*,
    each with their own unique attributes and relationships to other entities.

    a title which optionally includes a reference in form of a hyperlink. A scenario
    covers 1–3 **Scopes** of emission as defined by the [GHG Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf).
    This entity may contain a description. Further, it includes 1 or several **Components**
    or **Links**. The latter simply relates to another scenario which is identified
    by its URI. It may be supplemented by an indication of quantity. A component,
    however, must include a quantity and a quantity unit (e.g., “km”, “kg”, “pcs”).
    It can also have a category which defines the type of consumer (e.g., “car”, “food”,
    “electronics”). Further, this entity must include a **Source** which has a name
    and a type (e.g., “France electricity grid” and “electricity”, or “premium gasoline”
    and “gasoline”). It can also include a description (e.g., “Year 2022”).

    The type of emission defines the key (“co2e”, “co2”, “ch4”, “n2o”, “hfcs”, “pfcs”,
    “sf6”, “nf33”). Value, unit (e.g., “g”, “kg”, “t”) and base unit (e.g., “kWh”,
    “l”, “kg”, “km”) specify the emission details. A reference to the source of this
    information can be disclosed as hyperlink. The component may also have a **Consumer**
    when information about the energy efficiency is available (consider that emissions
    of food, for example, often are reported only per 1 kg produced). A consumer has
    a name (e.g., “Boeing 747”, “iPhone 14”), and optionally a description. It also
    includes 1 or more **Consumptions** (some consumers may support several energy
    sources, for example cars with combustion engine can be refueled with different
    types of gasoline; hybrid vehicles use gasoline and electricity) as key-value
    pairs. The type of energy defines the key (e.g., “electricity”, “gasoline”) and
    corresponds to the type of the source. Value, unit (e.g., “kWh”, “l”) and base
    unit (e.g., “km”, “h”, “d”) specify the consumption details. This information
    can be supplemented by a reference.

    data in real-time and observe the impact of changing different components, such
    as using alternative energy sources or reducing the quantity of a particular material,
    on the overall carbon footprint. Additionally, the application facilitates a side-by-side
    comparison of different scenarios, allowing users to evaluate how they differ.
    Another essential feature of the application is its ability to enable easy sharing
    of scenarios, promoting collaboration and knowledge-sharing to reduce carbon emissions.
