- en: A good piece of advice to use TensorFlow is to run it on a Graphics Processing
    Unit (GPU) or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) instead of a normal Central Processing
    Unit (CPU) accelerator. While simple models and calculations might still work
    using a CPU, you might notice that the full capability of TensorFlow can only
    be appreciated on graphical hardware.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    [Google Colaboratory (“Colab”)](https://colab.research.google.com/) which is somewhat
    like “*a* *free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely
    in the cloud*.” While this tutorial claims more about the simplicity and advantages
    of Colab, there are drawbacks as limited GPU hours and reduced computing power
    compared to proper cloud environments. However, I believe Colab might not be a
    bad service to make the first steps with TensorFlow.

    100% probability for the corresponding category in this case. This is important
    as TensorFlow will calculate the probability for each of the possible categories

    both to train the model and assess the progress using the validation loss and
    validation accuracy. You can vary the size of the accuracy data set but I used
