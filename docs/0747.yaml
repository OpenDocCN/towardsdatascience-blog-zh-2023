    changes over time, and derive useful insights to give a better steer on how to
    improve it over time. You will also see how I have used a simple concept of multiple
    regression to better understand how Fitbit derives this measure from speed, and
    heart rate, and the use of contour plots for further insight.

    of tracking your heart and lung health and introduce VO₂ Max.
