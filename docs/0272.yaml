    is both the things we already know and the way we went amount knowing them. The
    latter is called the scientific process. It is a systematic methodology for acquiring
    new knowledge. The most important part of that system is the hypothesis.

- en: A hypothesis is an educated assumption or guess about the way something works.
    For example, you may not be sleeping well. A good hypothesis is, “the double expressos
    I’m having just before bed are keeping me up”. This is a good hypothesis as it
    is both testable and supported by evidence.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, a hypothesis *must* be testable. This means we are able to design an
    experiment that will provide data. An analysis of this data will either support
    or oppose the hypothesis. Our hypothesis above is testable. You could simply stop
    drinking coffee before bed and observe how you sleep.

    can get closer and closer with more evidence from multiple independent experiments.
    To claim that coffee has a negative impact on sleep, we’d have to be a bit more
    rigorous than a once-off experiment. It would require multiple people, different
    levels of caffeine, double-blind tests, etc…

    other words, we need to explain the underlying relationships captured by the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    We start with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of features. After many iterations,
    we boil these down to the final set. It is only then do we come up with convincing
    business reasons for including these in the model. This is the opposite of hypothesis
    testing.

    That is ML researchers tend to create their own eco chamber. The goal of a study
    or even an entire community is to improve performance on a benchmark dataset.
    Diminishing improvements in performance are taken as scientific contributions
    and the original research question becomes a second thought.
  prefs: []

    at [predicting the outcome of legal cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10819) using
    ML and NLP techniques. This was to help the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
    improve the speed at which they could make judgements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this wouldn’t really have helped the ECHR. Would a judge even trust the outcome
    of a model?

    the privilege of rerunning tests, collecting new datasets or even testing a hypothesis
    in a completely new way. Industry doesn’t have this privilege. You need to make
    decisions now with whatever evidence you have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This leads to the question, *should* data science be more like science? Often
    the answer is no. It would be counterproductive to tackle all business problems
    with the same rigour as a scientific hypothesis. It is simply not possible to
    create multiple lines of evidence in the time required to make a decision.

    This can include trends in the data or what model features you expect to be important.
    These can be taken as informal hypotheses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your analysis will provide evidence for or against these expectations. If you
    find evidence to the contrary, you now cannot only give a convincing reason for
    an observed trend. You will also need to explain why the existing expectation
    was incorrect. This puts a heavier burden on your reasons making them more reliable.
  prefs: []

- en: Use multiple metrics and visualisations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When providing evidence, do not rely on one metric or visualisation as they
    all have their own limitations. Data scientists already do this. When assessing
    the performance of a model, we do not only look at accuracy. We use precision,
    recall or even visualise performance with ROC curves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same approach should be taken when doing analysis. For example, suppose
    we want to assess someone’s financial position. We could calculate their total
    income in the previous year. This would tell us a lot but one figure is not enough
    to fully capture their position. We would also have to look at expenses and existing
    debt. Along with totals, we could look at month-on-month changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is similar to providing many lines of evidence for a conclusion. Although
    this is not the same as collecting new data or rerunning experiments. We are still
    using one base dataset. All metrics will be impacted by biases in this dataset.
    We are simply removing the bias introduced by the metrics themselves.

  prefs:

    That is exactly what metrics we will use in the analysis and what values will
    be considered a success. This is to stop you from cherry-picking metrics that
    support a preexisting belief.

    different definitions of fairness. One definition, **equal opportunity**, works
    by comparing the false positive rates (FPR) of a privileged and unprivileged group.
    If the difference in FPRs is within some cutoff, the model is considered fair.

    argue for a higher cutoff after the difference in FPRs is calculated. If the difference
    is significant, we could even argue to use a different definition entirely. With
    months of modelling work on the line, this could be tempting.
