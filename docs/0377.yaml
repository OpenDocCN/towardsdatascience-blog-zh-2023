    these models through a generic interface is great for experimentation and creating
    social media posts, but it is not enough for professionals from different fields
    to do their job effectively. For that, we need these models in be woven into products

    fashion business, I attempted to use Stable Diffusion for fashion design. A generative
    AI product for fashion designers with no limits to creativity seemed like an obvious
    idea to me. Enthusiastic, I generated this image of a dress using Stable Diffusion
    and shared it with my fashion designer friend.

    format is not very useful to a fashion designer. For AI to actually deliver value,
    we need to think about how its output can be used in a practical way. This may
    involve preprocessing the model’s inputs, post-processing the outputs, or combining
    them with human-generated content. The key is leveraging the unique capabilities
    of AI to focus on solving specific real world problems for users. Let’s explore
    how to make this seemingly magical new technology work for my fashion designer

    2 broad approaches — vertical and horizontal. The **Vertical** approach involves
    building AI assisted software products for the creative process of a specific
    industry or niche. Some examples are fashion print design and furniture design.
    Each of these niches have different requirements and workflows that we have to
    keep in mind.
  prefs: []

- en: The **Horizontal** approach covers products meant for a function that is required
    across industries, such as graphic design, advertising design or legal contract
    drafting. Advertising creatives are needed across industries, from automobiles
    to food. Here, the product doesn’t need industry-specific tooling. What’s most
    important is a great user interface that allows a user to do graphic design work
    in a fraction of the time and with higher quality than before.

    texture is an image that can be placed next to itself — above, below, or side
    by side — without creating an obvious seam, join or boundary between the copies
    of the image. Here’s an example of a seamless texture I generated by tweaking
    the Stable Diffusion code. This image is composed of four generated images placed

- en: For AI models like Stable Diffusion, fine tuning the model on a dataset that
    is relevant to an industry will be critical. In the case of fashion print designs,
    a designer may want to generate patterns according to a particular style, color
    pallet or mood. Fine tuning the generative model using a few examples will help
    generate designs that are much more relevant. Fine tuning may be needed even for
    other deep learning models such as those for object recognition and segmentation
    where the objects in question are not present in the training data of the out-of-the-box
    pre-trained model. Eventually I expect that model fine tuning tools will be integrated
    into every product. There is probably a massive company waiting to be built that
    offers model fine tuning as an API service.

    AI research papers and the code for their implementation are often public. OpenAI
    released Dall-E and Dall-E 2 models for text to image generation, and soon after
    the open source Stable Diffusion model was released. AI has attracted some of
    the world’s best minds, and the industry is progressing rapidly. It guaranteed
    that someone will eventually release a new and better model than the one you have
    currently implemented.

    it is easier to create a defensible business moat. The convenience that the tooling

    the AI model output to state-of-the-art benchmarks.

    across industries, new AI based products face an uphill battle from incumbent
    giants. This is because products like Photoshop and other products are rapidly
    introducing features powered by AI. Professionals who rely on Photoshop’s extensive
    image editing tools will prefer to use AI features within Photoshop, rather than
    switch to another product. A lot of startups building horizontal AI products could
    be short lived because of existing giants with large distribution. If AI models
    are integrated into a tool that people already heavily use and pay for, they have
    little incentive to move to another one. Notion, a note taking app with 20 million
    users, recently introduced an AI writing assistant. New AI powered word processors
    may find it difficult to compete because of Notion’s existing large user base
    and network effect.

    the advanced tooling of Photoshop. Canva found its niche for non-designers by
    building a simple product with templates and stock content that allowed them to
    create good content quickly and cheaply. AI feels like a Canva moment all over
    again, but for every creative field and on a much larger scale. Generative AI
    models like GPT3 and Stable Diffusion are especially relevant because non-designer
    users do not have to start from zero. Instead, with just a text prompt they get
    a starting point that is way ahead of what they could have ever created.

    because of the highly competitive landscape and the amount of money flowing into

    a definitive answer to is how this will impact human jobs? It is an incredibly
    difficult question with no single answer. However I am certain that the answer
    does not lie at either extremes of AI replacing humans completely vs the human
    mind being irreplaceable. A conclusive answer that will stand the test of time
