    or Science, `pandas`is (likely) one of the first libraries that you will have
    to learn about. This incredible library enables you to manipulate two very important
    objects in the Python language — the 1 dimensional `Series` and the two dimensional
    `DataFrame`. These objects are part of a lot of data pipelines and mastering them
    is crucial to start your Pytyon career.

    the creation of multidimensional and multi-type objects. The goal of this post
    is to provide a very complete guide on how to use some famous `pandas` functions
    and how to work with the most important features of the library. Hopefully, after
    reading this guide, you will be ready to work with the most important `pandas`
    eatures. It may also be very common that you are migrating from a SQL background,
    so I’ll try to leave a comparison with SQL code throughout some instructions in
    the post, so that it is easier to compare the instructions between the two frameworks.
    But, keep in mind that knowing SQL is definitely not a requirement to learn `pandas`
    !
