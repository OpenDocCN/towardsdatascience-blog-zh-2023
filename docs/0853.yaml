    here: [Hidden Patterns in Street Names: a Data Science Story [Part 1]](/hidden-patterns-in-street-names-a-data-science-story-part-1-82c8dd130693)).
    In the first part, we looked into overall gender distributions and how they changed
    based on neighborhood and road type. For this follow-up post, I will be focusing
    on occupations and the historical period these figures lived in. Let’s get started!'

    dates and their occupations, I hand-labeled part of the data set obtained from
    OpenStreetMaps ([licensing: CC BY-SA 2.0](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)).
    Specifically, I used the primary occupation listed for a particular historical
    figure in Wikipedia and relied on the birth/death dates listed there to add these
    details into the data. In total, I labeled **643** unique streets divided into
    segments throughout the data, of which a significant proportion had no information
    online (more on that at the end).'

    data. Artists follow suit, rounding out the rest of the top 10\. I made the choice
    to label partisan figures (8% of labelled total) separately from the rest of fighters,
    because of their direct associations with the period of the Communist regime in
    Albania (1946–1991) and the propaganda they were made a part of during this time.
    Therefore, I believe this deserves its own consideration as part of a broader
    conversation on how we reckon with our history as a country.'

    in the period between the **1850s** to **1930s**. This seems to be less of the
    case for writers, which are represented in the 17th and 18th centuries as well.
    There is also a peak in the “Fighter” birth and death years, corresponding to
    the Skanderbeg-led period of rebellion during the Ottoman Empire invasion. Skanderbeg
    (1405–1468) is recognized as our National Hero and is widely honored in many monuments,
    squares and institutions to this day. The 19th-20th century, on the other hand,
    corresponds to the period of the Albanian National Awakening which was a cultural
    and political movement seeking to establish an independent country of Albania.'

    instead of the mean because it would have been greatly influenced by the small
    spike around the 1400s. This results in a shift in time of the era of women’s
    activity, compared to the overall distributions. In part 1, we saw that many of
    these women were in the arts or had fought in various wars, which can explain
    the median death year.'

    locally important figures but perhaps not widely recognized, or the (obvious)
    fact that the internet has a limited amount of information and one would need
    to look into other sources. Here is a visualization of where all of these names
    were located (note how these names feature in the periphery, rather than in the
    more urban core of the city):'

    lens. We delved deeper into how different work areas and historical periods were
    represented and uncovered patterns across both these aspects. In addition, there’s
    a few other directions to take this project: some questions that come to mind
    are how the names have changed over the years as the city has grown and changed,
    or even what specifics to the naming process lead to the distributions we saw.
