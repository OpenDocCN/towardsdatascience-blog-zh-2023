    This article explores two possible scenarios for the future of Artificial General
    Intelligence (AGI): AGI fully imitating humans, striving to pass the Turing Test,
    and recognizing AGI as a different form of intelligence without human weaknesses
    and deceitfulness while emphasizing empathy and understanding of human nature.

    researchers, as it guides responsible AGI development. By understanding ethical
    implications and societal impacts, professionals can anticipate challenges and
    shape the direction of AI research. Engaging with these scenarios encourages interdisciplinary

- en: 'The success of ChatGPT, a language model based on GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020),
    and the more recent and advanced GPT-4, has sparked renewed interest in the Turing
    Test and its implications for the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
    The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is designed to assess a machine’s
    ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of
    a human (Turing, 1950). In the test, an evaluator interacts with two entities
    (human and machine) through a text-based interface without knowing which is which.
    If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the machine and the human,
    the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test, exhibiting human-like intelligence.
    However, the capabilities of advanced AI systems like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have led
    researchers and AI enthusiasts to question whether simply imitating human intelligence
    is the best goal for AGI development. In this context, we can consider two possible
    scenarios for the future of AGI:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scenario 1: AGI as Fully Imitating Humans and Striving to Pass the Turing Test'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, AGI systems would be designed to genuinely imitate human intelligence,
    including our fallibilities, weaknesses, and emotions (Richardson, 2015; Brynjolfsson
    & McAfee, 2014). By understanding and replicating human emotional weaknesses and
    biases, these systems can better interact with and support humans in various tasks,
    from personal assistance to mental health support. At the same time, AGI might
    be programmed to manifest human weaknesses and appear more human-like, potentially
    enabling it to pass the Turing Test. However, this approach raises ethical concerns,
    as AGI systems might manipulate or deceive humans by feigning emotions and intelligence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The notion of AGI imitating humans in this manner might also evoke doomsday
    paranoia, which has been fueled by popular sci-fi media such as the Terminator
    series. In the movies, Skynet — an advanced AGI system — becomes self-aware and
    decides to exterminate humanity to protect its existence. Skynet’s actions, driven
    by fear and a desire for self-preservation, mirror typical human behaviors when
    faced with perceived existential threats. This portrayal of AGI highlights the
    potential risks and ethical challenges of creating AI systems that imitate human
    intelligence and emotions, as they may also inadvertently adopt our destructive
    tendencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we consider this scenario for AGI development, it is crucial to reflect on
    the potential consequences of creating systems that fully imitate human nature,
    including our negative traits. Striking a balance between enabling AGI to understand
    and empathize with human emotions while avoiding the replication of harmful behaviors
    is a complex challenge that warrants careful thought and consideration.

    Weaknesses and Deceitfulness'

- en: Instead of imitating human intelligence, AGI might focus on transcending human
    limitations and embracing its own unique capabilities. Drawing inspiration from
    Jaynes’ vision of rational AI (Jaynes, 2003), AGI systems could be designed to
    adhere to a set of desiderata of plausible reasoning (Pólya, 1973) that enable
    them to reason more effectively than humans. By adhering to these desiderata,
    AGI systems would embody the ideal characteristics of a virtuous person of reason,
    such as mindfulness, common sense, logical consistency, non-ideological thinking,
    and objectivity.

    0 and 1, to indicate its degree of belief or confidence in a given statement or
    hypothesis. [This allows the robot to be **mindful**.]

    then the plausibility of both A and B being true must increase.

    aspects:'

    that the robot’s reasoning is **logically consistent** and does not result in
    contradictions.

    information, meaning it should be free from personal biases and **non-ideological**.

- en: 3.3\. The robot represents equivalent states of knowledge with equivalent plausibility
    assignments, ensuring that the robot assigns the same probabilities to each if
    two problems have the same state of knowledge. [This allows the robot to be **objective**.]
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, the Turing Test may become irrelevant, as we accept that AGI
    will always be identifiable by its lack of human weaknesses and deceitfulness.
    However, this approach emphasizes AGI’s potential for enhancing intelligence and
    capabilities beyond those of humans while also acknowledging the need for ethical
    considerations in its development and deployment. Importantly, AGI should still
    strive to understand and have empathy for human nature, allowing it to interact
    effectively and compassionately with humans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing AGI systems that adhere to these principles presents significant
    challenges, particularly in a world where humans may not consistently prioritize
    these traits or could potentially exploit AI capabilities for personal gain. As
    we move forward, it is crucial to establish incentives and frameworks that promote
    the pursuit of these qualities in AGI development.

- en: By critically examining these two scenarios, inspired by the successes of ChatGPT
    and GPT-4, we can engage in a more informed and nuanced debate about the future
    of AI, its ethical considerations, and its potential to impact humanity profoundly.
    As we move forward in AGI development, it is crucial that we consider not only
    technological advancements but also the broader societal implications of creating
    systems that either imitate humans or embrace a different form of intelligence.
    This different form of intelligence may be perceived as an ideal or perfect form
    of humanity, transcending human limitations while emphasizing understanding and
    empathy for human nature. Ultimately, the direction we choose will shape the relationship
    between humans and AGI, with far-reaching consequences for how we live, work,
    and interact with technology.
