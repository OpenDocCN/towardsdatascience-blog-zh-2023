    Your first few weeks flew by with company onboarding and before you realized it,
    a few years had passed. You worked on countless projects, both individually and
    as part of a team, and your solutions are making a positive impact on the company.

    But how do you bridge the gap? What are some of the things that a senior data
    scientist needs to know? And most importantly: how do you transform your junior-level
    data science code into senior-level data science code?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, this last question is the easiest to answer and is the easiest skill
    to improve on your path toward becoming a senior data scientist. I’ve singled
    out the top four areas where your junior-level code can be transformed into something
    that would encourage any company to promote you to a senior data scientist position.
    The key is to master the fundamentals, ditch the spaghetti code, begin implementing
    testing and QA skills, and learn to optimize your code.

    data scientist-level code you will need to master the fundamentals of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the beginning of your data science journey, it’s an accomplishment to simply
    write code that runs properly. Now, however, is the time to begin mastering those
    fundamentals so that it’s no longer a surprise when your code runs properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the one tip that you can’t speed up, and that will just be achieved
    by spending time doing the work. Over your first few years as a junior data scientist,
    you’ll be given opportunities every day to work on mastering the fundamentals
    of data science code, from programming fundamentals to algorithms, to data structures,
    and to design patterns.

- en: Furthermore, now is the time to deepen your knowledge base by learning other
    programming languages (likely the ones that your company uses or those that you
    have time to learn on your own for fun) and other technologies that can improve
    your quality of work (i.e., Notion for organizing your projects, Git for version
    control, code syntax-checking extensions in your code editor, etc.). Some of these
    languages and tools will stick, while others will simply provide insightful lessons
    that will make you a better data scientist even if you never use them again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now is also the time to stretch your capabilities and begin exploring even more
    intense concepts in data science. For example, you may be in more of a data analyst
    position where you’re explaining the causes of past events. However, your boss
    is now wanting you to move into the predictive side of things which requires you
    to begin learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Pushing
    yourself to learn these topics will allow you to move into more senior and supervisory
    roles, where you can begin passing on your knowledge to new junior data scientists
    who are starting out just like you did.

    that data scientists write terrible code. The spaghetti code is real, especially
    when you’re starting out. This may be permissible for the first couple of years
    that you’re working as a junior data scientist, but as your experience increases,
    it becomes less and less acceptable to write messy code.

    scientist position is your ability to write clean, maintainable, and readable
    code. Not only does this make you easy to work with and immensely professional,
    but it also shows that you can pass on these techniques to future junior data
    scientists under your tutelage.

    to focus on making your code clean, maintainable, and readable at all times.

    you begin formatting your code more professionally. Code cleanliness, maintainability,
    and readability are the cornerstones of a data scientist who is a pleasure to
    work with, which is why these standards should be emblazoned on your brain (or
    at the very least, have a prominent place on your desk within easy reach). Best
    practices and style are two things that should always be considered and reviewed
    heavily before pushing your final commit or sending your code to the software
    engineering department for translation into production-ready code.

    coding principles (at the very least) and [SOLID](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/)
    coding principles (at the more advanced), to ensure that you’re writing the best
    code possible. While these principles may not be relevant if you’re primarily
    writing code that will never be touched by anyone else or that will only be run
    on a small set of internal machines, it’s not a bad idea to become proficient
    in these principles if you ever change jobs or begin producing production-level
    code.

    industry/company code standards. Each code commit you push to the repository should
    be a gleaming example of what your industry or company is looking for, and should
    be something that could be printed off and used in a training manual. Yes, it
    will take extra time for you, but the extra bit of thoughtfulness will pay dividends
    when it comes time for your company to promote internally. What’s one thing they’ll
    look for? An employee that consistently writes clean, maintainable, and readable
    code — and that should be you!

    frameworks is a great way to immediately take your code to the next level. While
    these are all skills you should be aware of as a junior data scientist, they’re
    skills you should be proficient in as a senior data scientist.

- en: Testing and QA skills are where you can begin to write excellent code that works
    as it was designed and that can work in tandem with other pieces of code. Where
    before you may have just sent your code off to the software engineering department
    where they would get everything ready for integration, you are now going to be
    writing code like a senior data scientist and must ensure that your code functions
    properly and can be integrated into larger code bases.

- en: While your company may have specific unit and integration tests they want you
    to run, it’s not a bad idea to begin building your own to ensure that your code
    is running and integrating the way you should. Your own forms of quality assurance
    are great ways to take responsibility for your own code and to ensure that if
    your code can pass your own tests, it can pass your company’s tests with no issues.
    Not only does this make you a better data scientist in the long run, but it allows
    you to become more efficient when writing code in the first place.
