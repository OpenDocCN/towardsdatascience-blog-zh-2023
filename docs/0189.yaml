- en: I first discovered machine learning in 2012 during my master’s degree in Electrical
    and Electronic Engineering through conversations with professors and colleagues
    in our research lab. I was fascinated by what I learned and decided to take online
    courses that included the popular Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller material on coursera.org.
    Andrew’s machine learning course stood out as the most engaging, practical, and
    enjoyable. This opened up a new and exciting world of endless possibilities for
    X to Y mappings.

- en: I was left with more questions after taking the online courses and wondered
    if this is how the mind actually functions, if there’s a universal learning algorithm
    that can achieve human-like intelligence, what learning and inference truly are,
    and how they can be expressed mathematically. I was also interested in the inspiration
    behind the creation of these algorithms and their potential to be exploited psychologically.
    To gain more insight, I read books and research papers by authors such as Jeff
    Hawkins, Geoffrey Hinton, Daniel Kahneman, Dan Ariely, V. S. Ramachandran, Claude
    Shannon, Pedro Domingos, Steven Pinker, and Ian Goodfellow.

    more specifically Neural networks but, after extensive discussions with my supervisor
    and much consideration, I decided to shift my focus to Bayesian methods during
    the peak of the Deep learning trend. This shift in focus changed my course from
    weights, neurons and activation functions to **uncertainty**. And much of it!
    I read more books and research papers by authors such as David Barber, Kevin Murphy,
    Christopher Bishop, Tom Minka, John Winn, Judea Pearl, Norman Fenton, David MacKay,
    Daphne Koller, and Edwin Thompson Jaynes. I’m still finding this field intellectually
    stimulating as it requires a different way of thinking compared to other machine
    learning approaches—often leading to introspection.

    to practice data science and implement machine learning algorithms across various
    industries: electricity utility, digital and social media, fintech, and mobile
    telecommunications. My aim has always been to achieve more with less and to share
    the learnings. Some of the most impactful algorithms I’ve applied (and variations
    thereof) include PCA, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Gaussian Mixture Models,
    Gaussian Process, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and simple Neural Networks (sequential
    and feed-forward). The versatility and broad applicability of the Gaussian distribution
    for unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised tasks continues to impress me.'

    problems, partly due to the physics that underlie the data generation processes.
    Analysing and interpreting human behaviour from data or metadata was complex,
    outside of my expertise, and Apophenia a “tool” that I was not comfortable using.

- en: During my time working at digital and social media companies, I found Deep learning
    to be highly applicable, largely due to the reasons outlined in Chapter 11 of
    Ian Goodfellow’s book on Deep learning. From my experience, this was a “safe and
    effective” form of data science, particularly for text and image problems. There
    are plenty of tools, example code, online courses, and research papers available,
    and apart from the tedious process of data preparation, it was often like choosing
    from a candy store before going to the movies. However, I had to be familiar with
    the underlying theory of the tools I was using, especially when pre-built solutions
    were not sufficient. Nando de Freitas once compared it to playing with Lego, which
    is an accurate analogy and the most valuable take-away from my experience with
    Deep learning. Breaking complex problems down into smaller, manageable parts,
    an age-old wisdom.

- en: In all of the industries where I worked, I found Bayesian modelling to be appropriate
    for a wider range of problems compared to other methods. These problems often
    involved limited data, missing data, the need to incorporate domain knowledge,
    the need for custom models, the need to incorporate uncertainty, and the need
    for probabilistic and causal interpretation. However, it was not always easy to
    convince management to invest in such methods. Barriers to adoption included a
    lack of specialized skills, limited relevant online resources, and longer model
    development times. Developing Bayesian models meant burning the midnight oil.
    Despite these challenges, I managed to make Bayesian modelling work for some problems,
    but for most I had to keep a straight face while “panel beating” the data. Things
    changed once I discovered Infer.NET, a framework for developing bespoke Bayesian
    models (open-sourced in 2018). It took a lot of effort to get familiar with the
    framework, but it was well worth it!

- en: The field of Bayesian modelling is intellectually satisfying as it frequently
    uncovers hidden shortcomings in our own reasoning and perceptions, which is surprising
    considering the basic principles (and philosophy) at its core. The results obtained
    can often be counter-intuitive, unexpected, and have a significant impact. It’s
    also intriguing to note that many widely-used machine learning algorithms can
    be understood as special cases derived from a more general Bayesian perspective.
    Why limit oneself when one can have it all (approximately)?

- en: Over the past decade, I observed many advancements in technology driven by the
    contributions of AI researchers and open-source communities, as well as the support
    provided by the industry in terms of infrastructure. This has made model development
    and data management faster, cheaper, and more accessible, which in turn has made
    it possible to label more data and train models with high computational costs
    almost “instantly”. While many of us were focused on joining Pandas dataframes,
    organizations like OpenAI, DeepMind, and others created ground-breaking text-to-image,
    text-to-video, and language models that have become widely used. Who knows the
    limits of ChatGPT yet? Additionally, it’s worth mentioning the impressive accuracy
    achieved by AlphaFold and the historic (bittersweet) AlphaGo championship. Makes
    me wonder which field of study will ultimately provide the most accurate understanding
    of human intelligence and consciousness.

    I once overheard a recruiter asking “How big should the candidate be?” This comment,
    though figurative, highlights the lack of a clear definition and ongoing evolution
    of responsibilities and overlap of these emerging roles. This has made hiring
    and applying for these positions challenging. The Drew Conway Venn diagram, which
    was widely popular, currently appears to be a fitting depiction of the complexity
    of the data science role. However, I still believe that the Ouroboros would be
    a more apt representation, as it symbolizes the cyclical and self-referential
    nature of the field.

    but in my experience effective leaders overseeing such initiatives were scares.
    To develop a strong support structure and business model for data science projects
    requires a deep understanding of the various components involved, including balancing
    the needs of the business with the latest technology trends. From what I have
    observed, the most successful leaders in this field had a practical approach and
    were well-versed in both the industry and the science. Success in data science
    projects often depended on the ability to balance project intent, necessary skills,
    subject matter expertise, and systems and data. Unfortunately, those who were
    overly ambitious or overly focused on the latest technology trends often struggled,
    while those who lived by principles such as Occam’s Razor and Gall’s Law tended
    to be more successful, often with a bit of luck as well!

- en: Seeing the financial impact that a model or solution developed by yourself or
    by others can make on an organization is a truly satisfying experience. One approach
    that has worked for me in achieving this is to start small and allow for enough
    time for development and refinement cycles while keeping the end-to-end product
    in mind throughout the process. This includes keeping well documented findings,
    presenting information in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, seeking feedback
    from peers, actively collaborating with subject matter experts across different
    business units, approaching the problem from different perspectives, experimenting
    with different techniques, asking many questions, and carefully listening to user
    feedback. The process of developing a prototype and bringing it to production
    is a challenge in itself, but it’s important to remember that even the best solution
    will be of little use if people don’t understand how to use it. Something not
    easily resolved without making compromises.

    general intelligence, to the development of systems that are able to perform well
    on specific tasks and maintain a high degree of accuracy in handling edge cases,
    making them more practical and reliable for human consumption. I think we’ll see
    more realistic valuation of AI companies, more focus on enterprise level data
    as a product, more focus on A/B testing using the Bayesian methodology, the integration
    of blockchain technology to allow customers to monetise their data, and more advancements
    with multi-modal models.

    modelling (causal modelling in particular) practical and attractive to students,
    researchers, scientists, and industry practitioners. An “Andrew Ng style Bayesian
    inference course” if you will. I stress this point especially after what happened
    during the 2020–2022 period, which appears to be the biggest biological misstep
    in humanity. It seems that many Covid studies are plagued by statistical fallacies
    such as Simpson’s Paradox and Berkson’s Paradox, and other statistical manipulation
    that influenced the Covid narrative (see examples [here](https://www.normanfenton.com/)).
    It’s quite frustrating to see this happening, especially when the proper use of
    statistics and probability are crucial to understanding and addressing a pandemic.
    I mean “How dare you?”.

    I hope to see more support provided by organisations for professional development
    in the field. I guess one way to tackle this would be to encourage more collaboration

    skilled professionals.
