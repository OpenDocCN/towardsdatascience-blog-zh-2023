    of exploratory data analysis, but also saw how sometimes getting our hands dirty
    is necessary if we want to understand certain elements of our data in greater
    detail.

- en: Next time round, I would perhaps focus on doing some light preprocessing before
    running the profiling, as the report ended up treating the date field as a string
    rather than a date-time. A case of mistaken identity — thematically consistent.

    with wider, high-dimensional data frames: more summaries, interactions and correlation
    calculations would surely come with a computational price; larger correlation
    visuals might make interpretation more difficult.'

    a heat map and plotting the results of our various OPTICS clustering runs.

- en: Although I didn’t demonstrate it here, Folium can also create and visualise
    clusters with very little effort. If I was going to take another run at this analysis
    — or something similar — taking advantage of this functionality *before* doing
    a more formal clustering exercise might be advantageous.

- en: Although I didn’t show it explicitly, I filtered out all sightings with a missing
    latitude or missing longitude. Without doing any analysis on the missingness in
    the coordinate pairs I can’t be sure if this introduced any bias, something we’d
    need to check if we were doing this analysis in anger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This actually me leads on to quite an important nuance in the data — the accuracy
    of coordinate pairs. I would imagine that getting an exact GPS reading when you’ve
    just spotted a Bigfoot could be challenging, and so many of the latitude and longitude
    readings would be best estimates with reference to a landmark. There is likely
    little we *could* do to correct this, as any form of intervention would likely
    lead to an introduction of bias. *This form of location “inaccuracy” is actually
    more common than you might imagine — e.g. the location of a road traffic accident
    might be taken from the nearest safe place.*

- en: Now it’s pretty clear that the clustering needs some refinement, not least because
    some of the cluster centroids landed up in quite urbanised areas. Not only would
    we want to vary the `min_cluster_size` in OPTICS, but we’d also want some control
    over the cluster area if we wanted to arrive at some “searchable” zones. I’m not
    aware of any parameters in the OPTICS algorithm which allows us to control cluster
    area so we we’d need to introduce some form of post-processing — something similar
    is covered in the article I linked to above.

    creature, please take it in the spirit in which I wrote it — a fun bit of analysis.
    Do I think that Bigfoot exists and is prowling around somewhere? No. Do I think
    it would be amazing if scientists did in fact find a new species of animal out
    there? Yes. Go science!*'
