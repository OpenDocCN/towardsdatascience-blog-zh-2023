- en: Visualisation is one of the critical tasks we use to understand well log data
    and the subsurface. This includes viewing data on well log plots, scatter plots
    and histograms. By doing this, we can gain a solid understanding of our data.
    However, working with 2D plots is sometimes not enough and we need that extra
    dimension by going to 3D.

    is to visualise the path of a well.

- en: In the early days of oil and gas exploration, wells were drilled vertically
    into the subsurface. However, as technology advanced, the industry shifted from
    vertical to horizontal drilling and eventually to drilling complex well paths
    facilitated by using the innovation of geosteering.

- en: This evolution in well path geometry underscores the importance of visualising
    well paths in three dimensions. Doing so allows us to gain a better understanding
    of how wells have penetrated the geological layers, and to plan future wells to
    avoid collisions or issues.

    records the position of a well, and display it using a 3D line plot from Plotly
    Express.
