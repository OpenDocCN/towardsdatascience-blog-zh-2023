    and was asked about how to setup a unit tests? If you have no idea of what I am
    talking about or just want to refresh the basics of unit test, then this post
    is for you.

- en: Unit testing is an essential part of any software development process, and it
    is especially important for machine learning models. A unit test is a software
    testing method in which individual units or components of a software application
    are tested in **isolation**. In the context of machine learning, unit tests are
    used to ensure that individual components of your model, such as a feature preprocessing
    or a model evaluation metric, are working as intended.

    caught early on are typically easier and quicker to fix than bugs that are discovered
    later on. Also, unit tests can help you ensure that a machine learning model is
    robust and…
