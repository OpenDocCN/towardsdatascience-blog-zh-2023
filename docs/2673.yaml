    reflecting the reality that it’s about more than just data and that many former
    academics work in the field. I find that “applied science” has different expectations
    than research science. So I wrote up what, in my experience, helps produce great
    applied science work. I use this as a “definition of done” for data science work,
    but many points will also benefit analysts, engineers, and other technical roles.

    clever uses of data and models. Sometimes, the first step to this is discovering
    the most impactful business problem which is likely to afford feasible scientific
    solutions; sometimes, the business problem is well-understood, and scientific
    work begins at the formulation of a well-defined technical problem statement.
  prefs: []

    problem. Scientists need to understand complex business challenges well enough
    to translate them into technical formulations that can be solved in finite time.
    They cut through ambiguity and create appropriate structural assumptions to enable
    solutions.

    need to work well in teams.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of science work requires collaborating with others; understanding previous
    work, finding relevant datasets, asking for explanations, communicating progress
    to your stakeholders, convincing your teammates to support your project. Ultimately
    you are responsible for delivering a result — managing the collaboration is part
    of the job. This may mean that you need to convince a teammate to review your
    Pull Request, and it may mean that you need to find a way to prioritize your data
    engineering needs into another team’s backlog. When this process gets stuck, you
    can escalate and your lead can help clarify priorities — but you are responsible
    for doing this.

    one-on-one. These sessions can be extremely valuable and help to produce much
    higher quality work than any one individual could do on their own. But if the
    brainstorming sessions are not directly connected to follow-up work, they are
    often a waste of time. You’ll want to avoid the latter — that means following
    up pro-actively on discussed ideas and tasks: if the team agreed that something
    should be done, do it (and communicate results). If it’s too much to be done immediately,
    write a ticket for the ideas (and communicate the ticket). It is often very helpful
    in brainstorming sessions to proactively ask what the concrete take-aways are,
    and who is responsible for next steps — and anyone can do this, and share their
    notes with the team.'

    over again, what would we do differently?'

    a conversation, or a ticket. It is problematic, however, to “nod along” — when
    others assume you have understood something that you didn’t, this will likely

    should be our favorite question: when something is unclear, keep asking until
    you feel there is mutual understanding. If in doubt, rephrasing something in your
    own words is a powerful tool to check you really understood the right thing.'

    science: concepts aren’t well-defined, quantities aren’t measurable, stakeholder

    sophistication can later save this.'

    some base assumptions: we need to choose a specific definition of a certain concept,
    we ignore edge cases, we need to decide what potential side-effects are out-of-scope.
    Take note of these assumptions so that you can revisit them later.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result of making assumptions, you may end up solving the wrong problem,
    because a plausible assumption turned out to be inaccurate. The most effective
    way to prevent this is to work incrementally and to frequently verify that increments
    are moving in the right direction. Taking this to an extreme, building a mockup
    solution (e.g. a quick spreadsheet) can often help generate valuable business
    feedback.

    or unconsciously follow a clear structure of hypotheses in their work, breaking
    an ambiguous problem into sequentially solvable sub-problems. I recommend writing
    a full draft of the hypothesis structure, and getting feedback on it, before writing
    the first line of code.

    for what to try first, and what to do when an idea works (follow that branch)
    and when it doesn’t (continue work on the next branch below the current one).
    The “leaves” of your tree should ideally be relatively easy-to-test, answerable-by-data
    questions. The structure of your plan should also make it easier to describe progress,
    and to get feedback on interim results.

    work” — it is often more accurate to say that these people know what not to try
    out, and that they spend the majority of their time on productive ideas in the
    first place. Of course, building this level of intuition is difficult and a life-long
    career. Good intuition means you spend most of your time on productive hypotheses
    — this is important because the universe of potential hypotheses and ideas to
    follow is massive, and intuition reduces the search space in your hypothesis tree.'

    when it gets to details. To make this more concrete: when dealing with image or
    text data, the idea of using “embeddings” is a good intuition that allows you
