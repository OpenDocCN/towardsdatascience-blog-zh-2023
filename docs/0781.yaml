    it is pertinent to reflect on the factors that contributed to the success of some
    initiatives during the peak of the hype cycle. It is worth considering what was
    instrumental in surpassing the mostly unrealistic expectations set during this
    period. However, the question at hand may be better framed as “who?” rather than
    “what?”. In this post, I share my observations and thoughts on what I think makes
    an **exceptional** data scientist — those that kept impressing and demonstrating
    business impact with their all-round skill and endless passion.

- en: An exceptional data scientist will demonstrate a deep sense of curiosity and
    a keen drive for ongoing learning. In my experience, most data scientists are
    faced with problems that require novel solutions that are not the run-of-the-mill
    supervised or unsupervised methods. Solutions for such problems require active
    research on topics not always directly relevant to the problem at hand, exploring
    online resources, keeping up-to-date with the latest from the open-source communities,
    reading books, engaging in conversations with peers, or attending data science
    meetups where they get to externalise ideas. This type of individual may also
    contribute to the field by developing tools or algorithms (although not necessarily
    enrolled in a postgraduate degree). They will also engage with academia to keep
    up-to-date with research and substantiate their own learning, which is an invaluable
    resource in my opinion.

    it to their ongoing projects or those of their peers. Furthermore, they exhibit
    an open-minded attitude and remain receptive to new ideas and perspectives, and
    possess a willingness to evaluate and challenge their own assumptions as they
    continue to learn and expand their skills. Such individuals exhibit a high degree
    of self-efficacy, which enables them to be highly motivated to learn and persevere.
    I’ve spoken to exceptional data scientists that also practice meta-cognition.
    They will reflect on their own cognitive processes and learning methods, which
    is highly beneficial in regulating and directing their own thoughts and knowledge
    towards a specific purpose. In my view, this contributes towards enhancing their
    learning efficacy and their ability to problem-solve more effectively.
  prefs: []

- en: How I would recognise such individuals is by looking at their public repositories
    where they implemented difficult theoretical concepts or algorithms derived from
    scientific papers. How did they approach the problem at hand? What literature
    and resources did they refer to? How did they ultimately develop a viable solution?
    Such insights can provide a useful understanding of their thinking process and
    approach towards problem-solving. I would also look out for those data scientists
    that use the learning-by-teaching method where teaching others help reinforce
    their own understanding and knowledge on the subject matter. This type of candidate
    is highly beneficial for a team, since they are open to share their learnings!
    As part of my interview process, I ask candidates about the methods or algorithms
    that they would like to learn (or better understand) and why. What is on their
    wish-list?

- en: Exceptional data scientists have a vocabulary and communication style that allows
    them to clearly articulate both business and technical information, taking into
    account the needs and perspectives of their audience*.* They may use active listening
    skills such as restating or summarising what a speaker has said and ask follow-up
    questions. They are able to put themselves in their audience’s shoes demonstrating
    empathy. This is often necessary when data scientists need to explain difficult
    concepts to non-technical business stakeholders. They also have belief in their
    own ability, but also able to convey confidently where they have uncertainties.
    They can keep an audience engaged during presentations and use storytelling to
    make their message memorable and impactful. They are great collaborators with
    product owners, business stakeholders and peers and are aware of group dynamics,
    which is crucial in recognising potential obstacles and opportunities for group
    success. They exhibit trust in others and are adept at building robust working
    relationships, maintaining a high level of interdependence within the group and
    resolving conflict in a positive and constructive manner. This also enhances group
    cohesion and facilitates successful outcomes.

    enables them to solve novel problems, think abstractly, and adapt to new situations.
    This facilitates their inventiveness and grasp of new concepts, often leading
    to the generation of new business ideas (an entrepreneurial mindset if you will)
    that can be transformed into new practical products or solutions. Some may display
    divergent thinking, capable of generating a wide range of ideas in response to
    a challenge or problem, which involves thinking beyond conventional approaches,
    making novel connections and considering multiple perspectives. They are imaginative,
    curious, and open to new experiences.

    when asking them to come up with different approaches to a problem. The focus
    here is not necessarily for the candidate to come up with correct solutions, but
    rather to assess their capacity for original thinking by connecting seemingly
    unrelated concepts to generate meaningful associations relevant to solving the
    problem.

    expertise in a particular field or industry that is pertinent to your recruitment
    objectives. Distinguished data scientists may have a good understanding of business
    (e.g., business strategy, objectives, etc.), which help them identify and work
    autonomously on core problems related to business. The same goes for other fields
    (e.g., engineering, manufacturing, finance, etc.). These data scientists have
    an advantage in using their domain knowledge in understanding the nuances of the
    data they are working with and to develop models or insights that are relevant
    and actionable. They would also know what model assumptions represent the underlying
    dynamics of the domain best, which can be gauged during interviews. Hiring domain
    professionals can accelerate data science initiatives in a particular domain.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    logic, principles and assumptions mathematically, using coherent arguments and
    evidence to support their position. The exceptional data scientist can explain
    their tools and identify the ideal scenarios to leverage them.'
  prefs: []

    the larger end-to-end system in which they are embedding a solution. They meticulously
    analyse the inter-relationships among various data and model components of a system,
    taking into account how these components are being consumed or interacted with.
    They also consider the impact of changes in one part of the system on the system
    as a whole and are interested in understanding the underlying structure and feedback
    loops that give rise to system behaviour. I’ve also observed exceptional data
    scientists working closely with end-users of the system to leverage user-experience
    feedback.'
  prefs: []

- en: '**Metrics driven:** They place a strong emphasis on using data and quantitative
    measures (appropriate statistics) to drive decision-making and to evaluate performance.
    They are focused on tracking and analysing KPIs and using that information to
    make informed decisions to improve models or systems. For example, they will know
    exactly what metrics to use for specific models, how to interpret them, and what
    cognitive biases and statistical biases (e.g., Goodhart’s law, Simpson’s paradox,
    Berkson’s paradox, etc.) to be aware of.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data orientated:** They are highly focused on the collection, analysis, and
    interpretation of data in order to inform decision-making and gain insights into
    various phenomena. The individual is comfortable working with data, is skilled
    in data processing, data analysis, and data visualisation. They are detail-oriented
    in their data exploration process and will search for explanations for anomalous
    discoveries — never sweeping hidden knowledge under the carpet.'

    or repositories where they and other contributors frequently contribute. This
    individual actively contributes code towards a common goal and their contributions

    do not prefer assigning time limit coding tasks to data science candidates. Doing
    so, undermines almost everything written in this post. Instead, I would review
    their public code repositories to assess their coding style, contributions, and
    problem-solving approaches. By examining the comments within their code and analysis,
    one can gauge their thought process and observations. Follow-up questions during
    interviews related to their public code can help clarify gaps. Alternatively,
    asking a data science candidate to talk through an interesting project they did
    (with the protection of confidential information), or providing them with a predetermined
    case study to solve conceptually (not with code) should provide ample opportunity
    for a hiring team to identify most of the characteristics mentioned in this post.

    your company/team culture is like, what complimentary skills your team requires,
    **and how you will retain and grow the exceptional data scientists after you’ve
