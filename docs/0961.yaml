- en: Multi-objective optimization is a critical area of research that has wide-ranging
    applications in various fields, including engineering, finance, and biology. It
    involves optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, where the objectives may
    be conflicting, and it is not possible to improve one objective without compromising
    the other. In recent years, many new methods have been developed to solve multi-objective
    optimization problems. In this blog post, we introduce a new method called “rake
    selection,” which is designed to efficiently solve multi-objective optimization
    problems.

- en: Genetic algorithms (GAs) are well-suited for multiobjective optimization, as
    they operate based on a population of solutions rather than a single solution.
    This feature allows them to explore a larger search space and capture a diverse
    set of solutions that can cover a wide range of objectives.

- en: In a typical GA, a population of potential solutions is generated and evaluated
    for their fitness based on multiple objectives. The fittest individuals are then
    selected to breed and produce a new generation of solutions, which undergo further
    selection and breeding until a satisfactory solution is found.

- en: In multiobjective optimization, the fitness of each individual in the population
    is evaluated based on multiple objectives simultaneously. This allows the GA to
    capture a set of solutions that are not dominated by any other solution in the
    population, known as the Pareto-optimal front.

    space dominates it. Figure 1 illustrates how a single solution can divide the
    objective space into four quadrants. The lower left quadrant contains solutions
    that dominate the considered solution; all solutions in this quadrant perform
    better with respect to both objectives. Solutions in the upper right quadrant
    are dominated by the considered solution. The upper left and lower right quadrants
    contain solutions that are not comparable to the considered solution. The set
    of non-dominated solutions consists of solutions that reside in these quadrants
    with respect to all other solutions.

- en: Most multi-objective optimization approaches, such as NSGA-II, rake selection,
    and selection based on the hypervolume indicator, begin with non-dominated sorting.
    This process involves sorting the population of the GA based on their non-domination
    rank. A solution is considered non-dominated if it is not dominated by any other
    solution. The first rank consists of all non-dominated solutions, and if these
    solutions are removed, the second rank is formed by solutions that are not dominated
    by any remaining solutions. This process continues until all solutions have been
    ranked. Figure 2 provides an illustration of how solutions are sorted into different
    ranks, with pink squares representing non-dominated solutions, orange squares
    representing solutions in the second rank, and grey squares representing solutions
    in the third rank. The non-dominated solutions in the first rank serve as the
    basis for a secondary selection process.

- en: One effective method for maintaining a uniform spread of solutions in objective
    space is known as rake selection. It is based on rakes that are positioned orthogonally
    on a rake base and extend into the area of the objective space where non-dominated
    solutions are located, see Figure 3\. The rake base connects the optimal solutions
    with regard to the single objectives. For each rake, the closest point among the
    solutions with rank one is selected. If there are too few non-dominated solutions,
    solutions from the next rank may also be considered. The distances between points
    and lines can be computed efficiently, regardless of the dimensions of the objective
    space.

- en: The optimal points that form the basis of the rake base can be computed by optimizing
    each objective individually and then computing the additional coordinate points
    in objective space using the fitness values for the remaining objectives. Alternatively,
    the rake base can be computed using the best solutions for each objective from
    the current population. This on-the-fly computation of the rake base can result
    in varying positions.

- en: The efficacy of the rake approach is most pronounced when the Pareto front has
    a linear shape. As the front becomes more curved, the rakes become less effective
    in cutting it in parallel lines. However, an adaptation of the rake approach based
    on the shape of the current set of non-dominated solutions is possible. A similar
    mechanism has been proposed in [2] where a ratio is computed to adjust the rake
    distances at each step based on the connection between the rakes and the selected
    solutions. This approach allows for greater flexibility and effectiveness in handling
    Pareto fronts that are more complex in shape.

    problems ZDT1 to ZDT4 are shown in Figure 4\. The rake base connects the corner
    points, and the perpendicular lines define the rakes in the objective space. It
    is important to note that the rakes may not appear perpendicular to the rake base
    in this figure due to the unequal scaling of the axes.

    the solutions are located on the rakes and the curves of the Pareto fronts. This
    demonstrates the effectiveness of the Rake Selection method in identifying solutions
    that are non-dominated and represent the best trade-offs between multiple objectives.

- en: In summary, multi-objective optimization is a critical area of research with
    a wide range of applications. GAs are an effective tool for multi-objective optimization,
    as they operate based on a population of solutions and can explore a diverse set
    of solutions to capture the trade-offs between multiple objectives. Non-dominated
    sorting and rake selection are techniques that can be used to efficiently identify
    the Pareto-optimal front and select the best trade-off solutions. The experimental
    results show that the Rake Selection method is effective in identifying non-dominated
    solutions and achieving the best trade-offs between multiple objectives. Overall,
    multi-objective optimization is a powerful approach that can provide valuable
    insights into complex systems and inform decision-making processes.
