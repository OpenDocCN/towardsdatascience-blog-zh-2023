    or not the role of a **data analyst** could eventually be replaced by generative
    AI (ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat are among the large language models included
    in this classification)**.** Much of this speculation is fueled by the ability
    of these large language models(LLMs) to write code.

    career, understanding the impact of generative AI in our field is something that
    has definitely piqued my interest. Giving in to curiosity, I have since spent
    a fair amount of time assessing the current capabilities of generative AI within
    the context of data analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, I summarize and share my findings with you as I believe generative
    AI will have a significant rolein data analysis work going forward. Furthermore,
    I believe that it is imperative for the data analyst community to understand the
    profound impact it will have on not only their field but the business landscape
    as a whole.

    We can also assume the efficiency of the code they produce will only get better
    over time with continuous fine-tuning. But that’s just the start.

    Interpreter**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter). If you
    are one of the few who currently have access to the Alpha version, you can upload
    data files into it and invoke Python to perform regression analysis and descriptive
    analysis, look for patterns in your data and even create visualizations. ***All
    without having to write or even know a line of Python code!*** Esteemed Wharton
    School of Business professor [Ethan Mollick has a nice write-up on this](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/it-is-starting-to-get-strange).

    writing a stitch of code. Game over yes? Not so fast.

    limitations to Code Intrepretor, that are indicative of some of the challenges
    that generative AI would have in taking over the data analysis industry.

    limited to 100 MB). The size limitation aside, imagine being tasked with building
    one table with all of your company’s data…

    with ALL of your company’s data pushed outside of your company’s firewall into
    an LLM that they have no control over…

- en: We can probably stop there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ***current*** alternative(more on this later) to the above would be that
    your company builds its own LLM. While theoretically possible, the complexities
    of training and fine-tuning the model, the expertise required and the enormous
    costs of doing so would only make that cost-effective for an extremely short list
    of companies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is on that list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But first, let’s start with some perspective. If we look back to the introduction
    of business intelligence tools in the early 2000s, the great value of those tools
    lies in their ability to provide non-technical, line-of-businesspeople the ability
    to leverage their domain knowledgeby enabling them to select, analyze and present
    data, without writing a stitch of code. Sound familiar?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Providing user-friendly means to analyze data is nothing new. It will always
    have incredible value. Indeed, it is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues
    to grow. However, these tools have no use without ***domain knowledge***. This
    applies to any data analysis, regardless of the tool(s) being used. Even if it's
    generative AI. Without domain knowledge, we do not know what questions to ask
    of our data. And even if the questions were provided to us, how do we interpret
    our findings?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in my view, the greatest value of data analysis work lies in its ability
    to answer ad hoc questions. Unforeseen, mission-critical questions. Complex, multi-layered,
    nonlinear types of questions. Answering these questions requires domain knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, why did sales on our best-selling product just drop off a cliff?
    Our primary supplier just went out of business, what do we do? Why did our customer
    churn rate double last month? These are not straightforward types of questions
    that can follow an established decision tree.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What these few examples have in common is that they require immediate answers
    to situational questions that have never been asked before. And that is really
    the key. If you understand the construct of generative AI, its inability to answer
    questions of this nature is truly its Achilles heel in ever being able to replace
    data analysts fully.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To briefly summarize, generative AI utilizes existing data sets to ‘train’ an
    LLM to ***generate*** a probability-driven answer based on whatever training data
    it has been fed. And while you can continuously fine-tune your model with ever
    more precise data sets, how would you train your model on multi-layered, situational
    questions that have never been asked before?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It would be analogous to you starting a new job as a data analyst in an industry
    that you are not yet familiar with. And on day one, you are asked to urgently
    answer one of the questions above. Where would you even start? What data would
    you pull? How would you even know what all of the potential variables you would
    need to consider? And, even if you could somehow derive an answer, how would you
    know if it is correct?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is for these reasons that I don’t foresee the role of data analyst ever being
    fully replaced by generative AI. However… generative AI, in its current state,
    already has many uses in the data analysis field and those uses will only continue
    to expand with ever-increasing functionality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As of today, the highest and best use of generative AI in the data analysis
    field is its ability to both write code and in turn, explain the code it writes
    (which it does quite well). I’ve personally used it to help me write and understand
    Python code.

    encourage you enough to take advantage of generative AI to help you learn to code.
    It would have greatly speeded up my learning curve when I was first cutting my
    teeth in this field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In another, truly exciting development for data analysts, generative AI has
    fueled the development of dedicated coding tools. GitHub has released its [***Copilot***](https://github.com/features/copilot)
    product, which can suggest coding solutions/improvements in real-time as you are
    writing it!

- en: 'Earlier in this article, I referred to the potential hurdles companies would
    face in building their own LLMs. There is possibly one new alternative to that:
    Databricks has recently released an ***open-source*** LLM called ’ [**Dolly**](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html?utm_medium=paid+search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=17107065832&utm_adgroup=150868748114&utm_content=blog&utm_offer=hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html&utm_ad=654151923015&utm_term=databricks+dolly&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsIejBhDOARIsANYqkD1fHrzElKeDiIZRaEhWgzSkv_L3_xjPmu23r2FaDLArEe77vyaOiAcaAg9kEALw_wcB)’.
    In theory, this could solve the issues of cost (being open source) and having
    to push your data outside of your company’s firewall. It’s a smaller-scale LLM,
    more suited for focused datasets.'
  prefs: []

    field of generative AI are moving and as a heads-up to how they may affect the
    data analysis field going forward.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no doubt in my mind that generative AI will reshape the workflows in
    data analysis. Generally speaking, repetitive types of tasks or even analyses
    will in time be performed by generative AI. I could also see coding becoming more
    of a commodity, versus being a highly developed skill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the above, I believe that the prototypical data analyst in the future
    will possess business line-level domain knowledge combined with an ability to
    incorporate generative AI tools to help them be more efficient and productive
    with their time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, on a personal note, I would encourage anyone reading this to embrace
    generative AI. Learn about it and use it both in your personal and business lives.
    With new APIs and plugins constantly being created, its reach and capabilities
    will only grow.
