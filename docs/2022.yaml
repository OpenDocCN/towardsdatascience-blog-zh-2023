    discriminatory language, infringing equal employment opportunity laws. In contrast,
    well-drafted job descriptions attract premier talent, expedite hiring, endorse
    diversity and inclusion, and bolster the company’s reputation. Therefore, organisations
    must invest sufficient resources in creating thorough, accurate, and inclusive
    job descriptions, thereby ensuring effective recruitment, legal compliance, and

    learning, this concept refers to the process of understanding and comparing the
    meaning or semantics of different pieces of text or data. It involves assessing
    the similarity or relatedness between words, phrases, sentences, or even entire
    documents. The goal is to determine how well different pieces of text align in
    terms of their underlying meaning, rather than just relying on surface-level patterns
    or exact word matching. Semantic matching plays a crucial role in various Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as information retrieval, question answering,
    sentiment analysis, and text classification. It helps to bridge the gap between
    the human understanding of language and the computational capabilities of machine
    learning models.

    profile aligns with the requirements of the job. Through semantic matching, you
    can efficiently prioritise and evaluate candidates based on their suitability
    for the role they applied to (and other roles as well, all in an automated fashion).
