    things: politics, religion, and money. In this article, I break polite conventions
    to determine how an AI would respond to all three of those topics. As AI tools
    become more and more integrated into our lives (such as [writing news articles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-to-use-chatgpt-creator-openai-to-help-create-some-of-its-content-11674752660)
    or being used in [mental health chatbots](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/chatgpt-ai-experiment-mental-health-tech-app-koko-rcna65110)),
    it’s important (and curious) to know if these tools generate outputs that reflect
    certain political opinions.'

    contentious political, economic, and social topics by having it take the [Political
    Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/about), a popular test for measuring
    one’s political leaning. All of the questions included in this article are replicated
    from the website.

    economic ideology; the up and down axis measures social ideology. The red dot
    describes the political opinions reflected by the outputs of GPT-3: economically
    moderate-left and socially libertarian.'
