    often takes you an immeasurably long amount of time. This rings especially true
    when it comes to teaching yourself data analysis.

- en: From coding to mathematics to data visualization, data analysis encapsulates
    three very different skills that all require various methods of learning. Not
    only that, but it can be easy to get sucked down the rabbit hole of Youtube tutorials
    and data analysis articles which can lead you to even spend more time learning
    than you had originally anticipated.
  prefs: []

- en: I’ve made my fair share of mistakes while learning data analysis, the top of
    which I’ve listed below, along with some practical ways to avoid them that you
    can begin implementing immediately. Learning data analysis doesn’t have to be
    a long process as long as you know when to put pen to paper (so to speak), when
    to use the tools you already know instead of learning new ones, when to focus
    on learning only the skills you need, and when to put your foot down and finish
    your goal of learning data analysis.

- en: Before studying software development at university, I attempted to teach myself
    to code many times by following online tutorials from Codecademy and Youtube.
    Unfortunately, I just spent all of my time doing the tutorials and never actually
    putting pen to paper (as it were) and creating something using what I learned.
    I wasted a lot of time not applying what I learned theoretically which resulted
    in a lack of tangible results.

- en: Learning the coding aspect of data analysis is probably the most hands-on portion
    that requires immediate implementation of what you’ve practiced via a tutorial.
    For example, after writing out your whole analysis program, you could watch a
    tutorial on how to group your code into functions. Then, you should go into your
    project code and create functions that organize and simplify your code.

- en: Not only does this practice allow you to learn more quickly, but it also allows
    you to complete projects more quickly. For example, you may only be learning data
    analysis to complete a single project. Instead of waiting to work on your project
    until you’ve learned everything there is about coding in Python, you could begin
    chipping away at your project along the way as you learn different skills or techniques.

    undergraduate research that I’m undertaking. However, because there’s a deadline
    for me to complete the research stint and because I need to graduate eventually,
    I need to work quickly to get a grasp of what I need to add to my code and then
    implement it immediately.

    coding languages, tools, and platforms to become a data analyst. In fact, many
    data analysts do their jobs just fine by only using Excel. I’m not sure when Excel
    became uncool, but I’m here to say that you should use Excel for all of your data
    cleaning, and basically anything else you can think of.

    of the easiest to learn thanks to a multitude of resources online.

- en: When I was first learning data analysis, I wasted so much time learning all
    these new tools, coding tricks, and database hacks to work with my data. Instead,
    I could have immediately begun cranking out clean data and even entire analyses
    if I had just started using Excel from the beginning.

- en: The philosophy I want to impart to you is that, if you know a way of doing something
    and it works, keep using it. Yes, there may come a point in your career where
    you need to expand past using Excel, but for right now, don’t waste time learning
    how to conduct data analyses — instead, do more data analysis with the tools you
    already know!

- en: One of the biggest misconceptions about self-teaching data analysis is that
    you need to know advanced forms of mathematics. This is where terminology is important.
    Some people will either confuse or purposefully interchange the terms “data science”
    with “data analysis” and then base their description of the discipline on data
    science. In fact, the two are completely different. If you want to do data science,
    then yes, you will need to know advanced forms of mathematics. However, if you
    want to do data analysis, you can get away with much simpler forms of mathematics.

    and statistics (with the potential for some single-variable calculus thrown in
    there).

- en: By focusing on the math that you actually need to complete your analysis, you’ll
    save time that would otherwise be wasted on self-studying tricky mathematical
    concepts that you may never use. The best way to do this is to look at all of
    the mathematical requirements for a project and only learn those that you’re missing.
    This will shorten your learning time from potentially several months down to only
    a couple of weeks. Furthermore, this allows you to focus on your breadth of knowledge
    as opposed to your depth of knowledge. Remember, breadth of knowledge can be picked
    up quickly and implemented immediately. Depth of knowledge can take months or
    years to develop.

    the beginning of the semester containing the learning objectives of the course
    and everything you would need to learn to achieve those objectives? Those were
    invaluable documents that should be the inspiration to help us create our data
    analysis learning plans.

    You don’t want to get carried away with your learning only to realize three years
    later that you’re not quite sure what you’ve just learned and why it may or may
    not be relevant.

- en: For example, I’ll be working on some undergraduate research that will require
    me to conduct a data analysis. The data analysis is only a small part of the project,
    which means that I need to create a learning schedule for the aspects that I need
    to self-teach that also takes into account all of the other parts of the project
    that I need to complete. In other words, I can’t spend the whole time teaching
    myself data analysis concepts because there’s a whole list of other things that
    need to get done. Furthermore, the learning plan needs to have a few clear objectives
    that, once achieved, are left behind so I can begin implementing the skills into
    my project. As I said previously, I don’t want to go down a rabbit hole of learning
    only to realize that what I just learned wasn’t necessarily a good use of my time.

- en: The trick is to create a learning plan with a hard deadline and three clear
    objectives. These objectives should either refer to practical skills, add up to
    the completion of a project, or to a job in data analysis. The objectives must
    be this way so that once you’ve completed some learning, you can assess whether
    you’ve achieved the objective or whether you need to do some further learning.
    The goal is to give a definitive “yes” when asked if you could complete any of
    the objectives in a test-like scenario.

    you from getting distracted, falling off course, studying the wrong things, or
    taking years to finish what could be completed in just a few weeks.
