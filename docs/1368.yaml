    starts bringing you benefits. It is a complicated process, often requiring many
    difficult decisions. At some point, the need to migrate to the cloud falls upon
    your tech experts, from data scientists to machine learning engineers, who could
    be unprepared to handle this task alone. To alleviate the situation, our professional
    IT consultants and [cloud migration services experts](https://www.itransition.com/cloud)
    have joined the efforts to help you along the way.

- en: The following guide provides five essential steps to control your cloud migration
    project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Define how much cloud capacity you need
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The traditional providers of internet infrastructure don’t sell computational
    power. Instead, they sell resources, or, to be more specific, servers that run
    24/7, charging you by the hour even when you aren’t using these resources. In
    most cases, your cloud-based application or system is not fully loaded during
    the prepaid time, so you’re wasting your budget away paying for the server’s idle
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, the numbers will vary depending on your scale of operations. For example,
    if a local company goes without night-time operations like reporting or maintenance,
    it will face 12 hours of downtime. It means that 50% of their infrastructure budget
    goes down the drain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scalability is a sensitive matter
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simply purchasing a large server based solely on abstract traffic predictions
    can be too optimistic, while buying a small server can backfire if you end up
    going viral and your system crashes under immense pressure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, the right approach to your cloud migration strategy would be to go
    for the cloud capable of auto-scaling or to use serverless backend systems based
    on AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or similar specialized services. Such services
    enable automatic backend scaling, meaning you can benefit from pay-as-you-go and
    pay-as-you-use models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, using the cloud is not always a good idea. For example, when hosting
    in the cloud, you don’t know on which physical servers your components will be
    deployed. Network-attached storage could be less efficient than local drives.
    And in the case of high-loaded systems where the response time is critical, local
    servers can work better.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Adjust your architecture
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you migrate your system as is, the cloud will always be more expensive than
    local storage. To optimize costs, you should adjust your architecture before migration
    and choose the right services to facilitate this complex process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also add the cloud provider management costs and scalability overheads
    since cloud providers offer fully managed services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considering all these factors, the only correct approach to [cloud migration](https://www.g2.com/glossary/cloud-migration-definition)
    is deciding which system components must be left on premises and which need to
    be migrated to the cloud.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and the underutilized ones. Optimizing the architecture first will make the cloud
    cheaper than a dedicated server. To help you with that, here’s a list of the most
    typical out-of-the-box steps you can take:'

    providers such as AWS and Azure, currently the two most popular ones.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Answering the notorious pricing question is incredibly difficult. The calculations
    can easily sway to either side depending on what you think is the best option
    — on-premises or the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s provide a straightforward example. Imagine you have a system that was
    initially designed to run on-premises. This is a very busy system with more than
    10 TB of data, an 8,000,000+ events per day update rate, and a 30,000 events per
    minute throughput. You’re going to need a cloud migration strategy for this system.

    while requiring fewer languages. And, by using serverless services, you will see
    a dramatic cut in overall costs.

    and support, and resource optimization.

    for example, banking and finance, the public sector, insurance, and healthcare.
    However, many highly regulated organizations, including government agencies, that
    work with different types of sensitive data have found a way to host their systems
    on the cloud.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many businesses referring to external software development services and looking
    to adopt the cloud fear the so-called vendor lock-in, that is, being unable to
    leave the cloud or change their provider after committing to one. Also among the
    most significant concerns are the interoperability and portability of applications
    when switching vendors and the fear of paying even more to change the infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    provider’s brand name by researching their documentation or asking an expert.
    For example, here are some services from the AWS stack that are open-source or
    interoperable:'

- en: You can also choose cloud services that utilize either standard or open protocols,
    allowing you to switch providers when necessary. In addition, open protocols make
    room for equipment interoperability without using proprietary gateways or interfaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, if cloud services offer their own proprietary protocols alongside open
    protocols, then the advice is always to opt for the latter. For example, Azure
    Service Bus provides its own API as well as a supporting AMQP — an open messaging
    protocol. By choosing an open standard, you get to remain flexible. This means
    you can switch your provider or even deploy your own service instance that supports
    the same protocol without making any significant changes in client components.
