    to deliver value from data intensifies. In fact, [2023 is the year of ROI in the

    including the ability to unify your company’s vision, improve decision-making,
    and increase productivity. Additionally, data sharing can also help to foster
    innovation and drive improvements in data quality throughout your company. Let’s

    strategy by creating a marketplace for employees to autonomously access and use
    the data they need.

    the same context around data. That is, it brings everyone onto the same page regarding
    definitions, how metrics are calculated, and which datasets are the best to use.
    It ensures everyone speaks the same language, based on a shared set of definitions
    and vocabulary. This leads to consistency across reports produced by different
    departments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the absence of data sharing, departments can operate in silos, and their
    reports often end up disagreeing. The risk of this is that each unit may use different
    definitions and methods of calculation for the same concepts. And when people
    have different definitions, their reports say different things. Reports that contradict
    each other slow down decision-making and lead to trust erosion. Data sharing allows
    companies to eliminate this kind of incoherence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond that, Data sharing allows for greater visibility into how the organization
    functions. Every department can track progress and see the bigger picture. This
    can foster collaboration and help everyone work towards the same set of goals,
    instead of focusing on their own, isolated views.

    decisions. No more guessing or relying on gut feelings.

    without compromising on speed. This way, data can power real-time decisions across
    all departments, in addition to fueling long-term strategic decisions through
    reporting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, data democratization removes traditional bottlenecks in the decision-making
    process. When only technical teams can access data, other teams have to ask for
    their help to get information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many organizations, the distribution of data to various consumers is still
    done manually. First, business users request a dataset. Then, the analytics team
    takes in the request, interprets it, and tries to verify the request with the
    business team. When the interpretation is wrong, this little back-and-forth game
    can go on for a while.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This delays the decision-making process and burdens technical teams. Plus, a
    data team that needs to keep up with business people’s requests does not scale
    well.
  prefs: []

- en: Data sharing frees up the analytics team for deeper, more meaningful data analysis.
    When analytics can move away from basic reporting — providing data facts to other
    teams, and answering tickets — they can focus on what we really need analysts’
    skillsets for.

    time for technical teams. In short, it means better, faster, smarter decisions
    for everyone. What’s not to love?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When relying on manual processes to request and deliver data, speed is a major
    issue. With data sharing, stakeholders don’t have to spend time searching for
    data or waiting for someone else to provide it to them. This also reduces the
    risk of errors, as employees have access to the most up-to-date and accurate data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data sharing also eliminates duplication of work and dashboard re-building.
    If something already exists, stakeholders will know it. They will build on the
    existing stuff rather than starting a project from scratch. And re-using is more
    efficient than re-building.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When departments operate in silos, different teams spend time re-building the
    same stuff. This is because they don’t have a way of checking if a given material
    already exists.

    This saves both time and resources, making organizations more efficient and productive.

    they might not have been able to get on their own. This can spark new ideas and
    approaches that they might not have considered before.

    the sales department, they might be able to identify new ways to target potential

    to see what others are working on and share their own ideas and insights. This
    can lead to new perspectives and approaches. These usually do not emerge when
    teams are operating in silos.

    It gives employees the information they need to collaborate with their colleagues

    help you boost data quality. Data Sharing increases scrutiny and verification
    of the data’s accuracy and completeness.
  prefs: []

- en: With more pairs of eyes looking at the data, it is easier to spot mistakes or
    poor-quality data. This leads to greater accountability for **data quality** and
    the ability to fix any issues that may arise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data sharing also enhances trust in the reliability of the data. When a small
    group controls the data, it can be hard for others to verify its **accuracy**
    or understand the context in which it was collected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can lead to skepticism and mistrust of the data, which can act as a roadblock
    to decision-making. Data sharing thus makes it easier for everyone to **understand
    and trust** the data they’re using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data sharing thus means better data quality, enhanced decision-making, and improved
    context. All this can lead to smarter decision-making and greater alignment between
    different departments. Sounds like a no-brainer to me.
