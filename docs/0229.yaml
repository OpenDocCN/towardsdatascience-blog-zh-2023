    the same context around data. That is, it brings everyone onto the same page regarding
    definitions, how metrics are calculated, and which datasets are the best to use.
    It ensures everyone speaks the same language, based on a shared set of definitions
    and vocabulary. This leads to consistency across reports produced by different
    departments.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the absence of data sharing, departments can operate in silos, and their
    reports often end up disagreeing. The risk of this is that each unit may use different
    definitions and methods of calculation for the same concepts. And when people
    have different definitions, their reports say different things. Reports that contradict
    each other slow down decision-making and lead to trust erosion. Data sharing allows
    companies to eliminate this kind of incoherence.

- en: Beyond that, Data sharing allows for greater visibility into how the organization
    functions. Every department can track progress and see the bigger picture. This
    can foster collaboration and help everyone work towards the same set of goals,
    instead of focusing on their own, isolated views.

    reporting.

    process. When only technical teams can access data, other teams have to ask for
    their help to get information.

    done manually. First, business users request a dataset. Then, the analytics team
    takes in the request, interprets it, and tries to verify the request with the
    business team. When the interpretation is wrong, this little back-and-forth game
    can go on for a while.
  id: totrans-31

    issue. With data sharing, stakeholders don’t have to spend time searching for
    data or waiting for someone else to provide it to them. This also reduces the
    risk of errors, as employees have access to the most up-to-date and accurate data.

    If something already exists, stakeholders will know it. They will build on the
    existing stuff rather than starting a project from scratch. And re-using is more
    efficient than re-building.
