    that one event or action can lead to another event or outcome. In other words,
    causality is concerned with understanding how things happen and why they happen.

    transitioning to renewable energy sources will help meet climate goals. However,
    understanding causality can be complex and requires careful analysis to determine
    the true relationships at play. That’s where the science and art of causality

    have a statistical test that will tell you if your effect is causal or not. You
    can do many things in that direction. Numerous statistical tests can be done to
    challenge what we call the identifying assumptions (the assumptions to identify
    the causal effects), but usually, we cannot test those assumptions directly.
  prefs: []

    foundation in statistics and a deep domain knowledge. You have to use your critical
    thinking skills to consider the relationships between different variables and
    events. Math alone will not save you. The main challenge is often in how we interpret
    the statistical measures we use — we may mistake a correlation for a causal effect.

    illustrate this concept with the two graphs below. On the left, you have the global
    direct primary energy consumption in the world, split between renewable energies
    and other sources of energy production. The second graph represents the CO2 emissions
    of the world, also from 1900 to 2020\. Both are growing. However, we tend to think
    that using renewable energy help to reduce CO2 emissions. Using such aggregate
    data, some people might be tempted to argue that renewable energies are not necessarily
    useful.

    hand, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can be used as substitutes
    for fossil fuels and thus lead to lower CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the
    process of extracting resources to produce photovoltaic cells is energy-intensive,
    and the “rebound effect” (where people consume more energy when it is provided
    by renewable sources) can also lead to higher CO2 emissions. Without more data,
    it is impossible to definitively answer the question of whether renewable energy
    leads to higher or lower CO2 emissions. Bottom line, it is impossible to answer
    the question with such data.

    And as it’s the only thing that changed between the two worlds, if there is a

    renewable energy use.

    the same situation with and without a particular treatment or action. This creates
    the **“fundamental problem in causal inference”**, as we cannot observe the counterfactual
    — the alternative reality in which a treatment or action was not taken. For example,
    we can’t observe a person who is sick both taking and not taking a medication
    at the same time. What we try to do in causal inference is to get as close as
    possible to this ideal situation, where we can compare the outcomes of the same
    situation with and without a particular treatment or action. This allows us to
    better understand the causal relationships at play.

    representative of a larger population, and randomly allocate subjects between
    two groups (treatment and control) or more. The subjects typically do not know
    whether they receive the treatment or not (a process known as blinding). Therefore,
    the two groups are arguably comparable. Since the only difference is the treatment,
    if we observe an effect, it is potentially causal, provided that no other biases
    exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there are two main weaknesses with Randomized Control Trials (RCT).
    The first is that we cannot always use RCT. Sometimes it’s impossible, for example
    to change the sex of a subject just for the sake of an experiment. In other situations,
    it is unethical. For example, I have a paper assessing the effect of weapons exports
    on the probability of conflict in Africa. We are not going to randomly send weapons
    in different countries to see if it affects the probability of conflict.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second main weakness is that usually when we control perfectly the environment
    for an experiment it might come at the cost of external validity (to what extend
    we can extrapolate the results beyond the scope of the study). For example, medical
    research is often done with inbred strains of rats/mice. Those animals are almost
    identical genetically and hence we are close to the parallel worlds situation.
    But again, the drawback is that then we lose external validity.
  prefs: []

    and the extend to which the results reflects well real life situations.

    lethal or very dangerous level of pollution. Even if animal research migh be useful,
    we might struggle to extrapolate to humans. We might be interested about what

    The authors used the Olympic Games in Beijing to measure the causal effect of
    air pollution on mortality. The government imposed very strict laws to reduce
    pollution over the city before and during the Games (e.g. closure of power plants,
    reduction of the use of cars). This situation allows to observe exactly the same
    people before, during and after. These individuals experienced a sudden change
    in their level of pollution exposure, going from a high level of exposure to a
    significantly lower one. The author found that “*a 10 percent decrease in PM10
    [small particulate matter in the air] concentrations reduces the monthly standardized
    all-cause mortality rate by 8 percent.*”.
