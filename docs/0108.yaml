    the perfect time to zoom out from the daily grinding and see the big picture.
    I love reading articles on learnings and trends from my peers as well as industry
    leaders, taking time to review my year, and planning for the next one. So I wanted
    to share my take on what will be top of mind in data analytics next year.

    data available in near real-time, decision latency is the current bottleneck in

    negative business impact, undermined data culture, and a downward spiral leading
    to attrition.'

    so that they will be more willing to share their information. To achieve this,
    businesses need to better structure, record, and create more transparency on how
    they process and handle data. Moreover, effective data governance will become
    more relevant. Depending on the compliance stage, this could mean some retrospective
    work on the data at hand, how it has been collected and stored and how it has
    been used.

    the business and focusing on data analysis, insights generation, and taking action
    to maximize the business value. I expect data foundational projects to be deprioritized
    unless they are critical or bring significant cost savings.
