    an organization in a measurable way. And it doesn't mean you need an impressive
    technical solution to do it.

    that explains the reasons behind an event, and demonstrate its impact on the business.
    This can require a technical approach with advanced tooling, but that's not ultimately
    what matters.

    are you with the intricacies of delivering your product(s) or service(s)? Your
    domain knowledge should be focused on the area of the business that you report
    on (Finance, Operations, Marketing etc.) as well as holistically across the organization.
    The more knowledgeable you are about the business itself, the better approach
    you will have in generating an analysis and delivering impact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This also means that you have an understanding of how source systems collect
    and validate the data that you are reporting on. You should know the ins and outs
    of the operational processes which comprise certain metrics, as well as the limitations
    of what questions can be answered on top of it. If you are an ecommerce business
    — how is a page view measured from Google Analytics? Or if you work in supply
    chain, what does “Time to Fulfillment” represent & how is it shown in SAP?

- en: It's not uncommon for great Data Analysts to come from a domain specific coordinator
    / analyst role (ie. a Finance Analyst, Marketing Coordinator etc). This is an
    effective route because being on the ground level of a business process gives
    you much more insight on how the organization functions.

    a dashboard on flight bookings, don't you think it would be an unfair advantage
    to have worked in the reservation department? You would have an understanding
    of all relevant data points entered in their booking system, what they mean to
    the business, and challenges surrounding this process.

- en: Inevitably, you are not going to have every answer to the business problems
    that you are presented with as a Data Analyst. Therefore, you are going to need
    to partner with other teams to get clarity on a specific piece of data that you
    need, or the business process behind how something is generated.
  prefs: []

- en: Data Analyst roles are also front facing to an organization, where you may be
    presenting your findings to peers, management, C-Suite, or external clients. You
    need to dust off your presentation skills and be able to communicate complex results
    in a meaningful way.
  prefs: []

    and management don't want to hear the details of how you’ve manipulated your [Pandas

    or how many [common table expressions](https://learnsql.com/blog/what-is-common-table-expression/)
    exist in your SQL statement. Rather, you need to be able to abstract the technical
    aspects of your work and only communicate what is most important.

- en: When approached with a business question to answer, you need to conceptualize
    what data is available, and how it can be transformed to answer that question
    correctly. It will not always be clear how to connect the dots between the initial
    problem statement and the available data, but having a continued curiosity behind
    the “why” will always allow you to succeed in this area.
  prefs: []

- en: For example, let’s say your organization asks you to create a report on how
    many client contracts are being upsold each month. On the surface, this sounds
    like a straightforward question, but it gets more complex when you arrive at the
    available data. The first thing you need to determine is how a contract term is
    identified so it can be aggregated by month. Are you just referencing an end date
    on the contract record, or do you have to look in the billing system to verify
    if payment is still being collected? Perhaps it's a mix of both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then once you know how the contract term is identified- how do you determine
    if it's an upsell, downsell, flat renewal, or cancellation? Are we looking at
    the net change of the account before and after the term? Or is there another set
    of criteria we need to reference?

- en: Stakeholders are the clients of Data Analysts; they are the folks that benefit
    and action off of the reports that you generate. And just like anything else,
    if a client is unsatisfied with your service, they’ll look elsewhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Analysts need to understand the roles of the people who they are delivering
    reports to. Think about the surrounding questions that your stakeholders might
    be fixated on & what they personally care about in their job function. Working
    in Operations and Finance domains, a common question I’ve pretty much always needed
    to have a response on is “Why doesn’t X number tie to Y number?”. Being able to
    break down this reasoning to my stakeholders has always helped the conversation
    move in a positive direction.

- en: While you need to make sure you're answering everything that is asked of you,
    stakeholder management also means giving pushback in the right scenarios. But
    there is a fine line to this. You may have heard of the project management buzzword
    “[Scope Creep](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/5-ways-to-avoid-scope-creep#:~:text=Scope%20creep%20is%20what%20happens,completion%20of%20milestones%20and%20goals.)”.
    This is a valid concern when getting feedback on a project. During a dashboard
    or report review with your stakeholder, be sure to get a list of essential vs
    nice-to-have improvements as takeaways.

    a meaningful dialogue. But if you find that despite your efforts to question this

    to set aside your disagreement and just prioritize completing the task.

    role. Data never comes in a format where you can just *SELECT * FROM perfect_table*

    the technical solution behind the report.

    by a sales manager. It wasn't pretty to look at, nor did it have anything advanced
    to it. But this dashboard addressed a crucial sales goal with remarkable simplicity
    and significance. The key to its success was the manager’s profound understanding
    of the Sales team’s primary concerns.
