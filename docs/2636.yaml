    that’s about to go IPO funded by a16z. I’m talking about a real startup, from
    seed to series B — where every day can feel like you’re either about to soar or
    crash and burn — and there’s little in between.

    Where they are still trying to find the elusive “product market fit.” Where your
    equity could either quadruple or go to zero in an instant. Where “move fast and
    break things” is the mentality on a slow day.

    a lot of things and have spoken to a lot of other founders. I have also interviewed
    countless candidates over the years and wanted to bestow some advice for people
    who want to interview at an exciting startup.

    because the business in a startup can shift quickly— and ultimately that means
    you need to be comfortable with change and pace.

    data engineer. A startup is an entirely different experience, of which I’ll try
    to highlight below:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Significantly less “siloing”** — Big companies typically group people into
    divisions, and then sub-divisions each with their own sub-managers. By the time
    you look around, you’ll find yourself in a group in charge of a very narrow scope
    of tasks without much room to expand. Early stage startups don’t have this issue.
    You’re lucky if there’s a manager at all, in reality it’s just you and the CEO.
    You’re going to be exposed to everything from the front end, back end, business,
    product, customers, and even investors.'

- en: '**Zero support —** Very large enterprises usually have multiple teams that
    are responsible for different parts of the data stack. From infrastructure to
    security to different parts of the pipeline. All of these people can be used to
    help you with your particular body of work. In a startup, it’s all you. You have
    to figure out everything, from provisioning infrastructure to figuring out security.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Blurry business goals —** Large companies are (usually) great at scoping
    out work so your tasks are quite clear. Usually your work is just a cog in a giant
    system, so there’s usually clear input and outputs to your work. In a startup,
    your goal this week can be totally different next week.'

    market is changing. Or maybe the product isn’t picking up traction and you need
    to pivot. Overall, things change and you need to be comfortable with moving targets.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Insane pace and change —** One huge difference is pace. The most precious
    resource a startup has is time, especially if it’s VC funded. Every day wasted,
    is just another step closer to running out of money and closing up shop. Large
    companies have a lot more financial cushion and typically operate slowly due to
    bureaucracy and the need to “get alignment” from multiple leaders. One of the
    consequences for a startup is you need to build and ship fast — tech debt is a
    privilege. You’re not building for robustness in the beginning, you’re building
    to ship and get customer feedback ASAP. You can go back and make it better later.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Incredible impact-** One of the largest benefits to joining a startup is
    the impact. Due to all of the reasons above, you’ll be building the foundation
    of the core company product. Literally building it from nothing. Code you write
    could become legacy code for decades to come. You’ll rarely get that at a large
    company, where you’ll mostly provide incremental improvements to an existing large
    machine.'

    startup. With the basic differences between startups and large companies out of
    the way, I wanted to create a list of questions that was specific for a Data Engineer
    — versus general questions that anyone should ask (e.g. how much runway do you
    have?). If you want advice on general startup interview questions, [let me Google
    that for you](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=startup+interview+questions).

    want to join a startup:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**How important are your data pipelines for the business?** You want to understand
    how critical the data pipelines are for the business. Are they in the critical
    path for the business’s customers (e.g. a financial transaction)? Or are they
    more a support function for background tasks (e.g. financial reporting). Or are
    they more part of an R&D effort for a possible future expansion.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The closer the pipeline is to the critical path to the product, the more important
    and secure this position will be. Of course there’s nothing wrong with working
    on side efforts, but there’s an increase risk of project churn or layoffs if things
    get rough.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Do you need to build, maintain, or improve your current pipelines?** This
    question helps to understand the maturity of their data pipelines today. If they
    want you to build something from scratch, well obviously they are a very young
    company with zero maturity for their pipelines and culture. This could be a good
    or bad thing, as they probably don’t have any existing best practices and you’ll
    have to figure everything out. If it’s to improve their pipelines, then you know
    they have an urgent problem and pipelines are a high priority — which will probably
    lead to fulfilling (although busy) work.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**How did you arrive at your current data stack?** You want to understand how
    the existing leadership arrived at their current data stack. This will help inform
    you of how they think, what their priorities are, and how they think about data.
    This is very important to help align how they think with how you think. If they
    just picked random tools and slapped them together without much thought, that
    could be a red flag for you if you’re more the diligent type.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Do you need to build for speed or scale?** If the answer is speed, then that
    means they just want to ship product ASAP and robustness / quality is not a high
    priority. Literally the phrase “move fast and break things” applies here very
    well. They just need product to fly. If it’s for scale, then they will need something
    robust and will probably be OK if it takes some time. This should again be used
    to see if what they need aligns with how you like to build.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Who’s on the data team now?** The answer to this may be brief- “maybe you.”
    Otherwise you want to learn how big the team is, how big it is relative to the
    rest of the company and how they are organized. This is also another measurement
    of “data maturity” to help you get an idea of where they are in the growth process.
    People are typically the most expensive item for startups, so the amount of people
    on a team can really indicate to you how important the group is to the company.'

- en: Hopefully this post gives you some insight into the pros and cons of joining
    an early stage startup. At a high level, you should be interviewing them as well
    to see if their priorities, culture, and needs are a match for how you like to
    work. If it all looks good (and they have a healthy runway), I’d say go for it!
    You’ll never learn as much nor as fast as you would at a healthy startup.
