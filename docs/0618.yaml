    shape only in recent years. I have always been a curious person and I have always
    loved tinkering with numbers. Unfortunately, like most people of my generation
    in Italy, I did not receive any education during high school related to statistics,
    programming, or anything that nowadays would fall under the data science umbrella.
    I only had a couple of programming classes in Pascal, which made one thing certain
    when selecting my university major: I didn’t want to write code ever again. On
    the other hand, I was torn between my interest in human interactions and decision-making
    and my love for numbers. So, despite my main two options being sociology and math,
    I picked economics as a fair trade-off.'

    up being exactly what I was looking for: a scientific approach to studying human
    interactions. Some people despise economics because it translates everything into
    monetary values, but I think that, paraphrasing Churchill, “money is the worst
    measure of human incentives, except for all those other forms that have been tried
    from time to time”. If we want to take a scientific approach to human interactions,
    we need to quantify incentives, and money serves exactly that purpose, explicitly
    or implicitly, whether we like it or not.'

    data science as I think it should have (and does now). In terms of US education,
    I was basically forced to have a law, accounting, management, or finance minor
    with almost no option of investing more in computer science, informatics, or data
    science. As an undergrad, I was only taught Excel, and, during my master’s, I
    used Stata but there were no courses for Python or R. Moreover, the econometrics
    classes included mostly theory and algebraic proofs rather than programming and
    data analysis. Therefore, my first hands-on approaches to data science were spontaneous
    and self-taught. Luckily, it was the birth period of MOOCs and open lectures were
    gradually becoming available, often for free. Initially, I was just scraping the
    internet for movie information or local hiking trails. Then, I switched to more
    complex projects, like support bots for online card games, exploiting Bayesian
    dynamic decision-making models.

    I applied for grad school and received several offers, but I also got an offer
    for a position as a data scientist in a unicorn startup. I knew I loved numbers
    and I wanted to work with data, but I was also profoundly unsatisfied with my
    education. There were too many things I wanted to know and didn’t. In the end,
    curiosity prevailed and I went to grad school.

    in causal inference. I also attended my first-ever classes in programming, data
    science, and machine learning. However, I started my Ph.D. with a very precise
    research focus: antitrust and competition policy. Competition policy is the study
    of strategic interactions across firms and between firms and consumers. I was
    drawn to the topic for two main reasons. First, it seemed to me the branch of
    economics in which the agent’s rationality assumption made more sense. Firms directly
    or indirectly try to maximize profits and are (arguably) more rational than single
    individuals in their decision-making. Moreover, I wanted to do impactful research
    with clear policy applications, and in recent years there has hardly been a more
    active policy field than antitrust.'

    an academic to study the questions that I was interested in. I could only study
    those questions from a theoretical perspective, or concentrate my attention where
    I could find the data, usually narrower and secondary markets. Among the two options,
    I found the first one more inspiring: answering relevant questions imperfectly
    rather than answering irrelevant ones precisely (quoting my advisor). However,
    the result was that my research was only theoretical and I was not working with
    data as much as I wanted to. Unsurprisingly, the outputs were also mediocre: many
    people were supportive, but nobody was enthusiastic, myself included. I had come
    to a dead end.'

    for a while: leaving academia. It was not an easy decision, since leaving academia
    is internally perceived as a failure, especially in economics and in Europe. There
    is little information on the available opportunities, and the risk of “coming
    out” is losing professors’ attention and being downgraded to a second-class student.
    However, my advisor was extremely supportive and fully backup up my decision.'

    I decided to apply for Ph.D. internships in economics and data science for the
    following summer. I had done very little work outside of academia, and I wanted
    to explore my options further before committing. To prepare for the interviews,
    I started reviewing topics from the early years of grad school and new ones that
    I was interested in, but that I never intersected with in my research agenda.
    At first, I was just writing notes for myself, mixing code and text. At a certain
    point, I realized that I could make these notes public and I went for the blog
    that had helped me the most in discovering new topics in data science.

    extremely satisfying. It was a great incentive to explore topics in depth and
    to clarify, organize, and verbalize my thoughts. Moreover, readers appreciated
    my effort to translate academic research into more accessible content, and this
    came to me as a surprise. I was mostly writing for myself, and I didn’t expect
    anything out of it. I received public and private comments, mostly supportive
    and, if critical, constructive. It was the most satisfying moment of my Ph.D.
    experience. Academia, unfortunately, does not reward teaching, despite it being
    a significant share of a professor’s day-to-day job. There are also few incentives
    for reaching a broader audience, both in terms of outlets and language. The only
    thing that matters is writing scientific papers for academic journals. Writing
    for Towards Data Science was a breath of fresh air.

    ways to exploit data to answer causal questions, whether it is through randomized
    experiments or observational studies. Within causal inference, my choice of topics
    is usually either driven by the will to master a topic I already know, or to explore
    a new one. Often the two are correlated: I find an advanced topic that sounds
    fascinating, and, after I start reading about it, I soon realize that I need to
    review some basic notions to fully understand it. Then, I start reviewing and
    writing about the basics, tackling advanced topics only in a second moment. I
    found this approach to work particularly well, since it allows me to be more precise
    on advanced topics, without cluttering the articles with information, since I
    can refer to my previous work.'

    every article that I wrote, I added two more in the pipeline. I think I now have
    a list of around 50 articles I would like to write. Moreover, new research is
    constantly being released. Twitter has historically been the social network I
    used to stay up to date with academic research. Most economists, statisticians,
    and computer scientists in academia publish and discuss their work on Twitter.
    On the other hand, I have recently appreciated LinkedIn as a way to stay up to
    date with the industry. Researchers in the industry, practitioners, and data science
    influencers are mostly active on LinkedIn, which has been a great source of inspiration.
    One of my most interesting article-writing experiences, [on CUPED](/understanding-cuped-a822523641af),
    was born out of a LinkedIn post discussing this established industry technique
    to improve the efficiency of estimators for A/B tests that I never heard of. It
    sounded similar to other methods I knew, so I started exploring similarities and
    differences.

    school, I had the luck of studying with a brilliant friend who did not have a
    background in economics. They always remind me that one day I told them: “I love
    studying with you because you know nothing about econometrics, so you ask the
    most interesting questions!” It was not very delicate, but very true. There is
    no better way to check if you truly learned something than trying to explain it
    in simple terms to a curious person.'

    visualize notions in order to learn them. Preparing for an exam for me always
    meant writing a comprehensive but short summary of everything I knew, with as
    many examples, metaphors, plots, and diagrams as needed. The fact that other people
    would use that material was not only rewarding but also an extra incentive to
    be more clear and more intuitive.

    to write. My main advice, for writing as for any new activity, is: copy, smartly.
    Of course, it does not mean copy-paste. It means finding articles you would be
    proud of if you had written them, and analyzing them to understand what you like
    the most and in which dimensions they differ from your writing style. How do they
    open? What’s the narrative flow? How much detail do they go into? For a person
    who comes from academia, the most problematic thing is to translate notions that
    are learned from technical papers to notions that are intuitive to anyone. It
    is a hard translation process that we are not trained for. The opposite: we are
    trained to remove anything superfluous and stick to the bare minimum to make the
    text machine-readable.'

    is useless to inform out-of-sample decisions (as all decisions are). Prediction
    algorithms are still important since causality can be framed as a prediction problem
    for counterfactuals. To assess policy impact, we want to predict what would have
    happened without that policy, and to test a new policy, we want to know what will
    happen with and without it.

    data science terms, we do not have an appropriate training dataset. Marginal in-sample
    prediction improvements might bring more out of sample noise than signal. Data
    science recognized this problem a long time ago and has developed many methods
    to flag it, but not to solve it. Sample splitting has been the first step in this
    direction (incredibly overlooked in the social sciences): it tells you when something
    does not work but not why or how to fix it. The same goes for all the “data-drift
    detection” techniques: they are informative but not constructive. All the recent
    stress on data quality over quantity is another symptom of the growing interest
    in causality in computer science.'

- en: On the other hand, the social sciences are slowly internalizing the fact that
    there is a lot of data out there, and this data can be useful to answer causal
    questions. In particular, whenever we can frame a causal question as a prediction
    problem, there is the opportunity to borrow from machine learning literature.
    The main applications have been doubly-robust machine learning for covariates
    selection, generalized random forests for heterogeneous treatment effects, matrix
    completion methods for potential outcomes, and reinforcement learning for dynamic
    decision-making. The main trade-off concerns the fact that most of the (interesting)
    data is private and not available for research. Besides significantly hampering
    scientific inquiry in some fields (see competition policy above), it has also
    lowered the incentives to develop more data-hungry causal inference methods.

- en: Lastly, the role of causal inference in the industry is now established and
    will only grow further. New tech companies have experimentation and A/B testing
    at their decision-making core, while older companies either adapt or lag behind.
    I see two main trends starting now. First, expanding experimental causal inference.
    Network and spillover effects can bias simple difference-in-means estimators.
    And even when randomized experiments provide unbiased treatment effect estimates,
    additional data and/or models can help in increasing the precisions of the estimates.
    Second, quasi-experimental methods will become more prominent since not everything
    can be randomized, for practical, ethical, or cost reasons. I am very excited
    to witness the evolution of these trends and I hope to see a convergence in causal
    inference methods across disciplines.
