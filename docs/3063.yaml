- en: In Reinforcement Learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is often cited
    as the example for a policy approach, as compared to DQN (a value-based approach)
    and the big family of actor-critic methods which includes TD3 and SAC.

    unconvinced. Many teachers adopt a sort of hand-wavy approach. I don’t buy that,
    and neither should you.

    with both intuition and code. You can try different scenarios, and see for yourself
    that it works not just in principle but also in practice, and that there is no
    cherry picking.

    (sb3). Anyone following the documentation can get it running, without knowledge
    of the underlying model.

    If you simply treat PPO (or any model for that matter) as a black box, how do
    you expect your users to have faith in what you deliver?
