    trajectory is accelerating rapidly. In fact, the number of publications in this
    space has been rising dramatically in recent years. Stanford’s annual Artificial
    Intelligence Index Report shows that the number of AI publications has increased
    from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021 [1].

    intervals between major industry advances such as OpenAI’s [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/),
    [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/),
    or DeepMind’s [AlphaFold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371605/).
    Those are just some examples that captured the attention of both the general public
    and the tech industry as they were extensively reported on and widely circulated
    on social media. However, advancements are also becoming more frequent in other
    disciplines, ranging from robotics to drug discovery, self-driving cars, and space
    exploration.
