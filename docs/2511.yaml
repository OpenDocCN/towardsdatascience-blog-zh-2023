    I have always loved college sports. Growing up, I lived in a Big Ten/SEC household
    and a Big East (now ACC) town which meant a deluge of college sports filled the
    television screen from the first kick-off in August to the last buzzer beater
    in April. Recently, analytics has come to dominate both sports, but since it is
    football season let’s start there.'

- en: The last two off-seasons in college sports have been abuzz with NIL, transfer
    portal, and conference realignment news. I think the sentiment among most fans
    is captured by Dr. Pepper’s “[Chaos Comes to Fansville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq-Ye91fAm0)”
    commercial. I began to notice that every conversation about conference realignment,
    in particular, was filled with speculation and fueled by gut feeling. There was,
    however, a common faith that some great and powerful college football Oz was crunching
    numbers to decide which team was worth adding to which conference. I still haven’t
    had the opportunity to meet his man behind the curtain, so until then I’d like
    to take a shot at proposing a data-driven conference realignment.
