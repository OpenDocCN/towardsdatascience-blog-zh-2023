    such as Data Management, Data Engineering and Data Analysis. I was thinking about
    what went well and what was rather challenging and how people and their skills
    (also mine!) influenced the success of data projects. Based on these experiences,
    I have compiled the following list of important skills that make a good data manager!
    Please note that it is not based on an empirical study and I am not writing as
    a researcher here — this list simply aggregates some personal observations — so
    if you see further skills, just add them to the comments :)

    Every data project hits the point where someone in the project needs to draw something
    that represents either the status quo or that catches the different visions of
    stakeholders. So, please consider a model as a key technique for efficient communication
    within a data project! There are really sophisticated modelling tools around that
    support established modelling languages. And this second part is even more important:
    please apply established modelling languages! One of the biggest mistakes you
    can make is to try to put every aspect of the data project into one chaotic PowerPoint
    diagram. You will end up with a monster that is neither a good data model nor
    a good process model. Instead, be aware that your data project has dynamic aspects
    ( → candidates for a process model) and static aspects (candidates for a data
    model or deployment model) that must surly fit together, but not necessarily within
    one diagram. There are established languages (e.g. BPMN, UML, Chen) and tools
    (e.g. visual paradigm,modelio, Enterprise Architect) that support syntax-conform
    language application or round-trip engineering. A model is something like a construction
    plan for physical buildings, so make sure that your plan is mature to avoid sloping
    floors and open walls in your data architecture caused by people in the project
    who interpret the model in different ways. And in the age of IoT, [fuzzy data
    models have implications on the physical world,](/fuzzy-data-structures-curse-or-blessing-5ee34ff39cd7)
    too. They limit the possibility of comparative data analysis or make it difficult
    to scale use cases.'

- en: The role of a data manager in an organization is tricky. This person is often
    neither an IT guy who implements databases on his/her own, nor a business guy
    who is actually responsible for data or processes (that’s rather a Data Steward’s
    area of responsibility). So what’s the real value-add of a data manager (or even
    a data management department)? In my opinion, you need someone who is building
    bridges between the different data stakeholders on a methodical level. It’s rather
    easy to find people who consider themselves as experts for a particular business
    area, data analysis method or IT tool, but it is rather complicated to find one
    person who is willing to connect all these people and to organize their competencies
    as it is often required in data projects. So what I am referring to are skills
    like networking, project management, stakeholder management and change management
    HIwhich are required to build a data community step-by-step as backbone for Data
    Governance. Without people, a data manager will fail! So in my opinion, a recruiter
    who seeks for data managers should not only challenge technical skills but also
    these people skills. Likewise, if you are interested in a data manager position,
    judge yourself if you feel comfortable with a job of various origanizational responsibilities
    beyond technical topics.

- en: 'I have seen various approaches to build data management organizations. There
    were closed teams as part of bigger business departments with global accountability
    for data standards, or federated organizations with a small core team and “dotted-line”
    data managers in other departments, or data management teams that were part of
    the IT department. Independent of the organization’s home — my experience shows
    that a good data manager should have fundamental domain knowledge. If a person
    acts as data manager for a certain business area, she/he should understand what’s
    going on in the value chain, what are the critical business issues, which data
    exists for which purpose and what are the business processes that create and consume
    data and how they are connected. With this knowledge, a data manager can always
    think one step further if she/he receives a data change request. Maybe there are
    other requests in the pipeline which could be merged, maybe you have own ideas
    regarding the process implementation, maybe you suggest other stakeholders to
    involve ( → see #2), maybe there are policies (e.g. DSGVO) that must be implemented,
    maybe you can influence the sustainability of data models beyond this single request,
    … the list is long! Assuming that a data manager originally has an IT background,
    the creation of satisfactory domain knowledge could be a challenging task, simply
    because it’s industry-, company- or even department-specific and you cannot simply
    listen to an audio book to close that gap. However, keep calm and accept that
    there will be a learning curve over time, but it is essential that you are willing
    to learn and adopt that non-IT knowledge.'

- en: Refining a data change request from what a business stakeholder expects to what
    should be really implemented is a process. In my “home” industry, the semiconductors,
    also business experts often have an advanced IT knowledge — this is curse and
    blessing at the same time :) On the one hand, you can dive deeper into technical
    topics with all the stakeholders, on the other hand, they tend to come up with
    IT solution proposals instead of problem descriptions, which is not so welcome
    among the IT experts, because it somehow skips their responsibility. Besides the
    injured sense of honor, there are good reasons why building an implementation
    concept is separated from the requirements analysis. One of them is that there
    is not “the one” solution but various options with pros and cons. As important
    as the domain expertise is the awareness of up-to-date data management technologies
    and their capabilities. For instance, not every piece of master data must be entered
    manually, even if the data steward expects that. Maybe there are attributes from
    a record that can be deduced by a business rule system or filled via data integration
    from other systems. Or, a problem could be solved by changing the task order in
    a business process, which could be supported and forced by workflows. Also data
    catalogs have some powerful features that help data managers in their overarching
    role — [please view my series on a particular tool to get more information](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/datahub-hands-on-part-i-f0709e7efec9).
    Especially if data managers have a non-IT background, this skill can be challenging.
    Fortunately, the technical knowledge is often not company-specific, hence, the
    gap can be closed with official material (videos, MOOCs, books, articles, …).
    From a didactic perspective, I would recommend to define a learning path for junior
    data managers that provides overview and insight into selected technologies.

- en: Last but not least, I made good experiences with applying the lean philosophy.
    “Lean” is typically associated to the manufacturing business, but can also be
    applied for data management. For instance, you can use “Poka Yoke” principles
    to design data processes or GUIs to avoid certain data quality issues by design.
    Or, you could apply “5S” to clean-up your data architecture, where data valuation
    helps to judge which data objects in your organization are “waste” and which are
    business-critical — [we have published a research paper that proposes such an
    approach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3537693.3537725). Especially in larger
    data projects, e.g. when you want to integrate a whole domain into a master data
    management system, it’s worth to organize “Kaizen” events, where all the stakeholders
    work together in a workshop mode to shape the future (conceptual) data landscape.
    A great method is also “PDCA” which helps to improve data quality iteratively
    — and there are still more lean methods that I have already applied in data projects
    and that are useful! In my opinion, the lean approach is the key to gain sustainable
    data architectures. This sustainability effect can be observed as well in traditional
    applications of lean management as discussed in [this (German) article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-21686-3_3#Sec4).
    The generic types of waste in a value chain can also be found in data architectures,
    such as motion (e.g. unnecessary manual efforts for data maintenance) and defects
    (e.g. wrong or missing data that limits the effectiveness of a data product).
    All in all, a probably underrated skill, but a great topic for further research!

- en: With this story, I wanted to share my view on the optimum skill set of a data
    manager. A good data manager is way more than a technical expert for data management
    software. Typically, data management initiatives succeed (or fail) due to the
    (missing) support of people in an organization. Hence, there are a number of non-technical
    skills such as stakeholder management or project management that should be learned
    and applied especially in more complex data projects. Nonetheless, IT knowledge
    is also important especially to resolve the waste in data architectures that could
    be found via the lean methods. Domain knowledge is something that you won’t learn
    at university but over time by actually working in a certain business, but you
    should be open-minded for that knowledge as well and you can actively influence
    the slope of your learning curve e.g. by interviewing experts! And don’t forget
    to apply established modelling techniques in your data projects! The more people
    in your organization get used to good models, the more efficient will be the future
    communication in data projects.
