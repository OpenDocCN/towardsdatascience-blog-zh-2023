    one hand, it takes time to catch up with foundational concepts and methods, even
    if you’ve worked in the field for a while. On the other hand, new tools and models
    keep popping up at a rapid clip. What’s an ML learner to do?'

    pieces of information at a steady, ongoing cadence will help you gain a firm footing
