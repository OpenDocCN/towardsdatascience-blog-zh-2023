- en: Our lives consist of constant decisions and choices. Because the consequences
    of our decisions can lead to considerable economic and social impacts, the research
    on decision-making was highly interdisciplinary from the beginning. Scientists
    from mathematics, sociology, psychology, economics, political science, and computer
    science have been actively studying how to make better decisions since the mid-20th
    century. Among the many achievements in these fields, the most well-known are
    the expected utility, prospect, and game theories. These theories are driven by
    mathematical models but often face challenges from empirical tests of real-world
    scenarios.

- en: With the tremendous increase in computation power and the blooming of cloud
    technologies, decision support systems (DSS) have advanced in parallel with the
    decision theories to assist humans in making decisions, particularly in the business
    and organizational context. A typical DSS includes scalable knowledge databases
    to collect and store large amounts of information, statistical and analytical
    algorithms for forecasting and projection, and user interfaces (including charts
    and dashboards) for human…
