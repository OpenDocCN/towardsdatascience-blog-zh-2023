- en: We, human beings, perceive the environment and surroundings with our vision
    system. The human eye, brain, and limbs work together to perceive the environment
    and act accordingly. An intelligent system can perform those tasks which require
    some level of intelligence if done by a human. So, for performing intelligent
    tasks, artificial vision system is one of the important things for a computer.
    Normally, the camera and image are used to gather information needed to do the
    job. Computer vision and Image processing techniques help us to perform similar
    tasks done by humans, like image recognition, object tracking, etc.

    the processor works as a brain to process the captured image and generate significant
    results. But there is a basic difference between humans and computers. The human
    brain works automatically, and intelligence is a by-born acquisition. On the contrary,
    the computer has no intelligence without human instruction (program). Computer
    vision is the way to provide the appropriate instruction so that it can work compatible
    with the human vision system. But the capacity is limited.
