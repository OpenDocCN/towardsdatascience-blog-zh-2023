    quite as high as it should be. We are rarely viewed as thought partners. We do
    excellent technical work, but it hardly draws a glance from the people that matter.
    Sure, we have a seat at the table when strategic decisions are being made, but
    only as the resident SQL technician. And it’s not due to lack of trying. We build
    self-service systems, we hold office hours, we build elaborate courses to level
    up our peers,but these initiatives never effect lasting change.

    But if we rely too heavily on dashboards as our main medium of communication,
    we’re perpetuating the myth that *data is obvious* — that our interpretation isn’t
    required. Obviously, we need to make dashboards, but we default to them *far too
    often*. We instinctively point our stakeholders to dashboards, rather than understanding
    their questions. They become empowered in the wrong way, and their increasingly
    narrow understanding of our value pigeonholes us into a data curation role.'

    instead — synthesizing and drawing on learnings from the wealth of past experiments
    and deep dives we’ve already conducted. We fail to provide *leveraged* value,

    we want impact, yet we chase excellency in what amounts to a trade skill — our

    on the data. This is likely why we still haven’t proven out the value of [analytics
    executives](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-missing-analytics-executive). Or why
    you still seeanalytics directors writing SQL for other executives. Or why our

    an insight without pulling and analyzing data. I’m not saying we should *stop*
    — that’d obviously be impossible. But we tend to over-index so heavily on the
    technical aspects of our work that we forget that analytics is not a purely technical
    domain. Analytics is about providing value through data. The “through data” part
    is certainly technical. But [“providing value” is not](https://www.winwithdata.io/p/alignment-pedantry).
    And the latter is where truly leveraged impact can come from.
