    have in recent years, terms like “state of the art” and “best practices” can seem
    meaningless. Last month’s cutting-edge model might already feel outdated; workflows
    that made perfect sense for your last project can become obsolete by the time
    you launch your next one.

    excitement. It also has a tendency to induce anxiety and a fear of falling behind—and
    those are ingredients we don’t really recommend adding to your data science learning
    stew. Instead, we love reminding ourselves (and anyone else who’d listen) that
    gradual, cumulative improvement is more than enough for sustainable professional
    growth.'

    Given the iterative (and occasionally repetitive) nature of data science work,
    [Rebecca Vickery](https://medium.com/u/8b7aca3e5b1c?source=post_page-----41a255debc1b--------------------------------)
    rightly reminds us that “it is highly important that whether you are a team of
    one data scientist working alone, or a large team working together, you develop
    a set of best practices.” She goes on to propose six ideas to help you formulate
    the right ones for your needs.'
