    we are all required to operate with less resources. When it comes to marketing,
    that means we need greater precision in all of our initiatives. Fortunately, the
    viable paths to profitable marketing can be found within data.

    approaches](/a-complete-guide-to-data-driven-customer-acquisition-f0f1708b328),
    we have repeatedly identified remarkable optimization opportunities within the
    first month. We saw the same optimization patterns over and over again across
    ecommerce verticals. In this article, I will share what we have learned and discuss
    how you can find marketing optimization opportunities in your organization through
    the lens of data science.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most ecommerce startups have very specific target audiences — otherwise, the
    space would be crowded with competition from large players. However, when it comes
    to advertising, there is an industry myth that brands can rely on ad platforms’
    broad targeting approaches to achieve optimal results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is clear this strategy is not applicable to all, as many ecommerce startups
    have told us that they have been struggling for a long time to get broad targeting
    to work. Let’s explore why broad targeting may work for large brands or brands
    that started advertising a few years ago, but doesn’t work for your startup.
  prefs: []

- en: Ad platforms use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science
    to improve their algorithms. However, these algorithms rely heavily on large amounts
    of training data. On one end, there are inputs such as consumer demographics,
    behaviors, and interests. On the other end, there are conversion events like purchases,
    which serve as outputs. Feeding the ad platforms with more conversion events can
    help them better identify the ideal customer profiles for you.

    more consumer data, such as browsing and purchasing behaviors across platforms.
    This provided more inputs and outputs for their algorithms to function well, even
    with little data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these privacy changes have significantly impacted ad platforms’ tracking
    capabilities and have resulted in reduced accuracy of their targeting. In real-world
    case studies, we have found that ad platforms that heavily rely on consumer behavior
    tracking are more affected by the changes than other platforms. As a result, these
    platforms’ budget allocations across market segments may not align with brands’
    business cases.

    It is not uncommon for ad platforms to allocate over 50% of ad spend to market

    target audience to achieve satisfactory advertising results. By specifying your
    target audience, you can narrow the search and testing scope of ad platforms’
    algorithms, shortening their learning phase and improving advertising performance.

    gender, income level, interests, favorite products, and other relevant factors.
    You can evaluate individual market segment breakdowns to determine if any segments
    outperform others.

    results. Even if they choose to broaden their target later on, their advertising
    performance remains at a high level because ad platforms have been trained for
    their business cases.

    brands can gain tremendous growth opportunities by simply cutting back budgets
    on initiatives that are not working. In our customers’ cases, we saw many such
    opportunities go unnoticed, especially when a brand invests heavily in marketing
    and has a large number of ad campaigns running.

    ignored. In many of our customers’ cases, we discovered profitable ads that deserved
    more investments. These promising signals were previously buried in the noises
    created by underperforming campaigns.

    profitable, three are mediocre, and five are far from profitable, you should focus
    on the two profitable campaigns, reduce spending on the five unprofitable campaigns,
    and investigate the three mediocre campaigns to see if there are any high-performing
    ads.

    immediately obvious. If over 50% of your ad campaigns are underperforming, you
    are unlikely to find actionable insights from your market segment breakdowns.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, you should first eliminate the marketing initiatives that are
    clearly underperforming and prioritize the high-performing ones according to step
    1, scaling back on unprofitable initiatives, and step 2, doubling down on high-performing
    ads. Once you reach a point where half of your ad campaigns are performing well,
    you can start analyzing market segment breakdowns to evaluate viable paths toward
    profitable advertising.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important to note that advertising performance data is often skewed due
    to outlier events. For instance, a high-value purchase from a specific customer
    can make the performance of that market segment appear favorable. However, such
    events may not be sustainable. Therefore, before making any changes based on good
    or bad signals in a market segment, you should check the time series of that segment
    to ensure those signals are consistent.

- en: The definition of consistency depends on the size of ad spend and the timing
    of the year. For example, if you are spending a small amount, make sure a trend
    is consistent for one or two weeks because performance can be volatile from day
    to day. Conversely, if you have high ad spend, a few days of ad performance is
    enough to tell the story.
  prefs: []

- en: Additionally, you should be cautious about promotional periods when evaluating
    trends. Many ads perform well during promotions, but cannot yield much return
    during regular times. Analyzing ad performance during non-promotional periods
    will provide an accurate picture of each market segment.

    have tested everything possible, don’t get frustrated. Instead, try to evaluate
    things from a data science perspective. We have worked with numerous brands that

    profitable advertising for them through data.
