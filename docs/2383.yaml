    what you will be working on during your internship. If you weren’t familiar with
    it after going through the interview process, research what the company does and
    the tools they use. If you have the information, it is best to reach out to your
    team members or your manager to get a grasp of the specifics of the tools you’ll
    be working on and the context of your problem. This is the best way to understand
    what you’ll be working on and prepare for those things.

- en: At the start of your internship, be sure to set your goals and intentions. Really
    think about the reasons why you are about to commit the following X number of
    months to this job. What do you want to get out of it? For example, you should
    understand what working in this particular industry, role, or company is like.
    Then, think of ways to achieve the things you set out to do. For example, if your
    goal is to identify the roles you want to work in, perhaps you could set up coffee
    chats with people on your team or in your company who work in different positions
    to get their perspectives. As an intern, you have more people and resources available
    to you than you would otherwise.

    and proactive communication. Regularly update your supervisor and team members
    on your progress, ensuring they know the tasks you have completed and any challenges
    you have encountered. You can establish yourself as a reliable and responsible
    team member by demonstrating transparency and professionalism.

    internship. When presenting your ideas or suggestions, clearly communicate the
    thought process that led you to a particular conclusion. This communication demonstrates
    your critical thinking abilities, analytical skills, and ability to make informed
    decisions — an essential quality for a valuable team member.

    and feelings on decisions. At stand-up meetings, I learned to explain my work
    concisely and not to undermine my hard work, even though it’s easy to feel insignificant
    as an intern. Through disagreeing with people at my company, I had to learn to
    communicate my perspective effectively and professionally. In hindsight, I think
    communication skills — explaining yourself and advocating for yourself — are critical
    to securing the return offer.

    Don’t hesitate to ask questions, especially in the early stages of your internship.
    Clarifying any uncertainties will enable you to perform your tasks more efficiently,
    demonstrate your commitment to the role, and show your eagerness to grow and improve.
    Remember that as an intern, you are primarily there to learn!

    beyond your core tasks. Offer assistance to your teammates, participate actively
    in team projects, and demonstrate your willingness to take on additional responsibilities.
    By showcasing your initiative and versatility, you display your value as an intern
    and highlight your potential as a valuable long-term team member. For example,
    I ran a team happy hour for my mentor (who was supposed to run it but was busy
    because of on-call duties). I volunteered to run this happy hour even though I
    was just the intern because I felt like I could do it without having even been
    to one and thought it could be interesting. Later, I learned that my manager noted
    the initiative I took in volunteering to host this happy hour and wrote about
    it in several of my feedback notes.

    demonstrates your engagement and active involvement in the team’s projects. Your
    contributions showcase your knowledge and creativity and highlight your commitment
    to the team’s success. What initially stopped me from participating in team meetings
    was the fear of sounding stupid because I did not feel like I had the knowledge
    or context to contribute. However, it’s admirable to contribute any ideas you
    have while admitting the potential holes in your understanding. These meetings
    are meant to be discussions anyways, and they did hire you for your opinions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “利用你的实习生头衔。”
- en: What?? You may think that being an intern puts you at the bottom of the totem
    pole. You’re a small fish in a big sea. While that’s true, being the “intern”
    can be an advantage when trying to learn. As an intern, there is more leniency
    regarding standards of work. You’re allowed to make mistakes.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 什么？？你可能认为作为一个实习生意味着你处于等级最低的位置。你是大海中的一条小鱼。虽然这是真的，但作为“实习生”在学习时可以是一种优势。作为实习生，对工作标准的要求更加宽松。你可以犯错。
- en: Additionally, it’s a lot easier to reach out to people you want to talk to.
    In almost all of my internships, I’ve had conversations with people high up in
    the company and even the CEOs because of my intern position. So don’t be afraid
    to reach out and introduce yourself as an intern who would love to chat!
  id: totrans-39
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 此外，联系你想交流的人会容易很多。在我几乎所有的实习中，由于实习生的身份，我都有机会与公司高层甚至首席执行官进行对话。所以不要害怕主动联系，介绍自己作为一个希望聊天的实习生！
- en: “It pays to be opinionated around here.”
  id: totrans-40

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “在这里，有观点是有好处的。”
- en: At one of my internships, one of my coworkers encouraged me to speak out based
    on their own experiences. They told me that having opinions and voicing them is
    how to succeed at this company. This quote really stuck around with me. I noticed
    how many of the people I admire or who are successful at work are very opinionated
    and vocal (while voicing their thoughts professionally). They can afford to be
    opinionated because they are not afraid to be wrong and simply admit it when they
    are wrong.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在我的一次实习中，一位同事鼓励我根据他们的经验表达意见。他们告诉我，拥有观点并且敢于表达才是成功的关键。这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。我注意到许多我敬佩的人或工作中成功的人都很有观点并且直言不讳（虽然他们以专业的方式表达自己的想法）。他们之所以能够有观点，是因为他们不怕犯错，并且在犯错时能够坦诚承认。
- en: ” What’s the point of this?”
  id: totrans-42

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “这有什么意义？”
- en: 'During one of my intern presentations, someone blurted out “What is the point
    of this?”. Initially, I was a little shocked at such a blunt question. On the
    one hand, this question can be seen as attacking and rude, almost as if they were
    telling me that my project had no purpose. On the other hand, there was genuine
    curiosity behind the question, which made me realize that I might not have explained
    the purpose of these decisions well. Thankfully, I knew exactly why I made the
    decisions I did and had good answers to their questions. After defining “the point”
    of “this,” the person understood what I was doing, and I felt like explaining
    the point of all my decisions was more fruitful to the discussion than had that
    person not asked that question. This experience taught me two main work lessons:
    know why you’re doing things really well and don’t take things personally.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在一次实习演讲中，有人突然问道：“这有什么意义？”起初，我对这样直接的问题感到有些震惊。一方面，这个问题似乎是在攻击和无礼，几乎像是在告诉我我的项目没有意义。另一方面，问题背后确实有真实的好奇心，这让我意识到我可能没有很好地解释这些决定的目的。幸运的是，我确切知道我做出这些决定的原因，并且对他们的问题有很好的回答。在阐明了“这个”的“意义”之后，那个人理解了我在做什么，我觉得解释我所有决定的意义对于讨论的成果要比那个人没有提出这个问题要更加有成效。这次经历教会了我两个主要的工作经验：清楚你做事的真正原因，并且不要把事情个人化。

    tips, you can position yourself as an exceptional intern and increase your likelihood

    the decisions made, especially when they’re made due to economic fluctuations
