- en: The Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers that are
    based on applying Bayes’ theorem with naive assumption on independence between
    the features.

- en: These classifiers are extremely fast both in training and prediction, and they
    are also highly scalable and interpretable. Despite their oversimplified assumptions,
    they often work well on complex real-world problems, especially in text classification
    tasks such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis, where their naive assumption
    largely holds.

- en: Naive Bayes is also one of the earliest **generative models** (long before ChatGPT…),which
    learn the distribution of the inputs in each class. These models can be used not
    only for prediction but also for generating new samples (see [this article](https://medium.com/@roiyeho/generative-vs-discriminative-models-35b81f677822)
    for in-depth discussion on generative vs. discriminative models).

    and then show how to use its implementation in Scikit-Learn to solve a document
    classification task.
