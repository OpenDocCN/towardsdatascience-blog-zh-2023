- en: Maybe like you, over the last years I have attended many events about the past,
    present and future of Artificial Intelligence. AI pioneer and DeepMind co-founder
    [Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis) was a speaker in
    one of them in Oviedo, Spain. In that moment, little did I know about his brilliant
    career and fascinating experiments with AlphaFold.

- en: I view Demis Hassabis as an archetype of a modern computer scientist. A professional
    that displays creativity and imagination in addition to logic, abstract thinking
    and engineering skills. Current predominant tech culture is driven by “[deterministic
    thinking](https://zephoria.medium.com/resisting-deterministic-thinking-52ef8d78248c).”
    Visions are polarized. The future feels binary with serious utopian and dystopian
    thinking swirling simultaneously. In contrast, Demis talks about AI with nuances;
    he is aware of what other disciplines bring, and he can articulate how his work
    plays a role in the co-evolution between society and technology. I left the event
    inspired.

    of my generation of computer scientists. The “Principles of a modern computer
    scientist” that the younger generation now at school could use as a blueprint
    for their future practice. Some of these principles might look like this.

- en: Logic and abstract thinking are essential, but they can limit whatever challenge
    into a narrow, finite solution. Imagination is a differential ingredient of the
    modern computer scientist capable of exploring the broadest range of possibilities.

- en: With its “sprints,” “accelerators,” and “agile methodology,” the language in
    the tech world has sacralized optimization and fast execution. In contrast, modern
    computer scientists take pride in identifying the potential consequences of their
    work. And that takes time and patience.

- en: The practice of computer science is not limited to following well structured
    iterative processes. Modern computer scientists look at challenges through multiple
    perspectives. They use creativity to think first. They build experiments and prototypes
    in safe environments to create multiple paths to choose from.

    by doubt. They know how to listen to and challenge convictions. Their mission
    is to synthesize those convictions into nuanced conclusions.
