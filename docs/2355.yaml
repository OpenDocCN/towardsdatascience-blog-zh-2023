    we introduced social network analysis and basic concepts like nodes and edges.
    In [Part 2](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/visualizing-social-networks-for-better-insights-analyzing-and-mapping-social-relationships-with-f4a9cf6b6d57),
    we expanded our understanding of social network analysis by graphing the relationships
    between the members of the bands [Smashing Pumpkins](https://smashingpumpkins.com/)
    and [Zwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwan). Then, we examined metrics like
    degree centrality and betweenness centrality to investigate the relationships
    between the members of the different bands. At the same time, we discussed how
    domain knowledge helps to inform our understanding of the results.'

    we introduced a third centrality measure, [closeness centrality](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/closeness-centrality/).
    We also began a discussion on the concept of communities and subgroups and demonstrated
    different community graphs and how we might use closeness centrality to inform
    our interpretation. Using the network of musicians that were members of the bands
    Zwan and Smashing Pumpkins, we made inferences about the relationships between
    the members.
