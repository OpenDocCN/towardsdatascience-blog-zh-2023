- en: Somewhere in an uncharted galaxy, you and your friend are being held prisoners
    by an enigmatic group of extraterrestrial beings. They promise to let you go if
    you beat them in one of their games. You sit at a cosmic table with one of the
    aliens who distributes bags containing both a black and a white rock. When the
    game starts, every player will select a rock and put it on the table. The winner
    is whoever picks the rock with a different color. This means, whoever chooses
    black when the other two choose white or whoever chooses white when the other
    two choose black. Every time someone wins, they will give you a coin to pile up
    on your side of the table. You will play the game a million times, and the ultimate
    winner is the one with more coins at the end. Besides the rules of the game, the
    only other information you have is that the alien always plays black with a 50%
    probability. Seconds before the game starts, your partner whispers the strategy
    you should follow. After a million games, the final score declares both of you
    as the winners. Was this pure luck? How important was your partner’s strategy?
