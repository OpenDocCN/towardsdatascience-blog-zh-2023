- en: Most developers hate legacy software, why? “Legacy” in our industry means a
    codebase that has been in service for many years, usually the original developers
    are no longer in the company, and nobody is able to really maintain it.

- en: 'Some important ingredients in the legacy software recipe are: lack of documentation,
    hard-to-understand code, difficulty in **trying out modifications**, and serious
    difficulty in **building software for shipment**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, legacy software is called like that because the company relies on it,
    and that is why it is still in use despite the fact that most developers do not
    know how to handle it. We inherit it from our past colleagues, and it becomes
    our duty to keep it working in the future like it did in the past.

- en: Yet, there is software that respects the abovementioned requirements for legacy
    software without having the pro side of having serviced us for years. Part of
    that code is also quite recent. That means, people write code that is already
    “legacy” according to its negative definitions.
