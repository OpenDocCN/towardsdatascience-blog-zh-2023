  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal to derive a score may formulate this as a regression problem, where
    each data point or feature is used to predict a target variable, in this scenario,
    a numerical score. This requires the target variable to be available in some instances
    for training the predictive model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as we don’t have a target variable to start with, we may need to approach
    this problem in another way. For instance, under the assumption that each geographic
    areas is different from a socio-economic standpoint, can we aim to understand
    which data points help explain the most variations, thereby deriving a score based
    on a numerical combination of these data points.
  prefs: []

    14 data points (features) to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1\. This is
    primarily to ensure the loadings assigned to each feature by PCA (think of them
    as indicators of how important a feature is) are comparable across features. Otherwise,
    more emphasis, or higher loading, may be given to a feature which is actually
    not significant or vice versa.
