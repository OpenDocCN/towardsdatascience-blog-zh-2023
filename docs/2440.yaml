    difficult relationships between features and outcomes that cannot be easily hard
    coded as heuristics or if-else statements. However, there are some limitations
    or things to have in mind when deciding if ML is a good solution for a given problem
    at hand. In this post we’ll deep dive into the topic **“to use or not to use ML,”**
    first understanding this for “traditional” ML models, and afterwards discussing
    how this picture is changing with the progress of Generative AI.

    it needs to predict (in this example, sentiment from a comment). If data has low
    quality (a lot of typos, missing data, errors…), it will be really hard for the
    model to perform well.

- en: Similarly, you need to have enough volume of data for the model to learn the
    different casuistry that impact whatever needs to be predicted. In this example,
    if you only have a case of negative comment label with concepts like “useless”,
    “disappointed” or similar, the model won’t be able to learn that these words usually
    appear when the label is “negative.”
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Enough volume of training data should also help ensure you have a good representation
    of the data you will need to perform predictions on. For example, if your training
    data has no representation of a particular geographical area or a particular segment
    of the population, it is more likely the model will fail to perform well for those
    comments at prediction time.
  id: totrans-20

    we are able to compute relevant lagging features or labels (e.g. “customer pays
    the credit during the next year or not”).

  id: totrans-23

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The definition of the label is key. In this example, our label would be the
    sentiment associated with the comment. We could think we only can have “positive”
    or “negative” comments, and then argue we might have “neutral” comments as well.
    In this case from a given comment, it will usually be clear if the label needs
    to be “positive”, “neutral” or “negative”. But imagine we had the labels “very
    positive”, “positive”, “neutral”, “negative” or “very negative”… For a given comment,
    would it be that easy to decide if it is “positive” or “very positive”? This lack
    of clear definition of the label needs to be avoided, as training with a noisy
    label will make it harder for the model to learn.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that the definition of the label is clear, we need to be able to get this
    label for a sufficient and quality set of examples, which will form our training
    data. In our example, we could consider manually tagging a set of comments, be
    it within the company or team, be it externalizing the tagging to professional
    annotators (yes, there are people working full time labelling dataset for ML!).
    Costs and feasibility associated with the obtention of these labels needs to be
    considered.

    run it offline and exploiting the predictions would be quite simple. However,
    if we wanted to automatically respond to a negative comment in the next 5 minutes
    it is published, this would be another story: the model would need to be deployed
    and integrated to make this possible. Overall, it is important to have a clear
    idea of what the requirements to use the predictions will be, to ensure it will
    be feasible with the team and tools available.'

    errors to happen, then it might not be a good idea to use ML. In our example,
    imagine instead of comments and sentiment, we were using the model to classify
    emails from customers into “pressing charges or not”. It wouldn’t be a good idea
    to have a model that can misclassify an email that is pressing charges against
    the company due to the terrible consequences this might have for the company.

    sense from an ethical perspective. You can check my previous [blog post](https://medium.com/glovo-engineering/ml-bias-intro-risks-and-solutions-to-discriminatory-predictive-models-9335b7709818)

    volume of data they use. Thanks to these models, it might be the case (again,
    for very specific use cases), that we no longer need training data. This is known
    as zero-shot learning (e.g. *“ask ChatGPT what is the sentiment of a given comment”*)
    and few-shot learning (e.g. *“provide some examples of positive, neutral and negative
    comments to ChatGPT, then ask it to provide the sentiment for a new comment”*).
