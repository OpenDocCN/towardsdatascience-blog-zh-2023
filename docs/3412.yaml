    the realm of natural language processing (NLP) — the wide range of machine learning
    tasks that leverage textual data for prediction, classification, and recommendation
    tools.

- en: The rise of large language models has introduced a host of exciting new possibilities
    into the field, with novel use cases and innovative workflows popping up at a
    rapid clip. Our highlights this week represent a wide cross-section of concepts
    and approaches that dig deeper into this emerging area. From prompt engineering
    to text-to-image and text-to-speech applications, we’re thrilled to share work
    by authors who explore the creative possibilities of textual data as both inputs
    and outputs of these powerful models. Let’s dive in.
