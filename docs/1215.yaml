- en: Having spent a lot of time researching causal inference I began to realise that
    I did not have a full grasp of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and that this was
    hampering my efforts to develop my understanding to a point where I could apply
    it in order to solve real-world problems.

    everything you need to know about DAGs in order to take your understanding of
    Causal Inference to the next level.
