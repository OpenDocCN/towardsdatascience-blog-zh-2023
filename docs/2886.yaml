- en: In recent overviews, we have explored the utility of augmenting large language
    models (LLMs) with external tools. These models can be taught to leverage tools
    in a variety of ways. However, we should realize that existing tool-following
    LLMs leverage only a limited set of potential tools [3], *whereas the range of
    problems we want to solve with LLMs is nearly endless!* With this in mind, it
    becomes clear that such a paradigm is limiting — we will always be able to find
    scenarios that require tools that do not yet exist. In this overview, we will
    explore recent research that aims to solve this problem by providing LLMs with
    the skills to create their own tools. Such an approach draws an interesting analogy
    to human life, as the ability to fabricate tools led to major technological advancements.
    Now, we explore the impact of similar techniques upon the evolution of LLMs.

    a crucial turning point was that humans got the ability to fabricate their own
    tools to address emerging challenges. We embark on an initial exploration to apply
    this evolutionary concept to the realm of LLMs.” *— from [1]*
