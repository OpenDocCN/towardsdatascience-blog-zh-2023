    basis, but Python, for all its frequently cited shortcomings (speed, anyone?),
    remains one of the main unifiers of data and ML practitioners around the world.
    Scroll down the TDS homepage on any given day, and you’ll find it impossible to
    contest the programming language’s ubiquity and versatility.

    not be familiar with yet, we’ve gathered a selection of recent Python-focused
    tutorials we found particularly well executed. They cover a lot of ground, so
    regardless of your role or background, you’re likely to find a new topic or workflow
    to explore. Happy learning!
