    years of iteration. The most successful teams follow a *feedback loop* while developing
    a product. First, they develop an idea, deploy it to production, and monitor the
    process. Then, based on the data collected, they analyse and determine whether
    it‚Äôs successful. The insights gained in the analysis inform the next iteration
    of development. Fran√ßois Chollet, the creator of Keras, [calls this the loop of
    progress [2].](https://fchollet.substack.com/p/the-loop-of-progress)
