- en: How do we know if artificial intelligences are unfeeling algorithms or conscious
    beings that experience sensations and emotions? The answer to this has major implications
    on what ethical guidelines we apply to AIs. If we believe that a future AI experiences
    pain and joy, we’d treat it differently than we’d treat a simple algorithm like
    an Excel formula. Can we know what an AI is experiencing? Theories of consciousness
    aim to say what leads to consciousness and could help determine if AIs, animals,
    or even trees are conscious.

    (IIT), is unique in that it comes with an equation for calculating how conscious
    any given thing is. A human brain scores very high while a pile of rocks scores
    zero. Electronic circuits from your kitchen lights to ChatGPT can have a wide
    range of scores. Regarding the latter and other artificial intelligences, IIT
    makes an interesting prediction: AIs built from complex, looping architectures
    will have at least some consciousness while those from linear, feedforward networks
    (ChatGPT included) will have zero consciousness.'

- en: If this theory can be proven true, it will be immensely useful for the future
    of AI ethics, not to mention for understanding human consciousness. Already, the
    theory is being used to predict if a patient in a vegetative state is truly unconscious
    or merely locked-in, unable to move yet perceptive of their surroundings. However,
