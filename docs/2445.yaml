- en: For decades, men’s tennis has been synonymous with its dominant big three —
    Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. It has been a unique era in tennis,
    as it would in any other sport, with arguably three of its most successful players
    of all time playing together in one generation. Between them, the big three (shown
    in green below) have won 65 of the 82 Grand Slam tournaments since 2003.

    and Novak’s recent loss to Carlos Alcaraz in an epic Wimbledon final, the passing
    of the torch seems to be well underway.

- en: As tennis begins to imagine a world without its big three, fans and experts
    have been wondering if any player could have a career as decorated as Roger, Rafa,
    or Novak again, winning more than 20 Grand Slams. A year or two ago, it would
    have been silly to even think such a thing, let alone ask it out loud.

- en: With the incredible rise of 20-year-old world number one Carlos Alcaraz, the
    tennis world has had to stop and reconsider. It is less controversial to entertain
    that thought today. As a tennis fan, you will likely have seen plenty of commentary
    and media coverage comparing Carlos with the big three. However, few, if any,
    of these discussions have compared Carlos’ performances to this point, with the
    big three at a similar early stage in their career. Comparing Carlos’ level in
    his 10th Grand Slam main draw appearance with Novak’s in his 71st, although exciting
    to do, is not a complete picture.

- en: As a tennis fan and a data professional, I have been eager to see more of an
    apples-to-apples comparison, comparing player performances at similar points in
    their careers. Fortunately, it was possible to do such an analysis thanks to all
    the great work Jeff Sackmann has done in making tour-level ATP match data available
    via his [tennis_atp](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) GitHub repository.
    This repository and, more broadly, his [GitHub](https://github.com/JeffSackmann)
    are great resources for anyone interested in tennis analytics. Separately, you
    can find all the Python code used for the analysis and visuals in this article
    on my [GitHub](https://github.com/asawhney27/Tennis-Analytics).

    develop a more nuanced perspective on how Carlos’ early career compares with the
    big three’s.

    two most sought-after tournament categories, and broaden the comparison to include
    the [top ten players](https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankRange=0-100&rankDate=2023-07-17)instead
    of limiting it to just Carlos. This will help provide added context and perspective
    to the performances.

    Slams and Masters 1000 tournaments won by the big three and today’s top ten ranked
    players (as of July 17th, 2023).

    the path Roger, Rafa, and Novak took to get to where they are.

    the y-axis represents the number of Masters 1000 tournaments won. The higher the
    player trendline at a certain point, the better the performance to that point.

    each member of the trio playing more than 120 Masters 1000 tournaments and winning
    well over 20 titles a piece. For this discussion, however, let us zoom into the
    bottom left quadrant highlighted above,focusing on comparing two standout players
    with the big three.

    in 42 tournaments, he is currently slightly ahead of where Novak was at this stage
    and tied with Roger.'

    coming in just his 7th appearance, Carlos was quicker out of the gate than each
    of the big three. After playing 16 Masters 1000 tournaments, he is tied at the
    top with Rafa at four titles and well ahead of Novak (2) and Roger (0) at a similar

    at a tournament level for Grand Slams is quite limited for players early in their

    has been going. After 44 Grand Slam matches, Carlos shares the top spot with Rafa
    at 36 wins and will be alone at the top if he wins his first-round match at the
    US Open later this year.

- en: From the data above, it is clear that Carlos Alcaraz is an absolute phenom.
    His case is even more compelling if we consider age as a factor. Let us take a
    look at the number of Masters 1000s and Grand Slam tournaments each of these players
    had won before turning 25.

    and four Masters 1000s at just 20, Carlos has a long runway ahead.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, as with most all-time greats, what is truly special about the big three
    is how long they have been as great as they have. If Carlos can remain healthy
    and continue to be as dominant as he is today while the x-axes in these charts
    extend out tournament after tournament, year after year, the big three might have
    to make some room.
