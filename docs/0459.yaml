    worthwhile to note that there are **trade-offs** between a *stronger statistical
    power* and a *longer experiment period* if we want to detect more subtle incremental
    lifts (small **ùëëùëöùëñùëõ).** Therefore, when designing A/B experiments, we often compute
    multiple versions of sample sizes under different levels of **ùëëùëöùëñùëõ** to quantify
    the trade-offs.

    metrics, we don‚Äôt need to input the standard deviation.** This is because the
    proportional metric such as conversion rate can be viewed as an aggregation of
    the conversion statuses for all the users. And since a **user is either converted
    or not converted**, which in statistical language, is a **random Bernoulli event**
    denoted as *Bernoulli(p)*. Therefore, the analytical variance estimate for the
    conversion rate is **ùëù‚àó(1-ùëù)**. What this nice property implies is that we don‚Äôt
    ‚Äúneed‚Äù to input the standard deviation to calculate the minimum sample size because
    we could always estimate the true analytical standard deviation using the sample
    average conversion rate **ùëù**, which is the **baseline conversion rate**, as phrased
    in the input box of Evan‚Äôs calculator.
