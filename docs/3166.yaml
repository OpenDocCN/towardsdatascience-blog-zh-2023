    around the term *change management*, but they might as well have been speaking
    different languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alex, our CDO, thinks big. She’s monitoring market shifts, emerging technologies,
    and envisioning where the company should be in a few years. However, the strategy
    is the easy part, what is complicated is to get everyone on the same page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Introducing a new tool? She’s got to be ready for the eye-rolls and the “not
    another software to learn” groans. A new process? Brace for the “but we’ve always
    done it this way” chorus. For Alex, change management is a tightrope walk — balancing
    where the company needs to go with making sure everyone’s on board and not panicking
    about their job security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then there’s Jamie. His change management isn’t about years down the road; it’s
    about, well, right now. That pipeline that just broke? His problem. A discrepancy
    in the sales report? His responsibility. The hardest part is not always the technicalities
    but often the human element. Like when someone forgets to tell him about a tiny
    “insignificant” data change that sends everything into a spiral. Or when a task
    goes wrong, and the blame game starts. For Jamie, change management is about keeping
    things running smoothly today and dealing with whatever curveballs come his way.

- en: I often interact with CDOs, and the diversity of conversations is an aspect
    of my job I truly appreciate. Every conversation is different, bringing its unique
    perspectives. Yet, for some reason — maybe because these topics are ones I care
    deeply about, or perhaps this is where the real action is — certain common themes
    inevitably surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First and foremost, there’s this passionate emphasis on **driving business value**.
    It’s not just about collecting data or implementing the fanciest new tech; it’s
    about turning that data into actionable insights. It’s about ensuring that every
    data-driven initiative ties back to the company’s goals, be it increasing sales,
    improving customer satisfaction, or optimising operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next up is the push for **efficiency**. CDOs frequently face the task of improving
    operations, cutting out overlaps, and making sure data reaches where it’s needed
    promptly. This isn’t a walk in the park; it involves dismantling old barriers,
    encouraging teamwork, and staying updated with new tech solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of the more ambitious directions many CDOs are leaning towards is the concept
    of **decentralisation** or a *data mesh*. It’s a significant shift from the traditional
    centralised data teams to a model where domain teams own, produce, and serve their
    data as products. The thought process here is simple yet revolutionary: those
    who know the data best should package and maintain it. This not only ensures better
    data quality but also fosters a culture of self-consumption, giving more autonomy
    to different parts of the organisation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reaching these goals is tough. Each strategic aim presents change management
    issues that CDOs like Alex must directly address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take the business value first agenda, for instance. For data professionals who
    have spent years, if not decades, entrenched in technical tasks, shifting the
    focus towards business outcomes can be jarring. They’ve been hardwired to think
    in terms of data accuracy, system integrations, and code optimizations. Asking
    them to “think in terms of business value” is often met with a puzzled look!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Then there is the move towards decentralisation, arguably a great idea on paper:
    empower teams, let them take ownership, and the organisation becomes more agile
    and efficient. In practice, this means a lot of change and this needs to be managed.
    With decentralisation comes the challenge of clearly defining roles and responsibilities.
    When everyone is a stakeholder, it is easy for tasks to fall through the cracks.
    Who is responsible for data quality? Who ensures that data is accessible to those
    who need it? Without clear delineations, balls get dropped, and the blame game
    begins.'

- en: In essence, for each strategic pivot, there’s an underlying web of change management
    intricacies. It’s not just about charting the course, but ensuring that everyone
    on board understands their role, is equipped to play their part, and is committed
    to the journey ahead.

- en: While Alex’s role as a CDO is largely about the bigger picture, navigating through
    broad, unpredictable scenarios, there’s another side to change management. It’s
    found in the daily, detailed challenges faced by data engineers like Jamie. In
    their realm, *change management* isn’t about long-term strategy or overarching
    business aims. Instead, it focuses on the ongoing, every-moment hurdles of ensuring
    data remains consistent and accessible in a constantly shifting backdrop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Primarily, the bulk of data in organisations emerges as a byproduct. As various
    business activities unfold, data naturally accumulates, much like exhaust from
    a machine. However, while this data might be a mere byproduct for those generating
    it, for data teams and their internal and external customers downstream, it becomes
    central to their daily operations. Ironically, at the source, there’s often little
    regard for this ‘exhaust’, even though it’s indispensable for these stakeholders
    further along the chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think of it as trying to set the foundation for a towering building on unstable
    ground. The earth below is always moving, but you’re tasked with ensuring the
    immense structure above stays steady. This is the world for many data engineers
    and BI analysts. They stand at the front, handling the erratic behaviour of data
    every single day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A significant issue they face is the complex network of dependencies that weave
    through the data world. Data moves from one platform to another, undergoes transformation,
    merges with other datasets, and finally reaches its intended place. Every stage
    of this process holds the potential for glitches. A minor adjustment in one platform
    can ripple and cause disruptions elsewhere. And the most challenging aspect? Often
    those making these changes are oblivious to the potential chain reactions they
    might set off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Facing day-to-day problems with changing data chains led thought leaders to
    devise new concepts. They first introduced *data products*, which packaged data
    for ease of consumption, akin to how a shop owner presents goods to customers.
    But as more people started using these data products, there arose a need for formal
    commitments — a way to ensure data product owners reliably served their users.
    This realisation spurred the development of *data contracts* to ensure these obligations
    were met.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Data contracts act as a bridge between the people who package data for consumption
    and the consumers they serve, documenting and enforcing clear commitments: immutability
    of the data schemas, standards of quality and of availability, and so on. They
    address quite elegantly the question of managing change in chains of dependencies
    in data.'

    might seem worlds apart at first glance. A CDO like Alex grapples with guiding
    the overarching strategy and aligning the entire organisation towards a shared
    vision. Meanwhile, Jamie is the firefighter dealing with day-to-day data challenges.
    Yet, at the core of both these perspectives, lie some unifying principles that
    can bridge the divide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    goals of a strategic initiative or Jamie flagging a potential downstream impact
    of a schema change, clear and open communication can prevent many issues.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Collaboration ensures alignment**. Everyone in the data organisation needs
    to be in sync. On a daily level, this means communicating effectively to prevent
    unforeseen hiccups. Strategically, it’s about ensuring everyone is clear on the
    broader goals, ensuring both daily tasks and overarching plans push in the same
    direction'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Standardisation offers stability**. Introducing practices like data contracts
    not only addresses the nitty-gritty challenges Jamie faces but also fortifies
    the foundation upon which Alex’s strategic vision is built. By establishing clear
    standards, we remove ambiguities and make it easier for both the big-picture thinkers
    and the detail-oriented doers to cohesively move in the same direction.'

- en: The final irony is that in order to address the day-to-day problems of Jamie
    (the unintended consequences of changes in opaque chains of dependency), you need
    to make this topic a strategic priority.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you want to be successful, given the amount of process, human and technological
    change, you need to apply all the good principles of change management as advocated
    by Alex. Of course, Jamie has a critical role to play here, he is the one closest
    to the problem and its consequences, so he can become a change agent, getting
    his colleagues and his management on board.
