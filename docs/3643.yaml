- en: In classical statistics, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) can be approached through
    the lens of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Both MLE and OLS aim to find
    the best parameters for a model, but they come from different philosophies and
    use different methods to achieve this.

    what are the most likely parameters of the model that could have generated this
    data?” MLE assumes a certain probability distribution for the errors (often a
    normal distribution) and then finds the parameter values that maximize the likelihood
    of observing the actual data. In the geometric visual, this is akin to adjusting
    the angle and position of the plane (colX) in such a way that the probability
    of seeing the actual data points (y) is the highest. The likelihood incorporates
    not just the distances from the points to the plane (the errors) but also the
    shape of the error distribution.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, ML approaches typically frame regression as an optimization
    problem. The goal is to find the parameters that minimize some objective function,
    which is usually the sum of squared errors (SSE). This is more of a direct approach
    than MLE, as it doesn’t make as many assumptions about the underlying probability
    distribution of the errors. It simply tries to make the distance from the data
    points to the predicted plane as small as possible, in a squared sense to penalize
    larger errors more severely. The geometric interpretation is that you’re tilting
    and moving the plane (colX) to minimize the sum of the squares of the perpendicular
    distances (the dotted lines) from the actual points (y) to the plane.

  id: totrans-49
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the procedures differ — one being a probability-based method and the
    other an optimization technique — they often yield the same result in the case
    of OLS. This is because when the errors are normally distributed, the MLE for
    the coefficients of a linear model leads to the same equations as minimizing the
    sum of squared errors. In the visual, both methods are effectively trying to position
    the same plane in the space of the variables X1 and X2 such that it best represents
    the relationship with y.
  id: totrans-50
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main difference is in interpretation and potential generalization. MLE’s
    framework allows for more flexibility in modeling the error structure and can
    be extended to models where errors are not assumed to be normally distributed.
    The ML approach is typically more straightforward and computationally direct,
    focusing solely on the sum of the squared differences without concerning itself
    with the underlying probability distribution.
  id: totrans-51
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, while MLE and ML minimization approaches might arrive at the same
    coefficients for an OLS regression, they are conceptually distinct. MLE is probabilistic
    and rooted in the likelihood of observing the data under a given model, while
    ML minimization is algorithmic, focusing on the direct reduction of error. The
    geometric visual remains the same for both, but the rationale behind the position
    of the plane differs.

    a feature in our model, and L1 regularization tries to minimize the number of
    folds. In the end, you’ll have a blanket that fits the bed well but might not
    get into every nook and cranny, especially if those are just noise. In the geometric
    visual, Lasso would try to keep the plane (colX) well-fitted to the points but
    might flatten out in the direction of less important variables (shrinking coefficients
    to zero).'

- en: '**With Ridge (L2):** This is like wanting a snug fit but also wanting the blanket
    to be evenly spread out without any part being too far from the bed. So even though
    the blanket still fits the bed closely, it won’t get overly contorted to fit the
    minor bumps. In the geometric visual, Ridge adds a penalty that constrains the
    coefficients, shrinking them towards zero but not exactly to zero. This keeps
    the plane close to the points but prevents it from tilting too sharply to fit
    any particular points too closely, thus maintaining a bit of a distance (bias)
