    applying the fertiliser to the entire field you could divide the field into squares.
    For each square you flip a coin and based upon the outcome either apply fertiliser
    or not. In doing so you have randomised whether or not you apply fertiliser and
    therefore removed any factors which may bias your choice. Additionally, since
    you are working within the same field, confounders such as the weather are controlled
    for and cannot bias the results. You can then simply compare the crop yield of
    treated squares to those which are untreated gaining you the treatment effect.

    relationships learnt from the data. This is incredibly powerful as it allows you
    to easily create “what-if” scenarios by intervening in the model. Intervening
    simply means changing the value of a node within the graph. The SCM then describes
    how this change would flow through to the other variables, and eventually the
    treatment. The result is that with a representative SCM you can begin to explore
    a huge range of different scenarios, and compare the impact of different actions.

    This area of the map encompasses the burgeoning number of techniques which go
    beyond treatment effect estimation. To provide an illustration of the types of
    methods contained with the desert let’s consider [algorithmic recourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06278).

    explanations. Counterfactual explanations pose the question; what would have had
    to be changed in order for the outcome to be different?

    that a customer will churn. A counterfactual explanation to help explain why this
    person is likely churn could be: if they were a senior customer aged 65 or over,
    they would renew.'

    with a focus on providing you with the ability to act, rather than simply understand.
    Therefore, algorithmic recourse provides the ability to recommend actions in order
    to change unfavourable outcomes, allowing you to intervene in the system to prevent
    them.

    to an actionable recommendation. Applying recourse to prevent this person from
    churning: if they received a 10% discount, they would renew. As discounts are
    something which can be acted upon this allows you to affect change in the real
    world.'
