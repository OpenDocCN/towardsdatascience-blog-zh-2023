    where the task is to build a system from deterministic blocks, feasibility of
    the problems tackled by machine learning projects is often unknown beforehand
    – will we have enough data, will the data be of reasonable quality, will the model
    be large enough to capture the relationships, will we have enough compute power?

    establishing itself, and there are no out of the box solutions to every problem,
    machine learning models need to be built from scratch. Hence, machine learning
    projects end up being research-oriented. For these projects predicting timeframes
    can be difficult, as many decisions can only be made once a certain phase has
    been completed.

    Some problems have a clear goal — for example, evaluating a spam filter, we can
    objectively tell that it filters out 99% of spam messages, while for more subjective
    problems, it is harder to define performance metrics. Consider, for example, a
    beautification filter — how can we measure if it performs well without a user
    study? And obtaining sufficient amounts of reliable data from the users is often
    [costly, slow and challenging](https://mimoiq.com/challenges-in-survey-data-collection/),
    especially with tight GDPR requirements.
