    in a certain context. Or make spelling errors. Or phrase awkwardly. Or use overly
    complicated or excessively long sentences. Or overly long paragraphs. Or ramble
    on excessively.

    he wrote. I read hundreds of his pages. Didn’t find a single article.

    writeups such as emails.

    posts, textual issues of course will be much more prolific. This is why we have
    copy editors, whose responsibilities include proofreading and editing content.

- en: This is also why NLP-based tools such as Grammarly are becoming increasingly
    popular. These tools can help one find and correct such errors within a matter
    of minutes in short texts such as emails. On longer texts, they’ll likely find
    more, which of course means they will take more time to fix.
