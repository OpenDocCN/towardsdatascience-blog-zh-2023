- en: In my 10 years of tenure in working with data in any capacity, I’ve noticed
    how much focus there is in learning quantitative techniques in order to do data
    analysis. I have spent thousands of hours perfecting my knowledge of everything
    from statistics to machine learning to economics and beyond. However, I found
    very little guidance in the strategic approach to answering business questions
    by using data analysis. I have also encountered many junior analysts who frequently
    mistake data analysis for its quantitative techniques, disregarding the fact that
    analysis is a powerful way of thinking and a great problem solving tool — i.e.
    data analysis is not just a product of its methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this multi-part series, I hope to do a data analysis primer that will provide
    a structured approach to using analysis in order to answer business questions.
    In Part 1, I will introduce data analysis and the four types of questions that
    it can help answer. This can be used as guidance for identifying analysis questions
    correctly. In the following posts, I will propose a strategy for answering each
    type of question and a methodology for selecting the correct techniques. I hope
    you find this guide useful — let me know in the comments!

- en: So what is data analysis and what is it trying to achieve? In general, analysis
    is a process of understanding some complex information by breaking it down into
    smaller and simpler pieces and understanding those pieces first. This process
    is used to help solve problems or answer questions. As in the general case, *data*
    analysis is a process of understanding something about complex *data* by trying
    to understand more manageable information about it.
  prefs: []

- en: Analysts can perform an array of techniques in order to do data analysis. For
    instance, if we are working with a medical facility manager and they ask us to
    describe their typical patients, we use statistical methods like taking the mean
    or calculating the range to describe the patient population. Thus, we can understand
    all of the clinic’s patients with just a few simpler statistics that describe
    them in aggregate. The question requires us to understand data which is complex
    in size and we can do so by understanding something less complex about it.

- en: Data analysis is “a process and practice of analyzing data to answer questions,
    extract insights, and identify trends” [1]. However, although data analysis requires
    techniques borrowed from statistics, machine learning, mathematics, and other
    disciplines, data analysts are not statisticians, data scientists, or mathematicians.
    While data scientists should understand a lot about the topic they are working
    with, they don’t have to be professional experts in that topic. The goal for data
    analysts is to be familiar enough with various techniques and be experts in applying
    them properly in order to generate insights and recommendations and enable business
    partners to make better, data-informed decisions. But you don’t have to be a Data
    Analyst to do data analysis and anyone familiar with the quantitative techniques
    and data analysis strategies can use them to help deliver data-informed decisions.

- en: 'Nearly all of the questions that require data analysis fall into four main
    categories: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. Some questions
    pertain to known values and variables (like descriptive and diagnostic questions);
    some questions are more hypothetical than concrete (like diagnostic and prescriptive
    questions). Answering these questions requires critical thinking, creative problem
    solving, and logical reasoning. However, if we are able to categorize a question
    that requires data analysis, we can develop a strategy for answering that question,
    based on its category. Therefore, it is necessary to be familiar with the types
    of questions and with the strategies on how to approach them.'

    This can include description of a population, relationship between different variables,
    or various trends. These types of questions are generally the easiest to identify
    — they typically refer to the present state or the past and generally start with
    a “what” or “is/does/did” keywords. Since not all descriptive questions begin
    with those keywords, another way to identify descriptive questions is to check
    if the question keyword can be rephrased to start with “what”. Some examples of
    these questions include:'

    revenue. As mentioned before, all of these questions can be restated to start
    with “what” or “is”: “are temperature of air and temperature of sea water related?”
    is the same question as “is there a relationship between air and sea water temperature?”
    and “how frequently do clients cancel their subscriptions?” is the same as “what
    is the frequency of client subscription cancelations?”.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Diagnostic questions aim to understand why something has happened or how something
    came about and attempt to assess dependence between variables. These questions
    lead with “why” and its synonym keywords (“how come”, “what caused”, etc) and
    refer to an event that already took place or is taking place currently.

- en: 'The key about diagnostic questions is that they require analysts to come up
    with potential reasons and verify if those reasons are correct. This is quite
    intuitive and is how most people try to diagnose a root cause of something. Typically,
    the dependent variable in question has changed and we want to know why. We can
    also think about diagnostic questions as “cause and effect” questions where the
    “cause” is unknown. Some examples of diagnostic questions are:'

    to identify a known effect and an uknown cause, we are probably working with a
    diagnostic question.

- en: Predictive questions aim to identify unknown values in a known or unknown variable.
    The values we want to predict may pertain to variables that are partially known
    and entirely unknown. For example, in predicting future sales, the “sales” variable
    is partially known (we have values for current or past sales); in client segmentation,
    “client segments” is a variable that is entirely unknown and we must rely on other
    features or information to imply values for a new variable.

    and decisions or to assess their preparedness for the future state. Predictive
    questions are typically posed to look for unknown information but unlike descriptive
    questions, the answer is always uncertain. Some examples of predictive questions

    are dealing with something partially or entirely unknown. The question “how can
    we group household plants according to their physical characteristics?” has nothing
    to do with future tense but wants to solve for an unkown parameter of household
    plants. The question “how many likes will our Instagram post get?” most likely
    pertains to a partially unknown variable: we probably have information regarding
    the number of likes our other instagram posts received but the number of likes
    *this specific* post will receive is unknown.'

    decision is made [3]. In that sense, the decision maker asking the question wants
    to acquire a recommendation based on a set of predictive outcomes. Generally,
    these questions are phrased in one of two ways: “what will happen if…” or “what
    should be done so that…”.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prescriptive questions take predictive questions one step further by assessing
    how a change in current situation will lead to a specific outcome or by identifying
    an optimal change to current situation that will lead to the best outcome. Like
    in answering predictive questions, our results will never be certain and have
    some uncertainty associated with them. However, the answers can help with data-informed
    decision making or can lead to studies that will verify the predicted results.

    plans to take. For example, “will we increase sales if we lower our prices?” includes
    a potential action that we will analyze: a reduction of prices. But a different
    question like “how can we decrease our carbon emissions?” does not include any
    actions and is asking for a list of candidate actions that will most likely decrease
    the carbon emissions. This means that an additional step must be taken in our
    strategy in order to develop a list of candidate actions.'
