    been proven by organizations,** enabling data-driven decisions on products, features,
    and processes. [Google was testing 40 shades of blue](https://bambrick.com.au/blog/google-increased-revenue-200-million-just-finding-perfect-shade-blue/)
    on a link in the search results, and the right blue shade led to 200M in revenue.
    [Booking.com has acknowledged](https://hbr.org/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation)
    the scaling and transformation of the organization were made possible by numerous
    testing and experiments conducted there.

- en: However, product experiments, like any other statistical testing or experimentation,
    **are prone to pitfalls**. These are design and/or execution flaws, which might
    be hidden or unsuspected throughout the process. It is the duty of the data team
    — Product Data Analysts/Data Scientists —to guardrail experimentations execution
    and analysis to get reliable results. And hence it is important to understand
    the common pitfalls and how to treat them, as they might mislead the analysis
    results and conclusion.

    poor and unreliable results, defeating the initial purpose of the experiment —
    which is for testing out the treatments and gauging the impact.
