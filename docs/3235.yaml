    are incredibly powerful and fundamental in the world of data analysis and statistics.
    Think about it this way: if you were to gather 50 shirts in various sizes and
    colors, you would have created a color distribution, a size distribution, and
    perhaps even a “how much does this shirt annoy you” distribution (jokingly, of
    course). The point is that as long as you have a category to measure, there’s
    a distribution waiting to be explored.'

    spreads across a scale of probabilities or likelihoods. You can figure this out
    either from the data you have or from what you know about a particular topic.
    You’ve probably heard of terms like the normal distribution, skewed distribution,
    long-tailed distribution, and so on — each of these describes how data points
    are shaped.

    in Bayesian Calibration. Bayesian Calibration is an approach that updates Bayesian
    inference with new data to find the best-fitting values for a model’s…
