    administrator outside the building where the challenge is taking place. She (the
    administrator) tells you to follow her as she will show you where the challenge
    occurs. You are both brought into an empty room with a large orange floor and
    four colored walls. There are no other challengers, tables, chairs, or anything
    else but two doors at each end of the room and the anticipation of what is about
    to happen.

  zh: 挑战的日子到了，你和你的朋友刚刚在挑战举行的建筑外与管理员见面。她（管理员）告诉你们跟着她，她会带你们去挑战发生的地方。你们被带入一个空房间，房间里有一个大橙色地板和四面彩色墙壁。房间里没有其他挑战者、桌子、椅子或其他东西，只有房间两端的两扇门和即将发生的事情的期待。
- en: 'The administrator starts telling you the rules: “The rules are quite simple:
    There are three rooms in total, the main room and two smaller rooms. The challenge
    is split into **six rounds**. Only one of you can be in the main room simultaneously
    while a round is going on, but you can switch who is in the room multiple times
    during each round. This rule means that you cannot see or hear each other. One
    person is placed in one of the smaller rooms with four canvases and drawing materials,
    and the other is placed in the other small room with four pieces of paper. There
    will be something on each of the four pieces of paper; The goal is to come as
    close to drawing what is on the papers as possible. You will know whether one
    is in the main room by a lamp above your door; it will turn green when no one
    is in the room and otherwise red. You may talk to each other between the rounds.”'

    cube on the floor in the main room. The administrator explains that while a round
    is going on, only the cube and one of you can simultaneously be in the main room.
    This means you can leave the cube in the main room while you rotate between those
    in there. You take the cube and notice that it is a bit sticky but think nothing
    more about it as the challenge is about to start and you are hyped and very confused!

- en: Soon after getting into your room, you see the light turn red, indicating that
    your friend just went into the main room, laughing a bit about the confusion he
    must have right now, just as you had yourself. Soon after, the lamp goes green
    again, indicating that your friend just left the room to try his luck guessing
    what was one the first of your papers. You pick up the second paper, an image

    be any different.

- en: And lord behold, you were right; nothing had changed! A bit irritated, you hit
    the cube with your shoe and see it roll a bit. You can at least play a bit of

    prospect of winning is slim, but you are surprised to see that your friend, for
    some reason, is in a higher spirit than you. You both bring the things from your
    room to see how close you are to each other’s paintings. And to no one’s surprise,
    nothing matched! Everything drawn was of random things that had nothing to do
    with your papers. You look at your friend in disbelief, not because the images
    don’t look like each other, but rather because of your friend’s positive energy,
    starkly contrasting your own.

  zh: 第一轮结束后，你和你的朋友再次见面，你感到有些沮丧，因为获胜的前景渺茫，但你惊讶地发现你的朋友出于某种原因比你更兴奋。你们都把房间里的东西带出来，看看彼此的画作有多接近。毫无意外的是，没有任何匹配的地方！所有的画作都是随机的，与你的纸张无关。你不敢相信地看着你的朋友，不是因为这些图像彼此不像，而是因为你朋友的积极能量与自己的消极情绪形成了鲜明的对比。
- en: You ask your friend why he is in such a good spirit. He tells you that he has
    figured out how to draw what is on your paper without talking together! You look
    puzzled at him and ask him to explain in more details. He tells you that he was
    quite confused the first time he entered the room as there was nothing to indicate
    what should be drawn; he went inside his room quite fast to get the rotations
    going. He expected the same the second time he went in, but to his surprise, the
    room did not look the same! “Not the same? You must be crazy,” you told your friend.
    “It is a big room with nothing in it; how can it look different? There are not
    even windows”.

  zh: 你问你的朋友为什么这么高兴。他告诉你，他已经弄清楚了如何在不交流的情况下绘制你纸上的内容！你困惑地看着他，要求他详细解释。他告诉你，第一次进入房间时他非常困惑，因为没有任何东西表明应该画什么；他很快回到自己的房间去调整旋转。第二次进入时，他也期望看到同样的情况，但令他惊讶的是，房间看起来并不一样！“不一样？你一定是疯了，”你告诉你的朋友。“这是一个空荡荡的大房间，怎么可能看起来不同？连窗户都没有。”
- en: As it turned out, the difference in the room was not significant; however, it
    was essential. Each time he came into the room, the cube on the floor was lying
    in different places. Knowing you, he knew you probably used it for football, but
    that was not important because this was the key to communicating!

  zh: 事实证明，房间的变化并不大；然而，它却至关重要。每次他进入房间时，地板上的立方体都在不同的位置。了解你的人知道你可能用它来踢足球，但这并不重要，因为这正是沟通的关键！
- en: “Yes, that is it!” you yell excitedly. You can use the floor to indicate what
    your friend should paint. In high spirits, both of you look at your papers again
    to see what he was supposed to paint. You agree to split the floor into four equal
    squares, one for when it is a cat, kitchen, burger, and tree. Easy!

    a Generative AI can generate anything we ask it to as long as it knows how (your
    friend may not be able to make music because he has yet to learn it). We often
    want AIs to be really good at small tasks rather than average at many things,
    so we usually confine it to just generating a single type of content, like images.
    But just like generalists and specialists have different roles at the workplace,
    specialized and general AIs can be used for different tasks and have each their
    strengths and weaknesses.

  zh: 生成式 AI 的目标是生成事物，就像你朋友的目标是“生成/制作”画作一样。但正如你朋友也可以写文本，生成式 AI 只要知道怎么做，就可以生成我们要求的任何东西（你的朋友可能还不能创作音乐，因为他还没学会）。我们通常希望
    AI 在小任务上表现得非常出色，而不是在许多事情上表现得平庸，因此我们通常将它限制在生成单一类型的内容上，比如图像。但正如通才和专家在工作场所有不同的角色一样，专门化和通用的
    AI 可以用于不同的任务，各有其优缺点。
- en: Generative AI can still generate a painting even when we do not tell it what
    to generate, as the friend did in the first round when you didn’t know how to
    communicate with each other. But it is often not practical to just generate random
    things, so you want a way to influence what is generated/painted. The problem
    is that you cannot directly tell the Generative AI what to generate, like you
    could not talk directly with your friend. Hence, you need to agree on another
    way to do it. The way you did it and the way that Generative AI does it is the
    same, you place a cube inside a room where different areas are reserved for different
    things. This is called a “Latent Space” for a Generative AI, which is just a fancy
    word for a special room where you and your friend cannot be simultaneously.

  zh: 即使我们没有告诉它生成什么，生成式 AI 仍然可以生成画作，就像朋友在第一次回合中你们不知道怎么沟通时一样。但仅仅生成随机的事物通常是不切实际的，所以你需要一种方法来影响生成的内容/画作。问题在于你不能像直接和朋友对话那样直接告诉生成式
    AI 生成什么。因此，你需要商定另一种方法来实现。你做的方式和生成式 AI 的方式是相同的，你把一个立方体放在一个房间里，这个房间中的不同区域保留给不同的事物。这被称为生成式
    AI 的“潜在空间”，这是一个特殊房间的 fancy 术语，你和你的朋友无法同时在其中。

  zh: 这时问题开始浮现。随着越来越多的事物被引入，记住事物的位置变得越来越困难。有两种方法可以解决这个问题：

    This will improve the ability to generate both a diverse set of things and new
    things.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先要做的是把看起来相似的东西放在一起。这将提高生成各种事物和新事物的能力。
- en: It will be easier to generate many things because you don’t need to remember
    where everything is placed, just what things in different areas look like, and
    even if you do not draw the right thing, you will not be too far away as it will
    look like what is in that area.
  id: totrans-106
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 生成许多事物会更容易，因为你不需要记住每样东西的放置位置，只需记住不同区域的事物样子，即使你没有画出正确的东西，也不会差得太远，因为它会看起来像那个区域里的东西。
- en: It will also be easier to generate new things as the focus is not on where things
    are but what they look like. This means that your friend will know that he should
    paint something with a bit of hair when you place the cube between something with
    no hair and long hair.
  id: totrans-107
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 生成新事物也会更容易，因为重点不在于事物的位置，而在于它们的样子。这意味着当你把立方体放在没有头发和长头发的事物之间时，你的朋友会知道他应该画一些带有一点头发的东西。

- en: The second thing to do is to use not just the floor but the walls as well. In
    the story, you and your friend talked about how it was possible to place everything
    on the floor but that it would not be a good solution as it would ruin your option
    of painting things that have yet to be seen. You cannot paint things that are
    yet to be seen because you now need, let’s say, a place for dogs with long and
    no hair. If you add these to your dog area, the effect will be that when the cube
    is placed between a dog and a wolf, you do not know when it is a combination between
    the two or just a dog with long hair.

  zh: 第二步是不仅使用地板，还要利用墙壁。在故事中，你和你的朋友讨论了如何将所有东西放在地板上，但这不是一个好解决方案，因为这会破坏你绘制尚未见过的东西的选项。你不能绘制尚未见过的东西，因为你现在需要，比如说，为长毛和无毛的狗找个地方。如果你把这些加到你的狗区域，那么当方块放置在一只狗和一只狼之间时，你无法知道它是两者的结合体还是仅仅是一只长毛的狗。

- en: This is why it is crucial to use not only the floor but the walls as well. It
    allows you to generate more things because you can express different concepts
    on each wall, like what animal it looks like on the floor and the hair length
    and size on the wall. The more walls you have, the more things can be generated/painted,
    but it will also be harder to “just paint a dog” as you have many more options
    now. So the number of walls you use will depend on how much control you want.

  zh: 这就是为什么不仅使用地板而且还要利用墙壁至关重要。它允许你生成更多的东西，因为你可以在每面墙上表达不同的概念，比如地板上看起来像什么动物以及墙上的毛发长度和大小。墙壁越多，能生成/绘制的东西就越多，但也会更难“仅仅画一只狗”，因为现在有更多的选项。因此，你使用的墙壁数量将取决于你想要多少控制。
- en: The last piece of paper had text rather than an image written on it. Generative
    AI does not care about what is on the paper, only where the cubes are placed in
    the room. Generative AIs, like OpenAI’s Dall-e 2, create a painting from the text
    you give it. The image at the beginning of the blog post was created by giving
    it the text “Two people standing in a bright wide white room with a door in the
    middle.”
