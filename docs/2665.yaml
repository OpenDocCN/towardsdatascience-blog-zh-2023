    administrator) tells you to follow her as she will show you where the challenge
    occurs. You are both brought into an empty room with a large orange floor and
    four colored walls. There are no other challengers, tables, chairs, or anything
    else but two doors at each end of the room and the anticipation of what is about
    to happen.

    There are three rooms in total, the main room and two smaller rooms. The challenge
    is split into **six rounds**. Only one of you can be in the main room simultaneously
    while a round is going on, but you can switch who is in the room multiple times
    during each round. This rule means that you cannot see or hear each other. One
    person is placed in one of the smaller rooms with four canvases and drawing materials,
    and the other is placed in the other small room with four pieces of paper. There
    will be something on each of the four pieces of paper; The goal is to come as
    close to drawing what is on the papers as possible. You will know whether one
    is in the main room by a lamp above your door; it will turn green when no one
    is in the room and otherwise red. You may talk to each other between the rounds.”'

    This means you can leave the cube in the main room while you rotate between those
    in there. You take the cube and notice that it is a bit sticky but think nothing
    more about it as the challenge is about to start and you are hyped and very confused!

    prospect of winning is slim, but you are surprised to see that your friend, for
    some reason, is in a higher spirit than you. You both bring the things from your
    room to see how close you are to each other’s paintings. And to no one’s surprise,
    nothing matched! Everything drawn was of random things that had nothing to do
    with your papers. You look at your friend in disbelief, not because the images
    don’t look like each other, but rather because of your friend’s positive energy,
    starkly contrasting your own.

    quite confused the first time he entered the room as there was nothing to indicate
    what should be drawn; he went inside his room quite fast to get the rotations
    going. He expected the same the second time he went in, but to his surprise, the
    room did not look the same! “Not the same? You must be crazy,” you told your friend.

    even windows”.

    was essential. Each time he came into the room, the cube on the floor was lying
    in different places. Knowing you, he knew you probably used it for football, but
    that was not important because this was the key to communicating!

    squares, one for when it is a cat, kitchen, burger, and tree. Easy!

    four rounds. The remaining papers are of three dogs, one of an American Hairless

    a lynx is more in the middle of the two… But at least your friend understood what

    is possible by placing the cube between two areas; this happened with the lynx.
    The problem with the new idea is that it gets harder to guess whether the cube
    is between two areas because it combines the two or just because one area has
    really long hair. You choose to drop the idea for now…

    having nothing in your hands. As you look closer at the cube, you realize that
    four lines go all the way around it, like it is put together by five small cubes
    to get the rectangular form. And now that you think about it, isn’t the cube more
    deformed than in the beginning? You call over your friend to inspect the cube
    more closely together. It turns out that what you thought was a single rectangular

    as we need to get the beans out first. The lowest part would be something like
    a stone that (hopefully) no one would eat. The tree defines how much like a tree
    the thing is, with a flower close to the left, a bush in the middle, and a tree
    to the right.

    winning)! You pick up the first paper, ready to nail this challenge. You see a
    cow on the first paper, easy. You go into the room to conquer the floor like you
    are 18 and back at the dance floor again. You place one cube in the middle of
    the floor to tell your friend it is found everywhere in the world and another
    cube around the middle to the left on the blue wall as it is a large animal with
    short hair. You take a look at the green wall, circles or stripes? Heck yeah,
    a bit of both, but primarily circles and not too many, placing that bad boy in
    the upper half a bit to the left. Dangerous? It is not totally harmless, but definitely
    not considered dangerous, and surely an animal: You place it in the lower right
    corner of the purple wall. Food? Many people eat cows, so you set the cube around
    the middle height as it is an animal but not a piece of meat. A cow looks nothing
    like a plant, so the cube is placed all the way to the left. Genius.'

    the last piece, ready to see the final challenge. As much confidence that filled
    your before, just as much disbelief is filling you now. There is not any image
    on the paper… There is not per se “nothing” on the paper… just… no image… What
    is on the paper, you may ask? Text… It says “Shiitake Mushroom.” You take some
    time to let the view sink in… You remember that no one told you that the drawing
    should look like the paper, just like what was on the paper. So… can you place
    the cubes just as before and get your friend to draw a shiitake mushroom? You
    think to yourself: “So even if I have text on the paper, my friend can still draw
    a mushroom? Let’s give it a try.” You try your luck and place the cubes like the
    paper displayed a shiitake mushroom. You put the cubes such that the one on the
    floor is near Japan. It is a small plant that can be eaten, so you place it at
    the top yellow wall around the middle. It is not an animal nor dangerous but is
    round and a have a stem, so you place it in the middle of the green wall and in
    the lower left corner of the purple wall. It is small and has no hair, so you
    place it to the left a bit up on the blue wall.'

- en: The goal of Generative AI is to generate things, just like your friend’s goal
    was “generating/making” paintings. But just like your friend can also write text,
    a Generative AI can generate anything we ask it to as long as it knows how (your
    friend may not be able to make music because he has yet to learn it). We often
    want AIs to be really good at small tasks rather than average at many things,
    so we usually confine it to just generating a single type of content, like images.
    But just like generalists and specialists have different roles at the workplace,
    specialized and general AIs can be used for different tasks and have each their
    strengths and weaknesses.

- en: Generative AI can still generate a painting even when we do not tell it what
    to generate, as the friend did in the first round when you didn’t know how to
    communicate with each other. But it is often not practical to just generate random
    things, so you want a way to influence what is generated/painted. The problem
    is that you cannot directly tell the Generative AI what to generate, like you
    could not talk directly with your friend. Hence, you need to agree on another
    way to do it. The way you did it and the way that Generative AI does it is the
    same, you place a cube inside a room where different areas are reserved for different
    things. This is called a “Latent Space” for a Generative AI, which is just a fancy
    word for a special room where you and your friend cannot be simultaneously.

    This will improve the ability to generate both a diverse set of things and new
    things.
  prefs: []

- en: It will be easier to generate many things because you don’t need to remember
    where everything is placed, just what things in different areas look like, and
    even if you do not draw the right thing, you will not be too far away as it will
    look like what is in that area.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It will also be easier to generate new things as the focus is not on where things
    are but what they look like. This means that your friend will know that he should
    paint something with a bit of hair when you place the cube between something with
    no hair and long hair.

- en: The second thing to do is to use not just the floor but the walls as well. In
    the story, you and your friend talked about how it was possible to place everything
    on the floor but that it would not be a good solution as it would ruin your option
    of painting things that have yet to be seen. You cannot paint things that are
    yet to be seen because you now need, let’s say, a place for dogs with long and
    no hair. If you add these to your dog area, the effect will be that when the cube
    is placed between a dog and a wolf, you do not know when it is a combination between
    the two or just a dog with long hair.

- en: This is why it is crucial to use not only the floor but the walls as well. It
    allows you to generate more things because you can express different concepts
    on each wall, like what animal it looks like on the floor and the hair length
    and size on the wall. The more walls you have, the more things can be generated/painted,
    but it will also be harder to “just paint a dog” as you have many more options
    now. So the number of walls you use will depend on how much control you want.

    AI does not care about what is on the paper, only where the cubes are placed in
    the room. Generative AIs, like OpenAI’s Dall-e 2, create a painting from the text
    you give it. The image at the beginning of the blog post was created by giving
    it the text “Two people standing in a bright wide white room with a door in the
    middle.”
