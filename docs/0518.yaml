- en: It is a common practice nowadays to construct deep neural networks with a set
    of convolution layers. However, it was not always like this, earlier neural networks
    and other machine learning frameworks didn’t employ convolutions. Feature extraction
    and learning were two separate fields of study until recently. This is why it
    is important to understand how Convolution works and why it took such an important
    place in deep learning architectures. In this article we shall explore the Convolution
    thoroughly and you would be able to understand the concept more deeply with an
    interactive tool.

- en: Convolution is the process of changing the shape of one function by applying
    another function. It is an operation on two functions just like any other arithmetic
    operation, however it is applied on functions and not on function values. Therefore,
    it produces a third function as a result. More formally, a Convolution ***C=f(x)*g(x)***
    is an operation between a function ***f*** and a function ***g*** and is represented
    by a convolution operator *****. In terms of mathematical formulation, Convolution
    is the integral of the product of the…
