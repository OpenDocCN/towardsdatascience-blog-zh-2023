    but after reviewing the applications, as well as sifting through the ones that
    LinkedIn filtered out due to their answers to the criteria questions, only two

    “data scientist” used to refer to a very senior person at a company who had a
    Master- or PhD-level education in the field. In contrast, now, anyone who completes

- en: '**Learning and growth beyond the classroom:** Learning data science in university
    or through a coding bootcamp is great and all, but these are very sterile environments
    that only take your skills to a certain level. While many employers know what
    they’re getting when they hire a fresh graduate, it can be beneficial to impress
    them with your ability to have gone beyond what you learned in the classroom.
    Working in data science is unique in that you will be constantly forced throughout
    your entire career to learn new technologies, apply new skills, and generally
    roll with the punches (i.e., learning how to work with ChatGPT and other advanced
    AI models instead of fearing them). Therefore, you might as well get in the groove
    of lifelong learning early on and impress the recruiters by showing them how you’ve
    advanced your knowledge already beyond the core fundamentals.'

  zh: '**课外学习和成长：** 在大学学习数据科学或参加编程训练营固然不错，但这些环境过于封闭，只能让你的技能达到一定水平。虽然许多雇主在招聘新毕业生时心知肚明，但展示你超越课堂所学的能力可能会给他们留下深刻印象。数据科学领域的工作独特之处在于，你的整个职业生涯都将被迫不断学习新技术，应用新技能，总是要随时应对挑战（例如，学会如何与ChatGPT和其他高级AI模型合作，而不是畏惧它们）。因此，你最好从早期就适应终身学习的节奏，并通过展示你如何已经将知识深化到核心基础之外来打动招聘者。'
- en: '**Ability to both lead and collaborate as part of a team:** There appears to
    currently be a glut of entry-level data scientists thanks to the popularity the
    field has received, especially in the last five or so years. That, coupled with
    a mass exodus of boomer data scientists who decided to retire in recent years,
    and you’re left with companies scrambling to fill positions at all levels, but
    especially those in more senior “team lead” or management positions. Not only
    that, but they’re also having to employ entry-level data scientists who may have
    never worked as part of a team due to completing their education in isolation
    during the height of the pandemic. Teamwork and leadership are two things that
    can’t really be taught (no matter how much they claim they can in those organizational
    behavior courses you''re forced to take), but you can improve your skills in them
    by practicing. It can be as simple as entering a hackathon and working as part
    of a team with people you’ve never met, or taking on a leadership role in a club
    or volunteer organization you’ve joined. Either way, you can demonstrate to employers
    that you can work as part of a team, and even lead a team if required.'

    conclusions that can help companies make vital decisions moving forward. This
    is why it can be useful when transitioning into a data science career from another
    career (i.e., as an engineer, teacher, nurse, scientist, etc.) to remain in the
    field and use the domain knowledge you’ve acquired to help companies looking to
    solve problems in the area. However, domain knowledge can also be acquired, whether
    by auditing university courses for free, reading books, or attending networking
    events. Whatever way you choose to acquire domain expertise, make sure you can
    speak to it under a variety of different scenarios and that you’ve created a portfolio
    where you’ve put your knowledge to the test in creating personal projects that
    solve problems in that field (see below).'

    don’t worry if you’re a new graduate — you may have developed experience in unexpected
    places, like a capstone project, an internship, or through a club you were a part

    you need to tailor the technologies, the skills, and the domain knowledge you
    acquire to fit a certain type of company. For example, if you’re going to a science-based
    company, you’ll likely need to be proficient in R; however, if you’re going to

    when you don’t have exact numbers. For these instances, develop some ranges for
    data to indicate the relative amount of work completed while acknowledging that
    it can vary sometimes. For example, I could say I completed on average 5 data

    Examples for each include stating how much money your project made for a company,
    how many people you managed within a team, how long you worked on a specific project,
    or how much you improved a certain ranking for or within a company. It can be

    the 500 other people who want the same thing, you need to include projects on
    your resume that impart impact. This will be industry-dependent, so it’s not a
    bad idea to do some preliminary research to see what problems are facing organizations
    and companies in that industry. It’s important to note that these problems don’t
    have to be huge, nor do they have to have never been solved before. You could
    even find an alternative solution to a problem that has already been solved. For
    example, you could run an analysis that finds that the undefinable anomalies in
    pollution data are coming from a road construction project that’s kicking up a
    lot of dust. Alternatively, you could run an analysis that tells a small business
    in your community that they should be marketing to their customers on Fridays
    because that incites the most weekend shoppers.

  zh: 如果你对在数据科学领域找到一份工作并从500名其他有相同愿望的人中脱颖而出感到认真，你需要在简历中包括能够带来影响的项目。这将取决于行业，因此做一些初步研究了解该行业面临的问题是个不错的主意。需要注意的是，这些问题不必是巨大的，也不必是前所未有的。你甚至可以找到一个已经解决了的问题的替代解决方案。例如，你可以进行分析，发现污染数据中无法定义的异常来自一个造成大量灰尘的道路建设项目。或者，你可以进行分析，告诉你社区中的一家小企业，他们应该在周五向顾客进行营销，因为这会引起最多的周末购物者。
- en: The main point of including impactful projects is to show recruiters that you
    can find a problem and work your way through to a solution. Project management
    through an entire project lifecycle is not something that comes easily, so showing
    you can successfully carry it out will mean a lot to recruiters, especially those
    who are looking for candidates to hit the ground running in an established data
    science department, or who are looking for candidates to be the data science department
    themselves. Further, these types of industry-specific projects are a great way
    to demonstrate domain knowledge and provide some impact, regardless of whether
    they get acted upon.
