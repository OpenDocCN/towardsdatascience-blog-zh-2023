    but after reviewing the applications, as well as sifting through the ones that
    LinkedIn filtered out due to their answers to the criteria questions, only two
    were viable candidates. Extrapolate this experience to those data science postings
    where 300 candidates have applied, and you can imagine how many of those are actual

    a data scientist. In many instances, the meaning of these job titles has changed
    over time. [For example](https://www.quora.com/Will-data-science-analysis-jobs-be-oversaturated),
    “data scientist” used to refer to a very senior person at a company who had a
    Master- or PhD-level education in the field. In contrast, now, anyone who completes
    a data science bootcamp may feel qualified to call themselves a data scientist
    because they understand statistics and can use some data analysis libraries.

    to get to the legitimate candidates, you need to step up your resume game to stand
    out from the rest. None of the suggestions listed below are groundbreaking or
    revolutionary, and if anything, you’ve probably heard of them before. However,
    once you start paying attention to these details, recruiters will begin paying
    more attention to you. Here are five things you can do to your resume to make
    a recruiter look at your resume twice.

    or through a coding bootcamp is great and all, but these are very sterile environments
    that only take your skills to a certain level. While many employers know what
    they’re getting when they hire a fresh graduate, it can be beneficial to impress
    them with your ability to have gone beyond what you learned in the classroom.
    Working in data science is unique in that you will be constantly forced throughout
    your entire career to learn new technologies, apply new skills, and generally
    roll with the punches (i.e., learning how to work with ChatGPT and other advanced
    AI models instead of fearing them). Therefore, you might as well get in the groove
    of lifelong learning early on and impress the recruiters by showing them how you’ve
    advanced your knowledge already beyond the core fundamentals.'

    currently be a glut of entry-level data scientists thanks to the popularity the
    field has received, especially in the last five or so years. That, coupled with
    a mass exodus of boomer data scientists who decided to retire in recent years,
    and you’re left with companies scrambling to fill positions at all levels, but
    especially those in more senior “team lead” or management positions. Not only
    that, but they’re also having to employ entry-level data scientists who may have
    never worked as part of a team due to completing their education in isolation
    during the height of the pandemic. Teamwork and leadership are two things that
    can’t really be taught (no matter how much they claim they can in those organizational
    behavior courses you''re forced to take), but you can improve your skills in them
    by practicing. It can be as simple as entering a hackathon and working as part
    of a team with people you’ve never met, or taking on a leadership role in a club
    or volunteer organization you’ve joined. Either way, you can demonstrate to employers
    that you can work as part of a team, and even lead a team if required.'

    conclusions that can help companies make vital decisions moving forward. This
    is why it can be useful when transitioning into a data science career from another
    career (i.e., as an engineer, teacher, nurse, scientist, etc.) to remain in the
    field and use the domain knowledge you’ve acquired to help companies looking to
    solve problems in the area. However, domain knowledge can also be acquired, whether
    by auditing university courses for free, reading books, or attending networking
    events. Whatever way you choose to acquire domain expertise, make sure you can
    speak to it under a variety of different scenarios and that you’ve created a portfolio
    where you’ve put your knowledge to the test in creating personal projects that
    solve problems in that field (see below).'

    Mistakes to Avoid*](/data-science-resume-mistakes-to-avoid-2867460659ac), your
    worth as a data scientist is tied to your ability to impact a company positively.
    In other words, recruiters want to know what problems you’ve solved and what the
    outcomes of the project were. Did a company optimize its process and increase
    its earnings after you found a way for it to market to its customers more efficiently?
    Did you discover a relationship between a nearby coal mine and its effect on wildlife
    that could initiate discussions on pollution management in your area? Whatever
    you’ve accomplished, recruiters want to know the details of how you’ve produced
    impact through the projects you’ve completed.'

    a data scientist, recruiters still want to know what your education and experience
    are in the field. A healthy mix of education and experience is sought after. But
    don’t worry if you’re a new graduate — you may have developed experience in unexpected
    places, like a capstone project, an internship, or through a club you were a part
    of. Additionally, you may have even made your own experience by developing a portfolio,
    starting a blog or newsletter, or doing pro bono work. Whatever your education

    conduct time-series analysis on penguin population numbers with the best of them,
    but if you can’t write code in Python, understand business problems in the business
    sphere, or give recommendations to clients based on well-rounded domain knowledge,
    you probably won’t be the right fit for certain companies. Recruiters are looking
    for individuals who have the “right stuff” — people with abilities in the right
    technologies and the right domain knowledge for that company. This means that
    you need to tailor the technologies, the skills, and the domain knowledge you
    acquire to fit a certain type of company. For example, if you’re going to a science-based
    company, you’ll likely need to be proficient in R; however, if you’re going to
    pretty much any other type of company, Python will be the standard. Luckily, nearly
    every industry out there needs data scientists, which means you get to pick a
    focus that you’re genuinely interested in!'

    you can tell an employer all day that you’ve got the skills for the job and that
    you’ve applied them to solve real-world problems. That’s great and all, but how
    are they supposed to believe you? I mean, they’ll find out either way if you make
    it to the technical interview, but you may never even get there if they interview
    another candidate who can show them definitively that they have the skills and
    the impact to back it up. A personal portfolio containing projects that solve
    problems in your target industry will help you convince recruiters that you have

    you know), but more so to do with the application software companies use to filter
    out resumes. With few, if any, companies even accepting resumes personally via
    email anymore, it’s becoming harder and harder to stand out when a piece of code
    is deciding whether or not to show your resume to the recruiter. As much as this
    seems like a stupid game to have to play, you’ll have to become an expert in including
    keywords in your resume to ensure that it even gets the remotest chance of being
    looked at by a human. The best way to do this is to [include keywords throughout
    your entire resume](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/resume-keywords-and-tips-for-using-them-2063331#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20an%20employer,your%20resume%20that%20seems%20appropriate.),
    such as in your education section, descriptions of past experience, and in the
    skills section. It’s also not a bad idea to include the most important keywords
    at the beginning of the resume, which will stand out most to a recruiter.

- en: The most eye-catching resumes that I’ve seen from experience are the ones that
    are not overwhelming with words. There are always plenty of whitespaces, large
    headers to break up sections, and bullet points containing only one to two sentences
    that provide thorough, but short summaries. When the recruiter doesn’t feel overwhelmed
    or drowned in words, it makes it a lot more pleasant to consider the resume.

  zh: 从经验来看，我见过的最引人注目的简历是那些没有用词过多的简历。这些简历总是有足够的留白，大标题用于分隔部分，以及仅包含一到两句话的要点，这些要点提供了详细但简短的总结。当招聘人员不会感到被大量文字压倒时，他们会更愉快地考虑这份简历。
- en: Given that recruiters are capable of looking over a resume and making a decision
    in [7.4 seconds](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=In%20its%202018%20Eye%2DTracking,an%20average%20of%207.4%20seconds.),
    a good benchmark for you to use is about 15 seconds — if you can’t get the big
    picture of your resume in that time, you need to make it more skimmable and make
    the important information easier to glean. Like with this article, I make all
    of the important points stand out, so you can skim this article in less than a
    minute, get the important information, and then read the body of the paragraphs
    if something is particularly relevant to you. You need to do the same with your
    resume.

  zh: 鉴于招聘人员能够在[7.4秒](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=In%20its%202018%20Eye%2DTracking,an%20average%20of%207.4%20seconds.)内浏览简历并做出决定，一个好的基准是大约15秒——如果你无法在这段时间内获得简历的总体印象，你需要使其更容易浏览，并使重要信息更易于获取。就像这篇文章一样，我使所有重要点突出显示，这样你可以在不到一分钟的时间内浏览这篇文章，获取重要信息，然后在某些内容对你特别相关时阅读段落的正文。你也需要在你的简历中做到这一点。
- en: Making your resume skimmable can be as easy as using big, bold headings to title
    your sections, dividing lines between sections, and bullet points to break up
    the text into readable, easy-to-digest segments. If you’re finding it difficult
    to include all of the relevant details, you can always pick the most insightful
    ones, and then fill in the remaining details in your portfolio or the interview.
    As much as everything should be said in the resume, much more can be said in a
    portfolio or interview, so the main focus should just be on imparting the details
    that will make or break a recruiter phoning you for an interview.
