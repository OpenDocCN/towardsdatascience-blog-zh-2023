- en: In the tumultuous year of 1945, as the world was gripped by what would be the
    final throes of World War II, a game of solitaire quietly sparked an advancement
    in the realm of computation. This was no ordinary game, mind you, but one that
    would lead to the birth of the Monte Carlo method([1](https://library.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00326866.pdf)).
    The player? None other than scientist Stanislaw Ulam, who was also deeply engrossed
    in the Manhattan Project([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924739/)).
    Ulam, while convalescing from an illness, found himself engrossed in solitaire.
    The complex probabilities of the game intrigued him, and he realized that simulating
    the game repeatedly could provide a good approximation of these probabilities([3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/monte-carlo-simulation)).
    It was a lightbulb moment, akin to Newton’s apple, but with playing cards instead
    of fruit. Ulam then discussed these ideas with his colleague John von Neumann,
    and together they formalized the Monte Carlo method, named after the famed Monte
    Carlo Casino in Monaco, (portrayed in Edvard Munch’s famous painting shown above),
    where the stakes are high and chance…
