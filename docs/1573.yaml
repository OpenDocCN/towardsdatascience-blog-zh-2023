    example of how seemingly simple rules can result in a fairly complex scenario

- en: '*While much has been written in data science about common distributions, such
    as the Normal distribution, real-life problems often require less common distributions
    and sometimes distributions without a name: rules of thumb and naive calculations
    of probabilities of events without deeply understanding the distribution. In this
    article, we’ll explore a problem where we’ll have to use the Negative Binomial
    distribution but actually will make some adjustments to fit our problem’s peculiarities.*'

- en: Many games and tournaments have complex rules. Why? They exploit our psychology
    to make the games more fun, addictive and often lucrative to the organizer by
    making our chances of winning appear higher than they are. It’s engaging when
    a fan, player or gambler believes they can win. This is most effective if you
    think your chances are better than they actually are.
