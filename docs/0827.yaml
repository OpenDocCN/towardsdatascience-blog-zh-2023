    that the distribution of T is rather complex, and cannot be ascribed to any of
    the well-known probability distributions. This is because even though, by assumption,
    each coupon has an equal probability of being present in a given box, the probability
    of finding a new coupon decays as we collect more and more coupons. Consider the
    scenario where we are required to collect 100 unique coupons. When we open the
    first box, we are guaranteed to find a new coupon since we don’t have any coupons

    of divide and conquer, a very popular strategy to solve probability problems.
    This involves breaking down a problem into smaller chunks of reduced complexity
    and approaching each chunk independently. Since T measures the time or the number
    of boxes that need to be opened to collect n unique coupons, we break it down

    the probability that we need to open more than c boxes to collect all n unique
    coupons.

    theory that has a wide range of practical applications. The problem involves collecting
    a set of N unique coupons, where each coupon is equally likely to be found in
    a given box. We have discussed various aspects of this problem, including the
    expected value and variance of the time it takes to collect all n unique coupons
    as well as the probability that more than a given number of boxes are needed to
    collect all n unique coupons.
