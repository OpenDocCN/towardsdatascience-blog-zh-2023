- en: If you haven’t come across this hiring format, a take-home project (or test/assignment)
    is a way of assessing a candidate’s fit through a project that mimics what the
    candidate would encounter on the job. It’s a popular strategy for hiring across
    many technical and non-technical positions.

- en: When it comes to the analytics industry, a take-home assignment often involves
    giving candidates a dataset with a list of closed- and/or open-ended questions
    they must answer using the data. This is usually accompanied by the candidate
    presenting their findings through a presentation and submitting any scripts/code/documentation.

    candidate’s skills and abilities than an in-person interview alone or even a skills
    test. In my hiring experience, the take-home project—particularly the presentation
    — really helped separate candidates that could pick up nuances in our business-specific
    data vs those that perhaps had solid fundamentals but had a hard time separating
    noise from signal. This truly helped us hire well-rounded talent that could move
    the needle.

    together. Including more than one table in your assignment will help the candidate
    demonstrate their ability to understand how to work with varying granularities
    and objects to tell a common narrative.

    to your specific hiring needs. You may need to adjust how you allocate points
    depending on whether you’re looking for talent that leans towards a technical
    or business-centric direction, but, in my experience, fostering a culture where
    analysts develop a balanced skillset leads to more fulfilling careers and better
    outcomes.

- en: One common question is how long to give candidates to complete the assignment?
    It’s important to consider that people can be busy and to provide flexibility
    depending on the candidate’s personal situation. However, it is important for
    the candidate to be able to demonstrate the ability to set a date and commit to
    it. Generally speaking, I would expect that one week should be a reasonable time
    to return the assignment.
