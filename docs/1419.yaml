    financial institutions throughout the Americas, I have had the good fortune to
    witness how data modeling can help standardize an organization’s way of defining
    and describing its data. I’ve seen firsthand how a sound data model accelerated
    the implementation of a data catalog and the launch of data quality programs,
    and how a lack of one caused similar programs to self-destruct.

    the purchase was made in — each of which constitute their own concept. Moreover,

    metamodel that is used consistently across the organization. To confirm — you
    need one, and only one. Without a metamodel in place (let’s say, the basic grammar
    and vocabulary of a universal language), all sorts of data models (dialects or
    even entirely different languages) may sprout up, causing interpretability and
    interoperability problems across domains, processes, and systems.

    with me, but many perfectly fit-for-purpose metamodels live in tools like Microsoft
    Excel, PowerPoint, or Visio, and depending on the size and complexity of your
    organization, that can be appropriate *as long as* it is strictly adhered to by
