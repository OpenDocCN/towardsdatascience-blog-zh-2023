- en: Protein design and engineering are essential goals in molecular biology, with
    wide-ranging applications in various fields including medicine, biotechnology,
    and materials science. Scientists have been exploring already for some decades
    various approaches to designing novel proteins and engineering existing ones to
    fine-tune their properties. While physics-based approaches have had some success
    in finding amino acid sequences that fold to a given protein structure, the recent
    developments in deep learning methods have shown much higher success rates and
    versatility. In this article, I will outline four notable machine learning (ML)
    tools for protein design and engineering and their significance in advancing the
    field.

    biological sciences, the methods they introduce and even the projects themselves
    offer exciting opportunities for data scientists, machine learning practitioners,
    and AI researchers to think new ideas and ways to collaborate with chemistry and
    biology scientists who can end up applying computer science for good…
