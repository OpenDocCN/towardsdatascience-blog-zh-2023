    and [cosmetics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005738), in many cases the
    reported performance scores are unreliable. Beyond contributing to the [reproducibility
    crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) in machine learning
    and artificial intelligence, the effect of unrealistically high performance scores
    is usually further amplified by the [publication bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias),

    exists in the evaluation of various segmentation techniques: authors have the
    freedom to account for pixels outside the circular field of view area, and this
    choice is rarely indicated in publications. This ambiguity can result in the ranking
    of algorithms based on incomparable performance scores. The functionalities implemented

    the experimental setups, the package contains the statistics of the dataset and
    provides two high-level functions to test the ambiguity of image-level and aggregated
    scores. For example, having a triplet of image level accuracy, sensitivity and
