    and CEOs.
  prefs: []

    different business areas—from general business controlling, marketing to supply
    chain management and finance.

    much attention from every colleague in the company.

    The answer was simple—make them sound cool.

    was not an option.

    that I named mine after the trending buzzwords this year.

    report was named **“The Vax 2021”**, and the 2022 report was **“The ChatGPT 2022”.**
