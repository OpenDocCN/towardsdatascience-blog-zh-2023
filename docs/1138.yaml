- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily
    lives. From recommendation systems in almost every webshop, to automatic translation
    of foreign languages on websites you visit. For some industries this transition
    seems to be going more smoothly than for others though. The medical field seems
    to be especially challenging to enter, but why? There is so much academic activity
    dedicated to AI in the medical space, so what’s keeping these technological breakthroughs
    from having tangible impact in healthcare? Sendak et al. tried to find an answer
    to that question in their review paper [“A path for translation of Machine Learning
    Products into healthcare delivery”](https://emj.emg-health.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/A-Path-for-Translation-of-Machine-Learning.....pdf)
    (2020). Their findings really resonated with what I know from experience at [UbiOps](https://ubiops.com/)
    in [working with MedTech startups](https://ubiops.com/medical-breakthrough-from-ellogon-ai-runs-on-ubiops-platform/),
    so in this article I will walk you through their paper.

    state of machine learning in the medical field. Enthusiasm and excitement about
    the possibilities of machine learning in the medical field have been immense,
    leading to an astonishing amount of literature on the topic. Every other week
    you can read about a new study that has been done on using ML for cancer detection,
    and using ML for drug discovery also appears to be a hot topic. A multitude of
    conferences, organizations and academic journals have been set up to disseminate
    knowledge surrounding the very topic of ML in healthcare.

    impact remains scant. You might think “Oh but it always takes a while before new
    technologies become mature enough to be applied in practice”, but at the same
    time we can see that new findings on using ML for better user retention are quickly
    adopted by the likes of TikTok, Instagram and LinkedIn. Panch et al eloquently

    their own first hand experiences in building machine learning products with 21
    case studies of machine learning models that successfully made their way into
    clinical care. And this is exactly what I find so interesting about their research,
    the fact that they tried to learn from those that *actually* made the step into
    production.

    and productionisation knowledge. You can only have so many people in your team,
    and at the same time you need to ensure that enough medical experts are involved,
    but also the right people who can actually build and deploy your solution. Where
    to put the focus is highly dependable, but Sendak et al do a great job of highlighting
    the importance of having both these capabilities in your team in some way if you
    want to be successful.

- en: Of course not every skill set needs to be represented by an actual person on
    the team! Certain things can also be outsourced, or tools can be brought in that
    take care of the standard tasks so experts can focus on what’s unique to your
    solution. I see so many companies getting swept up in building their own platforms
    with a bunch of open source tooling because that’s free. But let’s not forget
    the costs associated with having all the people on your team that have to invest
    time and energy into setting up all of that tech! While they are busy trying to
    get a deployment tool working, you are losing time that you could have spent on
    actually improving your model and driving value…

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s often unclear what differentiates a good model from a bad one, and what
    performance you should be striving for in your specific case. If left undiscussed,
    this can lead to a mismatch in expectations and reality. Important to note here
    is that this doesn’t only concern model accuracy, but also usability and potential
    economic performance. A model that has amazing accuracy, but takes 10 hours to
    run, will probably not be very useful, nor affordable. Every case is different,
    and it’s key that a conversation is had early on to identify and agree on the
    relevant model performance metrics.

    test datasets, does not mean that the product will perform well in a real-life
    setting. It’s important to get real life data fed through the product, and to
    use it to assess its performance. At UbiOps we focus on deployment and serving
    and we have seen many times that performance can change tremendously after the
    model is introduced to actual production data! It’s important to get to that stage
    early, even if it’s just as a shadow deployment.

    example cases they investigated they found that often significant effort and investment
    were needed to integrate products into the existing systems. [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837212/)
    estimated the cost to validate and integrate the Kidney Failure Risk Equation
    into clinical workflows at a single site at nearly $220,000\. That’s only a single

    spread out across various cloud solutions and on premise data centers. This typically
    starts causing issues in the scaling out phase. Being aware of this while you
    design your product and architecture can greatly benefit the transition from proof
    of concept to properly rolled out product.

    to mention the fact that the rules are continuously changing. It’s difficult to
    stay on top of everything and make sure that every part of your product is fully
    compliant. Data security is especially an obstacle, as the data is so sensitive.

    to that diffuse and scale step. **It’s absolutely crucial to get out of that development
    environment and run things in production**, albeit in a shadow mode. Only after
    making that step can you start moving towards a product that actually has impact
    and value.
  prefs: []

    **make sure that you invest in an infrastructure that helps you in iterating quickly**
    and that allows you to focus on what you’re good at: building models for medical
    use cases. Investing in MLOps tools that can help you deploy quickly, and monitor
    what’s going on, can really help in making sure that you can focus on the actual
    challenges at hand, rather than standard infrastructure challenges. I see so many
    companies getting swept up in building their own platforms with a bunch of open
    source tooling because that’s free. But let’s not forget the costs associated
    with having all the people on your team investing time and energy into setting

    you are using already has the right certifications (like ISO certifications).
    Specifically in Europe it can also make sense to work with more niche cloud providers
    rather than the big three. Working with a cloud provider specialized in medical
    data you will have a lot less headache in proving that you are compliant with
    all the rules.

    phases of this translational path and the different obstacles that might come
    your way will definitely help in setting you up for success.
