    might expect, Covid-19 was a special kind of brutal for a business that relied
    on good faith human-to-human interaction. When the world is forming insular [social
    pods](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/pandemic-pod-winter-covid/2020/10/14/214ed65c-0d63-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html),
    it’s going to be hard to get anyone to stay at a stranger’s house. And so, as
    you might expect, our metrics tanked — our core metrics dropped to *single digit*
    YoY values. No one was booking Airbnbs anymore, and *sure as hell* no one was
    looking to host new Airbnbs.

    an admirably swift response. While we were all setting up home offices and hoarding
    toilet paper and canned goods from Costco, Brian held an emergency all-hands.
    He told us definitively: “travel as we know it is over.” He had no clear answer
    to what we should do next, but still there was a lighthouse-like directive through
    the storm: stop everything you’re working on that isn’t critical and figure out
    how to survive the pandemic.'

    which is a wild thing to be a part of at a company of that scale. We launched
    Airbnb online experiences in record time. With a new mantra of “near is the new
    far”, we curated and pushed people towards locales that were great bunker locations
    for the pandemic. New initiatives that clearly didn’t fit into the future were
    shut down (I was part of a team called “social stays”, and in spite of the heavy
    sunk cost, we killed the endeavor quickly). We took on new financing, restructured
    the company. The company made hundreds — perhaps even thousands of decisions —
    a day, and, as a result, managed to swim through the worst of the pandemic with
    as much finesse as you could possibly hope for.

    spend this post talking about the role of data during this period and what learnings
    we can glean from that experience. My most shocking realization: data, which had
    until then been a key driver in almost every strategic conversation, became secondary
    overnight. At that time, to fight for “data-driven decision-making” would have
    been laughable — not because data wasn’t *useful* during this transitionary period,
    but because data shouldn’t drive in a crisis. In what follows, I’ll discuss root
    cause of this mindset shift: urgency. Let’s consider different decision-making
    circumstances, then discuss how we should be leveraging data therein. It’s time
    to finally talk about what “data-driven” should actually mean.'

    urgent, we can proceed with analytics as we ideally would — iterating closely
    with our stakeholders to better navigate the space of possible actions. Imagine,
    for instance, your company’s executives wants to overhaul your landing page, but
    they want your support on deciding what to put there. The ML SWE on your team
    jumps to a card sort solution, but you and your stakeholders know the more critical
    decision to make is whether or not you want to apply that sort of solution in
    the first place.

    the decision space: you can sift through past experiments and collate learnings
    that might inform the decision at hand; you can run small opportunity size checks
    to see what the bounds of any change might be; you can provide demographic/channel/other

    carefully analyzing segments, sifting through past experiments, etc. But every

    are somewhat proximate to major cities, then you’ll maximize bookings because
    guests will (a) feel sufficiently secluded from Covid but also (b) close enough
    to be able to return home to their friends and families in case of emergency.
    You get back to the executives within a few hours, they launch an initiative to

    case — you’re still helping your stakeholders navigate the idea maze, but the
    decisions being made are largely intuition-driven, so your involvement is necessarily
    more shallow. This is not to say you should comply blindly, reinforcing a [precedent
    of reactivity](https://win.hyperquery.ai/p/the-bad-loop-ruining-analytics) — still
    understand why, but accept that your involvement will be less structured, less
    rigorous. And as much as you could get stakeholders to a *better* decision given
    enough time, you don’t have enough time, and a 80% correct decision *now* is infinitely
    more valuable than a 90% correct decision tomorrow.

    on a user support page, the experiment doesn’t converge, but your stakeholder
    wants to know the truth of the result. This is where you push back — analytics
    can certainly provide an answer here, but what actions will change as a result?
    Will you learn anything? Stakeholders already *know* this is a better experience,
    they ask to be certain, but you know certainty at this level of experimental exposure
    is impossible.

    or at minimum, we don’t learn something from exploring our data, we probably shouldn’t
    be doing the work in the first place. Learn to predict what the impact of your
    work might be — [what’s the potential lift if you help make this decision?](https://georgexing.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-data-driven)

    **importance** ought to be considered when choosing the right analysis for a task.
    When a decision is urgent, data should almost always take a backseat to intuition.
    When the decision is extremely important, data should be used more diligently
    to validate assumptions and keep intuition in check. When the decision isn’t important,
    you shouldn’t be spending a lot of time worrying about the decision anyway, and
    so any analytics work should be reconsidered before done.
