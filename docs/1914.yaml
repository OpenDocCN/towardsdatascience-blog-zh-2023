    One of the main methods we have at our disposal for managing these costs is performance
    optimization. Performance optimization is an iterative process in which we consistently
    search for opportunities to increase the performance of our application and then
    take advantage of those opportunities. In previous posts (e.g., [here](/overcoming-data-preprocessing-bottlenecks-with-tensorflow-data-service-nvidia-dali-and-other-d6321917f851))
    we have stressed the importance of having appropriate tools for conducting this
    analysis. The tools of choice will likely depend on a number of factors including
    the type of training accelerator (e.g., GPU, HPU, or other) and the training framework.

    bottleneck in the data loader](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_profiler_tutorial.html#improve-performance-with-the-help-of-profiler).
    Performance bottlenecks in the input data pipeline are not uncommon and we have
    discussed them at length in some of our previous posts (e.g., [here](/overcoming-data-preprocessing-bottlenecks-with-tensorflow-data-service-nvidia-dali-and-other-d6321917f851)).

    Thus, the average overall step time is 80 milliseconds and not 240 milliseconds
    as reported. This can be seen clearly in the Trace tab (which, in our experience,
    almost always provides a more accurate report) where each step takes ~80 milliseconds.

    in the training environment including the GPU type and the PyTorch version. We
    also note that while the tutorial baseline results clearly diagnose the performance
    issue as a bottleneck in the DataLoader, our results do not. We have often found
    that data loading bottlenecks will disguise themselves as a high percentage of
    “CPU Exec” or “Other” in the Overview tab.

    streamlining the data input flow, [memory pinning](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#use-pinned-memory-buffers).
    Using pinned memory can increase the speed of host to GPU data copy and, more
    importantly, allows us to make them asynchronous. This means that we can prepare
    the next training batch **in the GPU** in parallel to running the training step
    on the current batch. It is important to note that although [asynchronous execution](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#asynchronous-execution)
    will generally increase performance, it can also **reduce the accuracy of time
    measurements**. For the purposes of our blog post we will continue to use the
    measurements reported by PyTorch Profiler. See [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#asynchronous-execution)
    for instructions on how to attain precise measurements. For additional details

    meaningful effect on its convergence. As in the case of increasing the batch size
    (see above) the impact of using mixed precision will vary per model. In some cases,
    AMP will work with little to no effort. Other times you might need to work a bit
    harder to tune the autoscaler. Still other times you might need to set the precision
    types of different portions of the model explicitly (i.e., *manual* mixed precision).'

    PyTorch eager-execution mode in which each PyTorch operation is run “eagerly”,
    the [compile](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.compile.html) API
    converts your model into an intermediate computation graph which it then compiles
    into low-level compute kernels in a manner that is optimal for the underlying
    training accelerator. For more on model compilation in PyTorch 2, check out our
    [previous post](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/tips-and-tricks-for-upgrading-to-pytorch-2-3127db1d1f3d)

- en: '**Is our work complete? Absolutely not!** Each optimization that we implement
    uncovers new potential opportunities for performance improvement. These opportunities
    are presented in the form of resources being freed up (e.g., the way in which
    moving to mixed precision enabled our increasing the batch size) or in the form
    of newly uncovered performance bottlenecks (e.g., the way in which our final optimization
    uncovered a bottleneck in host-to-device data transfer). Furthermore, there are
    many other well-known forms of optimization that we did not attempt in this post
    (e.g., see [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html)
    and [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html)). And lastly, new
    library optimizations (e.g., the model compilation feature that we demonstrated
    in step 7), are released all the time, further enabling our performance improvement
    objectives. As we emphasized in the introduction, to fully leverage such opportunities,
    performance optimization must be an iterative and consistent part of your development
    workflow.'

    on a toy classification model. Although there are other performance analyzers
    that you can use, each with their pros and cons, we chose PyTorch Profiler and
    the TensorBoard plugin due to their ease of integration.

- en: We should emphasize that the path to successful optimization will vary greatly
    based on the details of the training project, including the model architecture
    and training environment. In practice, reaching your goals may be more difficult
    than in the example we presented here. Some of the techniques we described may
    have little impact on your performance or might even make it worse. We also note
    that the precise optimizations that we chose, and the order in which we chose
    to apply them, was somewhat arbitrary. You are highly encouraged to develop your
    own tools and techniques for reaching your optimization goals based on the specific
    details of your project.

    we will dive into a performance issue that is quite common in PyTorch models in
    which portions of the computation is run on the CPU rather than the GPU, often
    in a manner that is unbeknownst to the developer. We also encourage you to check
