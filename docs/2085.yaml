    team.

    using different data sources. In many cases, the products have client-side (for
    example, Google Analytics or Amplitude) and back-end data (for example, application
    logs, access logs or logs of API gateway). So we can use different data sources
    to verify KPI dynamics. If you see an anomaly only in one data source, your problem
    is likely data-related and doesn’t affect customers.

    manager came to me saying activation was broken because conversion from registration
    to the first successful action (i.e. purchase in case of e-commerce) had been
    decreasing for three weeks. However, it was an everyday situation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The root cause of the decrease was the time window. We track activation within
    the first 30 days after registration. So cohorts registered 4+ weeks ago had the
    whole month to make the first action. But customers from the last cohort had only
    one week to convert, so conversion for them is expected to be much lower. If you
    want to compare conversions for these cohorts, change the time window to one week
    or wait.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In case of data delays, you may have a similar decreasing trend in recent days.
    For example, our mobile analytical system used to send events in batches when
    the device was using a Wi-Fi network. So on average, it took 3–4 days to get all
    events from all devices. So seeing fewer active devices for the last 3–4 days
    was usual.
  prefs: []

    It will prevent your team from making wrong decisions based on data. However,
    people may still accidentally bump into such inaccurate metrics, and you should
    spend some time understanding how methodologically accurate metrics are before
    diving deep into root cause analysis.

    save you and your colleagues hours of work. It’s worth putting together a list
    of hypotheses and tools to check them (links to dashboards, external sources of
    information on your competitors etc.). Please, keep in mind that writing down
    the checklist is not a one-time activity: you should add new knowledge to it once
    you face new types of anomalies so it stays up-to-date.'

    your product, for example, changes in price, launches of competitive products
    or new feature releases. The changelog will allow you to find all significant
    events in one place not looking through multiple chats and wiki pages. It can
    be demanding not to forget to update the changelog. You could make it part of
    analytical on-call duties to establish clear ownership.

    we should have **a monitoring system in place** to learn about anomalies as soon
    as possible and start looking for root causes. So save some time establishing
    and improving your alerting and monitoring.
