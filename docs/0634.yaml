    to hear a variety of thoughts and perspectives from smart, diverse, and talented
    people. We cover topics ranging from the [technical](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-achieved-metric-consistency-at-scale-f23cc53dea70)
    to the [procedural](https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails), and we regularly
    tie these back to our work streams. Online discussion groups, local meetups, and
    conferences are terrific, but I feel there’s even more value in getting the people
    in your organization together to discuss industry trends, as it can provide direction
    for your teams and their projects.

    how we can measure it. In an [earlier article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/data-teams-as-support-teams-2bb1f1ed31b),
    I talked about how data teams generate value, but this isn’t the only way. Regardless
    of whether you’re providing business support, enabling automation through reverse
    ETL, or feeding data to advanced analytical and machine learning use-cases, there’s
    always a lingering question: did we save or generate more than we spent?'

    on vibes.” This shouldn’t be taken as a slight, but rather a concession to the
    difficulty in creating firm metrics around impact and value. Additionally, embedded
    in this idea is that there is subjective and perhaps non-quantifiable value in
    analytical outputs, which we’ll discuss in a moment.

    and more about what the table stakes are. During our discussion, I brought up
    the idea that we don’t necessarily know why data-driven companies succeed, but
    [research indicates that they do](https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2022_0101_Dashboarding_WeillWoerner).
    One person responded with this insight: maybe the dashboards aren’t “doing anything,”
    at least not in the sense of driving a specific, deliberate action. What if instead
    of (or in addition to) actionable insights, their value is in motivating and aligning
    our customers?'

- en: At one point in my career, I was working as a BI developer for a wholesale company,
    and we had reporting that provided our sales team with summaries of their sales
    metrics. This report saw reasonable usage throughout the month, but it sky-rocketed
    at month-end, with some users refreshing several times an hour. I remember being
    completely bewildered by this trend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m sure there were several operational use cases behind this behavior, but
    in hindsight, I believe one of the most valuable outputs of the report was motivation.
    Seeing their shipments go out in near real-time made our salespeople excited;
    it gave them the extra “oomph” to make calls and close deals as they rushed to
    meet or exceed quota. This reporting was doing very real work and driving a business
    process, even if it wasn’t in the way that we would typically expect.

    these data artifacts. A dashboard is a shared object and can serve as a common
    thread of conversation between colleagues. Even if the underlying data isn’t remarkable
    or particularly insightful, the dialogues and shared narratives sparked by them
    can be valuable. Alignment is a powerful tool for an organization, and data can
    drive alignment.

- en: As “objective” people, many data professionals may be reluctant to accept that
    “inspiration” is a valid or valuable output; however, we’re missing something
    if we don’t use data to motivate us. I resisted this idea initially, but reflecting
    on my career, I have many stories and anecdotes like the above, and I can’t help
    but feel that this qualitative impact is significant. Perhaps the most important
    lesson I took away from this experience is that just because I couldn’t perceive
    a mechanism for generating value doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist.

    opinion is a trope at this point, but there’s something powerful that happens
    when data affirms our beliefs and reassures us that we’re on the right track.
    That data often supports the status quo rather than upends it should be celebrated,
    not feared.

    like our data products. This could range from providing ergonomic naming conventions
    and easily-consumable tables for analysts and data scientists to delivering aesthetically-pleasing
    dashboards for business users.

    data products? Should we have surveys? I would caution that we don’t want to be
    too heavy-handed; as with all internal products, we’re at risk of having a tenuous
    relationship with the actual value chain (i. e., how we get paid).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, I think there’s room for providing lightweight systems to drive feedback
    in the data product lifecycle. Which features are loved? Which are hated? When
    is it safe for a data product to go into “maintenance mode,” and when do we sunset?
    In my experience, these questions are almost always raised in an ad-hoc fashion,
    and by that point in the product’s lifecycle, even identifying active users can
    be complicated by process automation that has been long since forgotten.

    one of the data engineering managers on my team, brought up this cogent point:
    why is quality an afterthought when it’s a critical component to satisfy our customers’
    demands?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To some extent, this is a matter of resources. Data teams are frequently scrappy
    and asked to take on far more work than they’re capable of delivering. They’re
    mired in operational woes and unclear requirements. When pressed for time, delivering
    an incomplete thing is better than delivering nothing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But like standardized tests where you’re penalized for wrong answers, poor data
    quality damages trust. If your team consistently cranks out dashboards that are
    inaccurate, stale, and inconsistent, your customers will lose trust in you. And
    the damage isn’t limited to you and your team; you’re contributing to a culture
    of mistrust that can require years of work and huge turnover to repair.

    feature of our products, and we need to involve them in the tradeoffs. Since data
    quality has many [dimensions](/the-six-dimensions-of-data-quality-and-how-to-deal-with-them-bdcf9a3dba71),
    our customers have to be involved in prioritizing: how should we handle unusual
    data volumes? What should we do when we encounter a schema change? Is it more
    important to deliver incomplete data on time or complete data late? While there’s
    a sense of what “poor” data quality is, managing the tradeoffs in delivering “good”
    data is much more complicated and context-sensitive.'

    data teams to adequately judge whether or not their work is having an impact.
    Yes, dollar or FTE-equivalent attribution is the gold standard, but in cases where
    that’s not available, knowing that we’re delivering high-quality data to engaged,
    satisfied users is a good proxy. These metrics also allow us to capture those
    unintended benefits of a data product; perhaps our users are applying the outputs
    to different processes altogether.
  prefs: []

- en: One salient point that Niral raised in a follow-up conversation is that data
    products should be actionable; an automation or dashboard should drive some action
    that generates value. It’s critical to make the distinction between creating data
    products with the primary goal of psychosocial impact and considering psychosocial
    impact as a dimension of value. I wouldn’t suggest that, in the planning phase,
    we make a product with the sole goal of improving morale or team cohesion, as
    that value proposition is tenuous at best. Rather, if our product fails to drive
    its intended action but is still wildly popular, we should have the framework
    in place to investigate why. Essentially, we don’t want to throw away something
    valuable just because it’s not “working as intended.”

    to the workplace well-being of our stakeholders; if providing a data pull or a
    dashboard makes users happy, there’s utility in that. It certainly can’t be the
    data team’s only value proposition, but it’s also not something we should discount.
    While it may be tempting to lean into objectivity and dismiss the human elements
    of our work (“weaknesses” that data can “overcome”), the reality is that we’re
    social creatures working in complex organizations. We have tools for cutting through
    subjectivity, but most of our work will pass through another person’s hands; there’s
    more value in acknowledging and recognizing that human element than there is in
    turning away from it.'
