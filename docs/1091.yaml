    It is also enriched with a great number of keywords and features that allow you
    to interact with your data in all kinds of ways. With this flexibility comes a
    lot of variance in query writing styles and choices.

- en: Once you issue a query to your database, it has to parse your query to understand
    its flow, but that’s not where the work of the database ends. The database engine
    also has a component to look at your query and, in a sense, rewrite it without
    changing what it does at all to allow for better performance and response times.
    This mighty component, unsurprisingly, is called the **query optimizer**.

    does it have to act on the query? These are the questions that when answered,
    classify different types of query optimizers. Broadly speaking, there are **four
    kinds of query optimization techniques**, as mentioned below:'
