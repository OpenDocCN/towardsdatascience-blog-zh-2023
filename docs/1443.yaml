- en: Statistics is a mysterious field. Within its vast corpus of theories, formulations,
    and frameworks, lies knowledge that has profound applications across all areas
    of study. However, despite its tremendous success, it can be unfriendly too because
    a lot of its power comes from the assumptions it makes. Some of the most common
    assumptions include the i.i.d. assumption (independent and identically distributed)
    and the normality assumption (that the data in question can be approximated/converges
    to a normal distribution). As soon as these assumptions start to break, the theories
    start to become more and more complex, and even if they do work, they tend to
    lose a lot of their power. Fortunately, there are theorems and laws that support
    these assumptions, such as the Central Limit Theorem, which demonstrates that
    the normality assumption holds true for estimators from various distributions
    for large sample sizes. However, in order to fully realize the potential of statistics
    and harness its power, it’s essential to verify that the data meet these assumptions
    before using statistical frameworks or tests to draw conclusions. By carefully
    assessing whether the data meets the necessary assumptions and adjusting our methods
    accordingly, we can ensure that statistical analyses provide accurate and reliable
    insights that can help us make informed decisions across a wide range of disciplines.

    your data is normally distributed: QQ Plots. As the name suggests, it’s a graphical
    method that requires a visual inspection to conclude if your data is distributed
    normally or not. There are not a lot of visual methods in statistics as most hypothesis-testing
    frameworks rely on estimators, critical regions, and p-values to obtain numeric
    estimates. There are such frameworks (eg. Kolmogorov Smirnov Test) for testing
    normality as well. But these frameworks have been found to be much weaker compared
    to the much simpler method of using QQ Plots. It is also important to acknowledge
    that QQ plots can be used to test that your data follows any distribution, not
    necessarily a normal one. For example, if you believe that income is exponentially
    distributed, you can still use a QQ plot to check for it. It’s just that the test
    is mostly used in the context of normal distributions, because of their immense
    utility in Statistics.'

    of the given data against the theoretical (or expected) quantiles. Since we’ll
    be using these plots to check if the data is normally distributed, the theoretical
    quantiles must correspond to the quantiles of the normal distribution. But, what
    are these quantiles?
  prefs: []

    the median is the 50th percentile (or quantile), which divides the distribution
    into two equal parts.

    the distribution of the data is not similar to that of the exponential distribution.
    In fact, we can draw a QQ plot of the sample against the Uniform distribution
    as follows to show that the sample indeed fits a standard uniform distribution:'

    analysis. By comparing the distribution of our data to a theoretical distribution,
    QQ plots enable us to gain deeper insights into the behavior of our data and identify
    any departures from the expected distribution. Furthermore, the versatility of
    QQ plots allows us to apply them in various scenarios, such as identifying outliers,
    comparing datasets, and model diagnostics. These applications demonstrate the
    broad utility of QQ plots and underscore their importance in the realm of statistical
    analysis. QQ plots provide a powerful and easy-to-understand approach for exploring
    the distribution of data, and their significance in statistical literature is
    a testament to their value. By leveraging QQ plots in our analyses, we can unlock
    new insights into our data and make informed decisions based on a deeper understanding
    of its behavior.
