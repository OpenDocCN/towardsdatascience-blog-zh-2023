    meeting, she asked her management team to provide input on their recent accomplishments.
    However, all she heard back were technical achievements mostly linked to the recent
    cloud migration of their data infrastructure. She knew that none of this would
    resonate with her business stakeholders, so she had to construct a whole new narrative
    by herself, which she managed to do. This was when she realized that she was mostly
    alone in selling the business value of the data program to business executives
    and that the stories they would tell were not how the people in her team perceived
    their job at that point in time.

    technical complexities of data management and the practical business value that
    these initiatives are supposed to deliver. The role of the CDO, once a rarity
    found in only 12% of organizations in 2012, is now firmly established in 82% of
    firms, according to the NewVantage Partners Data and Analytics Leadership Annual
    Survey 2023\. The sheer complexity of data management has grown in parallel, making

    to execute. This complexity extends from developing intricate data pipelines,
    setting up sophisticated cloud storage systems, implementing strict governance
    frameworks, to cataloguing vast amounts of data. Undoubtedly, these tasks are
    significant accomplishments, marking crucial steps in the journey of a data programme.
  prefs: []

    data teams dive into the technical execution, the more they risk losing sight
    of why the programme exists in the first place — to generate business value. While
    a data programme’s technical accomplishments are crucial, they are means to an
    end, not the end itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of operational processes, not necessarily well designed to aid business decisions.
    This is why we need complex data programmes to make data usable for business decisions.
    But if the connection between the technicalities and the business value gets lost,
    the whole programme loses its purpose. This is the tension that needs addressing
    — aligning the technical intricacies of data management with clear, tangible business
    value.

    execution due to their inherent complexity, we have identified that these tasks
    are but means to an end. The complexity and the focus on technical tasks have
    inadvertently obscured the ultimate goal — driving business value. But how do
    we resolve this tension between technicality and business value? By putting **business

    to a business-first perspective. It’s about looking beyond the jargon, algorithms,

    technical task to a corresponding business goal and continually evaluating its

    of data sources integrated, if a data programme does not contribute positively
    to your company’s bottom line or other key performance indicators (KPIs), it is
    falling short of its primary purpose. That’s why taking a *business value first*
    approach is not just a strategic decision, but an essential shift in how data
    programmes should be assessed and executed.

    anomalies. Previously, their defect reporting process was inefficient, time-consuming,
    and error-prone. The implementation of the roaming PFS significantly reduced checking
    time and the number of technicians required per shift. As a result, the company
    saved £1.75 per vehicle, adding up to over £400,000 over the year — a clear illustration

    decreasing costs, or reducing risk. But the scope of business use cases extends

    objectives, such as promoting diversity or sustainability.

    At its height, data teams developed business use cases around workplace occupancy
    rates, air quality indexes, and other pandemic-related data. These use cases were
    of high value then but as we move into a post-pandemic era, the value of these
    specific use cases have diminished, making way for new priorities. While the capacity
    to respond swiftly to similar events still holds value, it is not as immediately
    or quantifiably significant as during the peak of the crisis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    squarely on the shoulders of the business stakeholders, not the data team. Business
    stakeholders are the ones who experience the operational impact of these use cases
    day in and day out. Their insights are crucial to gauging value and distinguishing
    between transient benefits, like a one-time cost reduction, and structural ones,
    such as a long-term increase in operational efficiency.

    in perception at different points in time. This ongoing assessment not only serves
    as a tool to fine-tune the execution of the data programme but also ensures it
    remains aligned with evolving business needs.
  prefs: []

    implementing business use cases. Striking a balance between the perceived value
    and the associated cost becomes crucial. Add to this the complexity introduced
    by the potential overlap in benefits between business use cases, or double-counting,
    and it’s clear the valuation process is far from simple.

    loop with business stakeholders. This open communication allows the data programme
    to continuously realign with the business’s realities and priorities, thereby
    ensuring its relevance and its consistent contribution to the bottom line. Through
    this constant engagement, we can cultivate a data programme that is technically
    robust and acutely attuned to the needs of the business.

    their value drivers, and the data requirements that enable them.

    among all stakeholders, from the most technical data engineers to the business
    users of the insights.

    that reflect the new focus on business value. This includes setting targets for
    business value creation, time to value, and overall alignment of tasks with business
    goals. The process of assessing business value itself should also be refined and
    improved over time, taking into account the evolving business context and lessons
    learned.
