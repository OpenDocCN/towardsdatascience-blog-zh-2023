- en: In time series forecasting is often helpful to inspect graphically the data
    at disposal. This helps us understand the dynamics of the phenomena we are analyzing
    and take decisions accordingly. Despite having a colorful plot with our time series
    may be fascinating, it may lead to incorrect conclusions. **Time series are tricky
    because often unrelated events may still be visually seen to be related**.

- en: As rational individuals, we can easily negate any sort of relationship between
    the *number of people who died by becoming tangled in their bedsheets* and *per
    capita cheese consumption*. **We can affirm being in presence of a false (spurious)
    correlation because there is nothing that can relate the two events**, even though
    we are not experts in both fields.

    we have difficulties interpreting the context and discriminating between true
    and wrong correlations. For this reason, the need for methodologies that help
    in discriminating against these…
