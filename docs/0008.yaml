- en: Imposter syndrome, frustration, doubt. These are just a few of the things I
    experienced while trying to make the jump from data analyst to data scientist
    in 2018\. In the five years since, advances in artificial intelligence have introduced
    world-changing technologies such as large language and [transformer models](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/),
    [diffusion models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/diffusion-models-for-machine-learning-introduction/),
    and improved [computer vision models](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sabbirrangwala/2022/10/04/advances-in-computer-vision-propel-transportation-autonomy/?sh=62e60f44147f).
    And while the amount and quality of resources to teach yourself data science has
    exploded in the past five years, the skills you need to transition from a data
    analysis to data science role remain the same.

- en: My jump from data analyst to data scientist was overwhelming. I had a limited
    understanding of my own qualifications, I had no idea whether or not I was applying
    for the right types of jobs, and I didn’t have a single person in the data science
    space I could ask for advice. This article contains everything I learned along
    my own journey and everything I wish I’d known from the start, including leveraging
    your current skills, how to teach yourself data science, the basic skills you
    need to master, and a host of specific (free) resources to transform yourself
    into a data scientist.
