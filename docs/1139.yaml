    you’re not alone. We doubt any period in human history could be described as uneventful,
    but the confluence of global crises, technological progress, and the proliferation
    of media has given our current moment a very specific—and occasionally overwhelming—texture.
    Everything! Everywhere! All at once!

    like to think about solutions and pragmatic approaches to the (many) problems
    our global community is facing, so [we recently put together a wide-ranging collection
    of 30 excellent articles](/special-feature-our-expanding-global-village-2d8355436d2c)
    that tackle topics like population analytics, sustainable agriculture, and urban
    planning. We also included a few public datasets in case you wanted to jump into
    the fray and start tinkering.

    Global Village](/special-feature-our-expanding-global-village-2d8355436d2c),”
    the special feature we shared earlier this month. We hope you’ll explore a few
    of our other picks, too, and that you’ll leave your reading inspired to learn
    more—and maybe even contribute to meaningful projects down the line. Enjoy!

    When we talk about planet-wide issues like population growth or climate change,
    it’s easy to lose track of the actual people who will consume (and be affected
    by) these conversations. [Emily A. Halford](https://medium.com/u/80e2e35ca93b?source=post_page-----13781b3a6088--------------------------------)’s
    overview of artist Norwood Viviano’s work does a great job connecting the dots
    between data, visual storytelling, and communicating complex messages.'

    With so much public data available for researchers, the challenge often lies in
    finding the right dataset and defining a reasonable scope for your project. [Aine
    Fairbrother-Browne](https://medium.com/u/f1056428905d?source=post_page-----13781b3a6088--------------------------------)

    data that highlights the aviation sector’s effects on the environment and the
    areas where it has the greatest potential to improve.'
