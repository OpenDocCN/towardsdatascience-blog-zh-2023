- en: Recently, I had an opportunity to meet with a data science team from a large
    government agency in Australia. From what I could tell, the team consisted of
    highly skilled individuals in data science and machine learning. However, during
    our conversation, I couldn’t help but notice a common theme among the data scientists.
    They seemed more interested in discussing the latest algorithms to predict human
    behavior rather than discussing and defining the core problems they were trying
    to solve.

    the tendency to see everything as a data science problem. It’s like having a hammer
    and seeing everything as a nail. While algorithms and advanced techniques can
    be powerful tools, it’s essential to remember that data scientists should be problem
    solvers first and foremost.'

    skills in data science and why they should be prioritized over algorithmic techniques.
    I will also discuss why it’s critical to understand organizational readiness when
    proposing data science solutions and how data scientists can lead their organizations…
