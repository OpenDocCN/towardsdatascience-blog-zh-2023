    excellent services, meaning the service should be healthy and functional whenever
    the customers access it. To achieve this, the tech industry introduced on-call
    duty which was often associated with doctors in the past.

    Being on-call means being available and ready to respond to production incidents
    with appropriate urgency during a certain period of time. On-call is often associated
    with Software Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) to support software
    such as APIs, websites, mobile apps, IoT services and etc.'

    as much as their peers. I will explain the reasons in a second. But this is going
    to change.

    set up an on-call culture in a data engineering team. Most of the experiences
    come from my current team, but I would like to hear how you do it in your team
    and any interesting thoughts down the line.
