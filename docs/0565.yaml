- en: Believe it or not, humans are constantly predicting things passively — even
    the most minuscule or seemingly trivial things. When crossing the road, we forecast
    where the cars will be to cross the road safely, or we try to predict exactly
    where a ball will be when we try to catch it. We don’t need to know the exact
    velocity of the car or the precise wind direction affecting the ball in order
    to perform these tasks — they come more or less naturally and obviously to us.
    These abilities are tuned by a handful of events, which over years of experience
    and practice allow us to navigate the unpredictable reality we live in. Where
    we fail in this regard, is when there are simply too many factors to take into
    consideration when we are actively predicting a large scale phenomenon, like the
    weather or how the economy will perform one year down the line.

    inability to take even the most seemingly random of occurrences and relate them
    to a future event. As we all know, computers are extremely good at doing a specific
    task over numerous iterations…
