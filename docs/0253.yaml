    can be even more challenging.

    not some fancy API usage or anything. It's how I format the code.

    ultimate goal. But as I progressed, I understood that good coding is much more
    than simply getting things done.

    to explain them. Other programmers found digesting my code very challenging, even
    with supporting documents and inline comments.

    warrant everyone who reads your Python code will understand it.
