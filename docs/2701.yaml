    talent pool too thin in a rush to decentralize and embed across the company (perhaps
    within a [data mesh](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up/)).
    While you gain a better understanding and proximity to the business, sustained

    the talent of one or two self-starters. Data science talent is scarce, senior
    data science talent that can independently identify, prioritize, communicate,
    and execute high value projects is even more rare.
  prefs: []

    and project momentum often leave with them. Their surviving team members are forced
    to take on the role of an archeologist, attempting to discern the purpose and

    from near scratch.

    science and machine learning teams. This consolidates a critical mass of talent
    that can be aimed at the highest priority projects. The potential downside to
    mitigate is you want to prevent the [center of excellence](https://medium.com/@shane.murray5/organizing-talent-return-of-the-data-center-of-excellence-3c6a2b4a3190)

- en: As a team grows bigger and ascends the maturity curve, slightly different organizational
    structures become more appropriate. The “specialized” model will typically focus
    data science and machine learning resources around a couple of high-valued problems,
    with teams deployed within the relevant business domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common expression of this occurs when machine learning is a core part
    of the product (perhaps personalization or fraud detection) and the association
    with the product or engineering team is more important than the association with
    the core data team. Often the core data team has its own investment in data science,
    largely independent from the specialized teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This model can be successful, but it does create inefficiencies and silos. For
    example, both central and specialized teams will typically have customized platforms
    with few shared services. The streaming event data within the product domain might
    benefit from being enriched by the custom data collected by the centralized team,
    but that connection might never be made.

    model. Embedded and specialized models can suffer from a lack of visibility and
    cohesion across business domains, treating each data science problem with its
    own full-stack solution, despite inherent similarities in the type of problems
    being solved across domains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution is to create some deliberate separation from business domains or
    verticals, so as to not overfit their operating model, as you would do with other
    horizontal platform teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A major benefit of treating machine learning as a platform pursuit is the capacity
    to invest in a shared platform infrastructure once you have demonstrated the value
    from each ML application, as it lowers the resource and cost to deploying and
    maintaining new applications. This investment should initially be small relative
    to the investment in applied teams, allowing them to operate relatively independently
    and pursue the long-term goals of their business partners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this platform model, a GenAI team could be created as one of the applied
    teams, with the mandate and engineering resources to tailor their stack as needed
    to deliver value, while coordinating with other platform teams to reuse infrastructure
    and standards that will deliver sustained value for the organization. I’d strongly
    recommend this model over trying to spread Gen AI across many teams. Critical
    mass matters.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science teams were working on the same types of projects within each domain,
    namely article recommendation algorithms. No doubt each domain benefits from the
    dedicated focus on their specific problems and each data science team benefits
    from the proximity to their respective business and editorial partners. But it
    helped highlight some of the downsides of this organizational structure; inefficient
    deployment of talent and a lack of shared infrastructure despite many teams solving
    the same types of content ranking problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the New York Times, we found it effective to organize our data science teams
    around common problems. Once the model had been proven in one domain, it was generally
    more efficient to tweak and modify it to the unique inputs and constraints of
    another rather than having two teams create two models in parallel. It makes sense
    from a logical perspective as well, it always takes more time to build the prototype
    than the subsequent product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gen AI should be considered in the same vein. Have a team focus on a high value
    use case appropriate for the technology, perhaps personalized seat suggestions
    for an event marketplace, or language localization for a media site, then apply
    that solution to other domains where it makes sense.

    learning and Gen AI initiatives can be expensive (although LLMs [are commoditizing
