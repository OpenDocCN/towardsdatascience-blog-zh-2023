    a key one. The ability to identify, recruit, train (and monetize) employees in

    people use to interact with the world around them. They are constructed by individuals
    based on their unique life experiences, perceptions, and understandings of the
    world. Mental models are used to reason and make decisions and can be the basis
    of individual behaviors. They provide the mechanism through which new information
    is filtered and stored.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Peoples’ ability to represent the world accurately, however, is always limited
    and unique to each individual. Mental models are therefore characterized as incomplete
    representations of reality. They are also regarded as inconsistent representations
    because they are context-dependant and may change according to the situation in
    which they are used. In essence, mental models have to be highly dynamical models
    to adapt to continually changing circumstances and to evolve over time through
    learning. Conceptualizing cognitive representations as dynamic, inaccurate models
    of complex systems acknowledges the limitations in peoples’ ability to conceive
    such complex systems.

    rest of the system; they therefore have visibility and capacity on the entire

    and machine learning software applications. From the paper:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional software development, first we gather requirements. We then design,
    develop, test, deploy and maintain the application. For ML systems, we still need
    to scope out the goal of the application, but instead of designing the the algorithm
    we let the ML model learn the desired logic from data [1]. Such observations lead
    to the question of whether and how ML models can be adopted without disrupting
    the software development life cycle (SDLC) of the [machine learning software applications].
    Ideally, ML workflow/pipeline and SDLC phases should go hand in hand to ensure
    proper quality assurance. However, as we noted above, such expectations can be
    unrealistic due to the inherent differences in how ML models are designed and
    how traditional software applications are developed.

    complete a similarly sized project. but AI software typically requires more sequential
    stacking of these principles, whereas Cloud and SaaS seem to have more concurrency
    in their ideas, which leads to less critical interdependencies between them.
