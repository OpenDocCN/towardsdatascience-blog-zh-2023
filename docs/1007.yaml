- en: Ever since being popularized by ChatGPT in late 2022, large language models
    (LLM) have attracted intense interest from the research and industry communities.
    While general chatbot is an obvious application of large language models, enterprises
    are thinking about how to integrate large language models into their business
    workflows to leverage this latest AI advance. **A fundamental premise of business
    specific integration though, is to be able to adapt the large language models
    to the bespoke business domain**, since LLMs are usually trained on open internet
    information, which contains too much noise and is not always closely relevant
    to the specific business context.

- en: While there are many good blog posts out there already detailing large language
    models themselves, there seems to be a lack of solid introduction on how to leverage
    LLMs. In this blog post, we examine a few canonical ways of adapting LLMs to domain
    specific tasks from recent research literature. The goal is to spark some inspiration
    to actually democratize LLMs and make them accessible to the wider world.
