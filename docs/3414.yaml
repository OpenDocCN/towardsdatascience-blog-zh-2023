    two additional ML books in the works. For one, [*Probabilistic Machine Learning:
    An Introduction*](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html), which is focused
    on deep learning, and a more advanced version thereof, with the title [*Probabilistic

    framework that sits on top of TensorFlow. Chollet is an exceptional author, those
    are not just my words. He’s doing a remarkable job at illustrating the mechanics
    behind the various concepts in deep learning and how they come together to form
    the basis of the field that is currently taking the world by storm (think of ChatGPT).

    deep learning, starting from first principles. I mainly used this book to learn
    about Keras, but I also found myself re-reading many other parts of the book (e.g.
    about convolutional neural networks, best prectices, etc). Even though I already
    knew most of the topics by the time I stumbled upon this book, I found them too
    good to miss out on, and so they reinforced my understanding of deep learning
    greatly.'

    all the concepts. If you already have some experience in deep learning, you might
    as well just pick a chapter to improve you understanding of a specific topic.'

    out earlier this year. Deep learning is moving extremely fast, so the book required
    some updates. It also comes with new chapters and topics. For example it contains
    new content to cover to the recent advancements in language models and text generation.
    Also, Keras has changed throughout the years, so the book had to adapt too.'

- en: If there’s one final tip from me — I’ve always been a fan of using multiple
    sources to learn the same concept. Different books (or courses, videos, and tutorials
    for that matter) all take a slightly different approach to teaching a topic. It’s
    like having multiple teachers, one always makes it click in your head, and once
    that happens, you’ll also understand what the others were saying. I think you
    get an incredibly profound understanding by doing that.

  zh: 如果有一个最后的建议——我一直都是使用多个信息源学习同一概念的忠实粉丝。不同的书籍（或课程、视频和教程）都会以稍微不同的方式来教授一个主题。就像有多位老师一样，总会有一位能让你豁然开朗，一旦这种情况发生，你也会理解其他人在说什么。我认为通过这样做你能获得非常深刻的理解。
