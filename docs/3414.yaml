- en: If there’s one final tip from me — I’ve always been a fan of using multiple
    sources to learn the same concept. Different books (or courses, videos, and tutorials
    for that matter) all take a slightly different approach to teaching a topic. It’s
    like having multiple teachers, one always makes it click in your head, and once
    that happens, you’ll also understand what the others were saying. I think you
    get an incredibly profound understanding by doing that.
