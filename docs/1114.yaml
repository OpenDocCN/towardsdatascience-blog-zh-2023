    scientist, and my first foray into data was centered on studying statistics and
    linear algebra, not software engineering or database management. Fairly early
    in my career, however, I realized that I enjoyed building data assets more than
    reports or ML models. If you’re interested in those early days, how I grew my
    career, and advice for newcomers to data, take a look at [my earlier article](https://medium.com/@cisenbe/data-careers-getting-motivated-working-on-soft-skills-and-finding-your-way-3600712010d6).

    fiction, poetry, non-fiction, non-fiction about fiction, non-fiction about non-fiction

    to be familiar with dimensional modeling concepts, and I personally don’t think
    there’s a better way than by going straight to the source. It’s possible that
    just having this on your bookshelf will make you a better data professional; it’s
    just that important.

    as a data analyst, and it was transformational. I ended up reading it cover-to-cover

    from reporting and analytics to modeling and building.

    you have a great set of tools to start solving business problems.

    workshop sponsored by [1904labs](https://medium.com/u/c51edc2962eb?source=post_page-----8d9db9a40691--------------------------------),
    a consultancy in the St. Louis area. At this point in my career, I had only been
    exposed to SQL and R, so this felt like a huge step forward. During the course,
    we got hands-on experience with Kafka, Scala, Spark, HBase, and Hive, and I was
    hooked. I wanted to know more about the platforms and underlying technologies
    upon which data assets were built.

    Kleppmann strikes an amazing balance between accessibility and depth. As someone
    who had minimal exposure to computer science, I felt it pretty easy to follow
    along with his explanations of encodings, database design (and tradeoffs), and
    distributed architecture. At the same time, I got a real sense of how various
    data technologies work.'

    a narrative structure that makes this reading strategy extremely effective. Even
    more than the technical details, I found the history of data technologies to be
    the most important takeaway; you get to understand the motivation behind the tools.
    Why do we have RDBMS? What problems do document stores solve? Why Spark and not
    Hadoop? Hands-on experience will give you the most insight into those answers,
    but *DDIA* comes in a close second.

    about trust and safety seem especially applicable to the modern data landscape,

    [site reliability engineering](https://sre.google/) practices to databases. For
    me, the most valuable takeaways are applying the reliability mindset to data stores.
    How do you standardize databases with “golden images”? What do error budgets look
    like? What does proper database instrumentation, monitoring, and observability
    look like? In short, what *really matters* when it comes to your databases / data
    warehouses?

- en: What the authors do best is provide a vision for elevating the DBA role from
    a purely operational one to a combination of operations and enablement. Yes, you
    still need someone who can provide operational support to your data stores, but
    there’s a huge amount of value to be had in democratizing them. When individual
    development teams can safely and easily spin up “blessed” assets, you reduce their
    friction, and you free up your database team to further refine automation and
    processes, all of which increases safety.
