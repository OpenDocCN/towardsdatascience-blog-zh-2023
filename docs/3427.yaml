    I have been enamored by geo visualizations from afar and dabbled a little myself,
    but I wanted to go deeper and learn how to build beautiful maps that tell stories.

    that I’ve conjured up using [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/),
    a JavaScript library for exploratory data visualization. You can find all of the
    visualizations along with data source and code in my [#30DayMapChallenge](https://observablehq.com/collection/@deepsha/30-day-map-challenge)
    collection. I used Observable Plot because I fell in love with the simplicity
    and ease of using it during the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-used-my-first-30daychartchallenge-to-learn-observable-plot-78141929e3e2)

- en: October is over, but the hauntings are not. For this theme, I chose to plot
    haunted places in the United States. I sourced the data from the [data.world](https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places)
    website, one of my favorite sources for dataset discovery. This dataset includes
    the latitude and longitude of every reported haunted location, making it perfect
    for plotting as “points.”

- en: I used the Albers projection to plot the map of the USA and gave it a black
    background for a striking contrast effect. The main goal for this plot was to
    not only draw points at each location but to create a sort of glowing effect to
    align with my “haunting” theme. To achieve this, I layered each reported location
    with three points stacked on top of each other. First, a large “red” point with
    minimal opacity, then an “orange” point with a smaller radius and higher opacity,
    and finally, a “white” point with the smallest radius and highest opacity. These
    layered points created the effect of a white point with a fiery aura and a glowing
    effect. While I don’t think this exact combination would create a similar effect
    on every plot, the closeness of all points in this plot created the perfect effect
    I was looking to achieve.

- en: My favorite way to navigate this country is by the Amtrak system, so for the
    theme of navigation, I decided to plot the Amtrak stations for the state with
    the most stations, California, with data from [data.world](https://data.world/adamhelsinger/amtrak-stations).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In visualizing California’s Amtrak station network, I aimed to highlight the
    connectivity and reach of rail travel within the Golden State. I chose a Mercator
    projection to accurately represent the network at the state level, with a color
    gradient background transitioning from the Pacific to the Southwest. Each station
    is marked by a ‘point,’ with major hubs distinguished by larger, more prominent
    markers. To further convey the spread and reach of the rail system, I overlaid
    the points with a Voronoi network diagram. This map serves not only as a tool
    for potential travelers but also as a testament to the infrastructure that facilitates
    movement across this vast state.

- en: The data provided a comprehensive list of water points, which I plotted using
    mercator projection to give an accurate representation of their distribution.
    The map’s dark background allows the water source points to stand out, drawing
    attention to regions with higher water source density. I plotted these locations
    as a Raster map to add a layer of texture. This map doesn’t just show locations;
    it tells a story of access, where the clustering of points can indicate areas
    of potential water stress or abundance.

    Election Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/) via [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-11-07/readme.md),

    and engaging. I opted for a grid layout, with each state’s voting trends represented
    by mini bar charts that allow for immediate visual comparison across years and
    states. The color-coding is straightforward — blue for Democrats, red for Republicans,
    and grey for others — to provide clear insights into the political landscape at
    a glance. This map functions as a visual history of American politics, showing
    shifts and patterns that might not be apparent from numbers alone.

    movement. The data included timestamped locations of tagged vultures, which allowed
    me to plot their journey over time. I chose a dark background to symbolize the
    vast area covered, with migration paths highlighted by a color gradient that easily
    allows the eyes to track the pattern. This map isn’t static; it’s designed to
    represent the ebb and flow of migration, with larger, more concentrated points
    possibly indicating key resting areas. It offers a glimpse into the patterns of
    nature and serves as a tool for conservationists tracking the health of these
    migratory routes.

    because of how easily it facilitates the observation of a clear pattern of migration.
    There is so much more that can be done with this data, and I feel I have barely
    scratched the surface.

    with darker hues indicating greater freedom. This color choice is symbolic, with
    green being associated with ‘proceed’ in many cultures, suggesting areas where
    political rights are advancing. Beyond its aesthetic value, this map serves as
    an analytical tool, presenting a snapshot of a complex and evolving political
    climate.
