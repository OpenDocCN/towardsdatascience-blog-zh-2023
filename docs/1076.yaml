    explores and groups a set of vectors (or data points) in such a way that vectors
    in the same cluster are more similar to one another than to those in other clusters.
    Clustering algorithms are widely used in numerous applications, e.g., data analysis,
    pattern recognition, and image processing.'

    onto Convex Sets (POCS), called POCS-based clustering algorithm. The original
    paper was introduced in [IWIS2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9920762)
    and the source code has also been released on [Github](https://github.com/tranleanh/pocs-based-clustering).

- en: A convex set is defined as a set of data points in which a line segment connecting
    any two points x1 and x2 in the set is completely subsumed in this set. Following
    that definition of a convex set, empty set ∅, singleton set, line segment, hyperplane,
    and Euclidian ball are considered to be convex sets. A data point is also considered
    to be a convex set as it is a singleton set (a set with exactly one element).
    That directs to a new path that the concept of POCS can be applied to clustering
    data points.

    point within the intersection of the sets. A graphical illustration is shown below.

    simultaneously from the data point onto all the convex sets and each projection
    has a weight of importance. For two non-empty intersection convex sets, similarly
    to the alternating version, the parallel projections converge to a point in the
    intersection of the sets.

    a minimization solution. The main idea of the POCS-based clustering algorithm
    came up from this property.

- en: Taking advantage of the convergence property of the parallel POCS method, the
    authors proposed a very simple yet effective (to some extent) clustering algorithm.
    The algorithm operates in a similar spirit to the classical K-Means algorithm,
    but there is a difference in the way each one treats each data point, i.e., the
    K-Means algorithm treats each data point with equally weighted importance, however,
    the POCS-based clustering algorithm, on the other hand, treats each data point
    with a different weight of importance which is directly proportional to the distance
    from the data point to the cluster prototype. That’s it!
