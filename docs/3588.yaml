    insights](/generating-more-quality-insights-per-month-0d932930d99c). I presented
    how you could increase the output of your team by working on areas such as processes,
    tools, culture, etc., but I never defined what I meant by “quality” — so this
    week, we’ll do a deep-dive into this concept.

    jump to “making sure the data analysis is sound and the results are reliable”.
    I believe this is just one part of the definition. From my 8+ years of experience
    in analytics, for a data analysis to be “good work” — it has to be a blend of

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a data analysis to be truly impactful, it’s crucial that it targets a genuine,
    well-defined need. This means understanding exactly what problem is being addressed,
    identifying who it affects, recognizing why it’s relevant at this specific moment,
    and being clear on how the results of the analysis will be concretely used. The
    precision of this understanding directly correlates with the value your analysis
    brings to your end users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it is vital to pinpoint an actual need — as opposed to a perceived one.
    This will ensure that the analysis is not just theoretically useful but practically
    applicable. It will ensure that on the last day of the project, when you present
    it to your stakeholder — you don’t get questions such as “so… what now?”. It makes
    the difference between providing insightful, actionable data and offering information
    that, while interesting, may not be immediately beneficial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    broadly, but the actual need could be understanding the purchasing patterns of
    a specific age group. The latter directly influences marketing strategies and
    inventory decisions, thereby having a more profound impact on business operations.
  prefs: []

    two key elements: the relevance of the need at the current time, and the speed
    of providing the analysis.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Relevance of the Need:** The needs of businesses are often time-sensitive
    and can evolve rapidly — especially if you are in a fast-paced organization. An
    analysis that addresses a current pressing issue is far more valuable than one
    that arrives too late, or one that has been done too early. For example, an analysis
    of consumer trends in the lead-up to a major holiday season can be invaluable
    for a business in terms of stocking and marketing, but if it comes after the season
    has started, the opportunity is lost.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Promptness of Analysis:** The speed at which the analysis is delivered is
    equally critical — as that feeds into the relevance of the need. And this is an
    important factor to take into account, as sometimes you might have to make trade-offs
    between thoroughness of the study vs speed (e.g. if there is a new trend on social
    media and your company wants an analysis to capitalize on a viral topic — you
    can’t take 2 months to come back with results).'
  prefs:

    when it precisely identifies and addresses a real, current need and when it is
    delivered in a timely fashion, ensuring maximum relevance and impact.

    And while this doesn’t necessarily mean the study won’t be good, you highly reduce
    your chance of making high quality work by not following a proven methodology.

    the credibility and replicability of the analysis.

    for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. After almost a decade in the field, that’s
    still my go-to framework when starting an analysis from scratch. This framework
    — which is said to be the standard “data science” / “data analysis” process —
    has 6 main phases:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in understanding the “business context” of the ask: what is the pain point we’re
    trying to solve, what did we do in the past, who are the “actors”, what are the
    risks, resources, etc. — and also very importantly, what would be the success
    criteria for the project.'

    modeling can be as easy as “creating a certain threshold” for a true/false metric
    (for instance, if your project is understanding/defining churn). During this phase,
    various modeling techniques are applied to the prepared data, so that you can
    benchmark them against each other and understand which ones are the most successful
    ones.'

    your slide deck easier to understand. It involves two integral aspects: (1) fostering
    a deep level of comprehension from the audience, and (2) enabling them to apply
    these insights in a practical, impactful manner. This process is akin to how the
    body not only breaks down food but also utilizes the nutrients to fuel various

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Achieving this requires making the data accessible and resonanting with the
    audience. This is where subject matter experts (SMEs) play a crucial role. By
    involving SMEs early in the analysis process, their domain knowledge can guide
    the framing and interpretation of the data, ensuring that the analysis aligns
    with real-world contexts and is presented in a way that is meaningful to the intended
    audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key strategy to enhance digestibility is the implementation of a ‘stage-gate’
    process, involving regular check-ins and updates with the stakeholder or receiving
    team. This approach avoids overwhelming them with a bulk of complex information
    at the end of the study. Instead, stakeholders are brought along on the journey,
    allowing them to assimilate new insights gradually. It also opens avenues for
    continuous feedback, ensuring that the analysis remains aligned with the evolving
    needs and expectations of the audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you are in a large organization implementing a new data-driven strategy.
    If the data team only presents the final analysis without prior engagement, stakeholders
    may find it challenging to grasp the nuances or see its relevance to their specific
    contexts. However, by involving these stakeholders at regular intervals — through
    periodic presentations or workshops — they become more familiar with the data
    and its implications. They can offer valuable feedback, steering the analysis
    towards areas most pertinent to them, thus ensuring that the final output is not
    just understandable but immediately actionable and tailored to their needs.

    applications or decisions. It’s about ensuring that the audience can effectively
    utilize the insights to drive tangible results. It is about really thinking about
    the “last mile” between your analysis and real-life impact, and how you can help
    remove any friction to adopt your insights.

    churn — making your study more digestible might include you creating a dashboard
    allowing your business stakeholders to understand what concretely your results
    looks like.

    etc. — anything to make it easier for the team to hit the ground running.

    by involving SMEs from the outset and maintaining ongoing communication with stakeholders.
    This collaborative approach ensures that the study is not only comprehensible
    but also directly relevant and valuable to those it is intended to benefit.

    alignment, and practical applicability. It’s not just about following a set of
    steps but understanding and adapting those steps to the unique context of each
    project. Timeliness, proper execution, and addressing real organizational needs
    are the pillars that support the bridge connecting data analysis with organizational
    success. The ultimate goal is to transform data into actionable insights that
    drive value and inform strategic decision-making.
