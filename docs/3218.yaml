- en: Back in the beginning of the 21st century, when I studied for MBA at NYU Stern,
    one class I took was called Data Mining, which introduced many algorithms to “mine”
    the data, meaning to automatically find the meaning of the data for forecasts
    and decision making. The neural network was one of them, but it was far from the
    top choices because it was slow, required a lot of data to train, and, hence,
    had minimal use cases. Twenty years later, neural network algorithms have thrived
    as the cornerstones of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) due to
    the tremendous computational power that removed the fundamental obstacle and,
    in turn, led to the invention of more advanced algorithms and models.

- en: With the fast advances in artificial neural networks and deep learning, AI has
    surpassed humans in certain areas. Many intriguing questions have arisen, such
    as how similar AI and the human brain are, what the future objective of AI is,
    and to what degree AI can replace human intelligence. In this article, I will
    start with the neural mechanisms of biological learning and how they have inspired
    AI. A better understanding of the history will help us grasp the fundamental difference
    between artificial neural networks and other machine learning models (e.g., support
    vector machines, decision trees, random forests). It was the learning features
    inspired by the brain…
