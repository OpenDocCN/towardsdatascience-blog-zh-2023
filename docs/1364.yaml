    that is going to bring the company a lot of money. The next step is to send it
    to production. You spend some days making the code [***PEP***](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    compliant, applying [***linting***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29),
    etc. Finally, you create a [***pull request***](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
    on GitHub excited about your new release. Then, a Software Engineer asks: ‘*I
    don’t see any tests here?’*'

    [***Testing***](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) is an essential part of
    any software project and Data Science is no different. Therefore, it is an important
    concept and tool to nail down as it will be invaluable in your career. In this
    post, I dive into the need for testing and how we can easily carry them out by
    using [***Pytest***](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/).

    we have expected which is called [***exploratory testing***](https://www.guru99.com/exploratory-testing.html).
    However, this is not ideal especially when you have a large codebase with numerous
    steps, as it would be hard to detect where the problem is occurring.
