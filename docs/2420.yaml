- en: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are being increasingly used in
    educational and professional settings. It is important to understand and study
    the many biases present in such models before integrating them into existing applications
    and our daily lives.

- en: One of the biases I studied in my [previous article](https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/world-history-through-ai)
    was regarding historical events. I probed LLMs to understand what historical knowledge
    they encoded in the form of major historical events. I found that they encoded
    a serious Western bias towards understanding major historical events.

- en: On a similar vein, in this article, I probe language models regarding their
    understanding of important historical figures. I asked two LLMs who the most important
    historical people in history were. I repeated this process 10 times for 10 different
    languages. Some names, like Gandhi and Jesus, appeared extremely frequently. Other
    names, like Marie Curie or Cleopatra, appeared less frequently. Compared to the
    number of male names generated by the models, there were extremely few female
    names.
