- en: Recently, I’ve been trying to come up with some legal advice on how one could
    implement a chatbot without stepping on any of the landmines in the European regulatory
    minefield. In my process, I always like to look at “How the others do it”, however,
    when it comes to this particular question, this was quite a disappointing avenue
    to take. It appears that when it comes to the technology now implemented on every
    third website and offering advice on everything from law to cooking, there is
    just not that much written on how the bots should be implemented. And when I say
    should, I don’t mean the best cybersecurity and security tips or the best fine-tuning
    or training tips. I mean how, when and for what can I use a bot, which data can
    I use to train it, as well as how and what information do I need to share with
    the users so that my bot is at least somewhat compliant with most of the European
    regulations? (European, just to keep things relatively simple, however, most of
    the suggestions I make should also be considered as a matter of common decency
    towards the users.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As simple as this one may sound, it is far from a trivial question. The options
    are manifold and include choosing to build your own chatbot using open-sourced
    code.[[1](#_ftn1)] Using one of the gazillion chatbot APIs offered on the market,
    that allow you the simplest and quickest ready-set-go set-up.[[2](#_ftn2)] Finetuning
    your own chatbot based on one of those APIs.[[3](#_ftn3)] Finetuning your chatbot
    using various chatbot tools.[[4](#_ftn4)] Or just paying someone to do it all
    for you by opting for a Chatbot as a Service. [[5](#_ftn5)]
  prefs: []

- en: Choosing any single one of these options doesn’t come without its ripple effects.
    And these ripple effects of course include performance and flexibility in setting
    up the bot, but also the particularities of conforming with legal obligations.
    So for instance, developing your own bot from scratch or relying solely on open-sourced
    code is definitely the safest option data protection-wise, as you control all
    the training data and the data isn’t flowing anywhere else. However, this is not
    without its downsides and one should only jump into this frying pan if one has
    enough expert resources to set the thing up and running while guaranteeing a certain
    level of performance. Conversely, relying on APIs always entails a certain level
    of risk of possible data leakage. Not to mention you rely on someone else’s performance
    and are at least in the first line responsible for their mistakes as well (GDPR
    joint-controllership alert). The situation of course getting even more complex
    when yet another tool is used for finetuning for instance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest option then probably turns out to be leaving the mess to someone
    else and just buying the product or rather service. However, aside from being
    the most expensive way to go (especially if you want a highly personalized bot),
    this option also has its pitfalls and one should then choose which particular
    bot to hire VERY carefully while taking into consideration all publicly shared
    information on the data processing practices, training data used etc. Or again
    land back in the fire for failing to comply with due diligence obligations.

    some finetuning from your side, congratulations! You just jumped from the frying
    pan straight into the fire. Regardless of whether you use one of the tools for
    automated finetuning or you take open-sourced code, roll up your sleeves and get
    the hands dirty yourself, which data you feed into the model is just as important
    as choosing the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are all already familiar with the whole garbage-in-garbage-out agenda, but
    there is another maybe more important agenda to be considered. And that is the
    legally-problematic-stuff-in-non-negligible-risk-of-legal-action-out. We already
    familiarized ourselves with this concept through the lawsuits of artists and newspapers
    against the biggest LLM providers. And the very likely scenario is that once the
    legal situation has cleared up there, the lawsuits may proliferate to anyone 1\.
    Using their products or services and 2\. Doing a similar thing. The key takeaway
    being, of course, to keep track of the legal developments in the field and to
    not feed your model with (likely) unlawful data. We can also add one bonus takeaway
    to this, avoid feeding your model personal data at all times. Aside from the copyright
    debate for a second, using personal data where not absolutely necessary will always
    get you into trouble.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One final possibility and potential problem to consider is that nowadays you
    don’t even need to finetune your model. You can continually finetune it so to
    say, by performing further API calls or website calls where you can fetch the
    data for the bot’s responses. If that is the case, make sure to respect any limitations
    to the use of data imposed by the original website provider. These limitations
    can come in the form of robots.txt files but also just be stated in their Terms
    and Conditions. Yes, even crawling and linking has its limits.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there is one thing that law experts cannot get enough of that is ‘disclaimers’.
    So make sure to implement a fair number of those together with your chatbot. Two
    absolute non-negotiables being that the person interacting with an AI system needs
    to be made aware of the fact before they can even interact with it, as well as
    of the fact that outputs can be inaccurate and shouldn’t be relied upon. These
    two can be nicely packed together in the form of a pop-up, but should also remain
    continuously visible somewhere on the website or the user could be repeatedly
    reminded of their existence. Better overly transparent than sorry applies here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the same goes for the privacy notice, the whole notice itself being a sort
    of disclaimer. Although the workings of a large language model require a computer
    science degree to be somewhat understandable, you are still required to try and
    make them understandable within the limited scope of the privacy notice. Imagine
    explaining what the model does to your six-year-old or maybe your grandparents
    and take it from there. Pictures, videos and graphics are most welcome. On the
    other hand, if you are using any of the APIs or automated tools mentioned in Step
    1, you are of course free to link the privacy notices of the relevant service
    provider(s), but that still doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. In this particular
    context, you are the one offering the service and being the first contact point
    for questions and complaints. Therefore, it is your responsibility to explain
    where the users’ data is flowing, why that is necessary and how they can stop
    the processing. And this again requires some skill as well as creativity, in order
    to be done transparently and adequately. Good luck cracking your brains over that
    one!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we finally made it to the outputs, so surely we must be approaching the
    end. If you were thinking that, you were correct! Well at least somewhat. This
    one still is a whole separate mountain to climb. And apart from the already mentioned
    disclaimer, stating that the results might be incorrect, there are a couple more
    things to consider, because there are multiple reasons for the possible incorrectness.
    The first one is of course the infamous hallucinations of LLMs, due to their inherent
    lack of understanding of the data we so graciously feed them. And, besides praying
    that some very smart people figure out how to fix that, there is not much else
    we can do about the issue other than implementing our disclaimer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other side of the coin, however, we have something different, which will
    apply to all chatbots crawling other websites to find and output information.
    So now you have to ask yourself what happens if the scrapped information is false
    or even illegal. For situations like these, it might be best to rely on the so-called
    Hosting exception contained in Article 14 of the now already ancient e-commerce
    directive. This exception, which also applies to search engines for example, guarantees
    that hosts and intermediaries are not liable for the content they simply provide
    access to. This, however, only applies if it wasn’t obvious that the content was
    unlawful. So, to maximally simplify this down. First, only crawl and scrape trustworthy
    information sources you checked beforehand (don’t try and play Google). Second,
    make sure to integrate references in all your chatbot’s outputs, so the original
    sources for all information are immediately visible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One last thing worth considering and putting some extra coding hours into is
    integrating follow-up questions for situations when the user’s initial input was
    very broad or unclear. In this way, your bot can *re-prompt* the user so to say,
    so that the user offers a better prompt in response. This will in turn make the
    model produce better outputs as a result. Both accuracy and performance-wise.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And for the end just to nail this one down again, because it appears it always
    comes down to this. Pay special attention to the quality of your bot’s outputs,
    as this is one of their most prominent and definitely most noticeable issues.
    It was the controversy in the Italian ChatGPT temporary ban, where inaccurate
    outputs were meant to prove the inaccuracy of the training data.[[6](#_ftn6)]
    Hallucinations, as an output deficiency, were and always remain one of the main
    concerns, also still preventing the chatbots from entering the domain of search
    engines.[[7](#_ftn7)] And we are not going to even enter the algorithmic bias/garbage-in-garbage-out
    debate.[[8](#_ftn8)]
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The accuracy and quality of the outputs, aside from hallucinations, which remain
    a separate riddle, can be greatly enhanced by paying special attention to the
    accuracy and quality of the training data. As well as the relevance of that data.
    Furthermore, in case you are actively fetching data through API calls or in any
    other way for that matter, the data you are fetching should also be double-checked
    for accuracy, representativity, as well as appropriateness. Finally, you should
    have appropriate mechanisms in place for identifying any necessary updates or
    any changes necessitating an update of your data sets and, of course, some mechanisms
    for adequately responding to such identified events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quality is an ongoing concern, not a one-time box to be ticked off the checklist.
    All this comes at a cost, primarily timewise, making the development process slower.
    However, quality should always come before speed, as not everyone can afford to
    ‘move fast and break things’.[[9](#_ftn9)] At least not, if they are trying to
    develop a sustainable and responsible business model.

- en: Although I generally advocate for a more thought-driven and responsible approach
    to innovation, it appears the industry is leaning more towards the ‘move fast
    and break things’ mantra, with the hamster wheel spinning ever faster. Nobody
    wants to lose one of the most important races of our time. However, while OpenAI
    is busy trying to develop AGI and lawyers are scrambling to define what an AI
    system is, there are seemingly much less relevant questions on the minds of a
    lot of start-ups and commercial actors. Questions, which, however, lose all their
    triviality once we consider their scale and the number of actors they affect.
    One such question is how do I develop and implement a chatbot while stepping in
    as few legal mud puddles as possible? Hopefully, this article can help some of
    the people, trying to do things the right way, to start in the right direction.
