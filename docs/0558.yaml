    was that they wanted to monetize their data directly such as by selling it on
    a data marketplace. However, today, such marketplaces tend to mostly contain data
    created by companies that specialize in aggregating data across many sources (e.g.
    retail footfall, credit card receipts, product reviews). Few companies have found
    success monetizing their 1st party data.

    a product? There are several competing, but complementary, definitions. The [Tableau
    definition](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/turn-data-products-data-scientist-data-business-owner)
    — any application or tool that uses data to help businesses improve their decisions
    and processes is a data product — emphasizes the *usefulness* of data. The [McKinsey
    definition](https://hbr.org/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work) — a
    high-quality, ready-to-use set of data that people across an organization can
    easily access and apply to different business challenges — emphasizes *standardization*.
    The [Montecarlo definition](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-how-to-treat-your-data-as-a-product/)
    — that data is available within the company in a form that’s usable (even if the
    final mile involves self-service transformations) — emphasizes data *governance*.

    running out at the warehouse level? Or at the company level? These form the prioritization
    criteria. If someone asks you to customize the inventory model for perishable
    goods, is it worth doing? You will initially add it to a product backlog. Then,
    you’ll do product discovery to determine the ROI of doing such a project — this
    will include the cost of increasing/decreasing refrigeration at the warehouses,
    for example. Only when you know the value will you add this to your product roadmap.

    that the need for the product has been validated by potential (internal or external)
