    outputs that affect peoples lives… There are many different ways harm can be done
    with a data product or machine learning model. Unfortunately, there are** [**many
    examples**](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815)
    **where it did go wrong. On the other hand, many projects are innocent: no sensitive
    data is used and the projects only improve processes or automate boring tasks.
    When there is a possibility they can do harm, you should invest time at the topics
    of this post.**'

- en: Yes, ethics in data isn’t the most exciting subject you can think of. But if
    you want to use data in a responsible way, you might be interested in different
    ways to ensure this. This post contains six important ethics topics and ways to
    investigate how your model is doing. There are practical tools available to help
    you with this. Besides the harm that can be done to individuals, another important
    reason to take responsibility is that ethical considerations can impact trust
    and credibility in technology. If technology is not seen as trustworthy and transparent,
    it may harm its adoption and impact its effectiveness. People lose their trust
    and don’t want to use AI products anymore.
