- en: “Feature store” has been around for a few years. There are both open-source
    solutions (such as [Feast](https://feast.dev/) and [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/open-source-hopsworks)),
    and commercial offerings (such as [Tecton](https://www.tecton.ai/), [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/open-source-hopsworks),
    [Databricks Feature Store)](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/feature-store/index.html)
    for “feature store”. There have been a lot of articles and blogs published around
    what “feature store” is, and why “feature store” is valuable. Some organizations
    have also already adopted “feature store” to be part of their ML applications.
    However, it is worthwhile to point out that “feature store” is another component
    added to your overall ML infrastructure, which requires extra investment and effort
    to both build and operate. Therefore it is necessary to truly understand and discuss
    ***“is Feature Store really necessary for every organization?”***. In my opinion,
    the answer is, as usual, it depends.

    needed, so that organizations can wisely invest effort and resources in ML technologies
    that can actually add value to their business.
