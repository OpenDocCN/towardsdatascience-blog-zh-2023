    the various generative models, such as the new Mistral AI’s model that just came
    out. The reduction in size opens the door to getting your own personal assistant
    AI enabled that can be tied to you through your local computer. This type of local
    inference is very tempting to ensure confidential computation on your data. With
    all these new developments, deploying and managing an AI workload looks different
    than it did 6 months ago and is constantly evolving. How to use one of these models
    to play around with it or even to host it on your company’s infrastructure?

    else, it is a good thing to experiment with different type of models to get a
    sense of how these different model families perform. So let’s assume you are not
    using an API model right away. How do you pull down a model and use it?

    proprietary models will be OpenAI, Cohere and so on and they all have their own
    API. The open access ones can be fully open or half-restricted models due to…'
