    called “the fishbowl” owing to the windows that line its walls, allowing passers
    by to peer in. It was 4pm on a Friday afternoon, the only time all of my committee
    members could attend. After the inevitable AV hiccups, I presented to friends,
    family, and physicists for roughly an hour on “The Surprising Persistence of Symmetry
    Protected Topology”. Then, a brief private session with my defense committee,
    digging into the technical details of my research projects to probe the depth
    of my understanding. At 5:30, I walked out of the room with my Doctorate of Philosophy
    in Physics.

    five years of coursework, teaching, and research; of long days struggling to parse
    impenetrable equations and long nights responding to questions in referee reports;

    omnipresent fear that I wasn’t going to make it.

    For one sparing moment, I could be proud of myself.

    my cohort of budding physicists, this was a rather peculiar sentiment. Now, most
    of my classmates have graduated and others as well have left the academy. But
    for most this was not their original intent. From the outset, I had resolved to
    go into industry after the degree. In fact, this is largely *why* I chose to pursue
    my graduate studies in the San Francisco Bay Area!

    my decisions have been driven by my obsession with concepts like symmetry, order,
    universality, and emergence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This obsession led me to study physics, mathematics, and philosophy as an undergrad
    (as a side note, this means I have a bachelors in physics and philosophy, and
    a doctor of philosophy in physics, which I always thought was fun!); to work with
    Stephen Wolfram at Wolfram Research; and to pursue a Ph.D. in condensed matter
    theory, a subfield of physics concerned with how the interplay between order and
    symmetry can result in new phases of matter.

    wasn’t just the subject I studied or an umbrella for ideas I found endlessly fascinating;
    it was a part of my identity. Physicshas informed the way I approach new problems
    and the way I engage with physical reality. It has shaped how I see the world
    and my place in it.

    the scene. Antiquated though it may be, the doctorate serves as proof of membership
    in the community of academic scholars; a validation that years of “training” in
    the subject matter, motifs, and minutiae of a discipline have paid off.

    my personal and professional networks, looking for others who had recently made
    the transition from theoretical physics to industry. I reached out to everyone
    I could, across industries, roles, and stages of career, and was pleasantly surprised
    by how receptive and responsive most people were.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bigger surprise came from listening to their stories. Most of the ex-physicists
    in industry whom I spoke with were satisfied with where they were in their careers
    by the five year mark post-Ph.D. — and some far earlier on than that. But when
    reflecting on their journeys, the prevailing sentiment everyone expressed was
    a combination of frustration, disappointment, humility, and regret.

- en: In physics, it is common to be told that *from* physics, you can go on to do
    *anything*. People look around and see an ex-quantum physicist in finance; a researcher
    from CERN who is now the head of AI research at a tech company; a once-upon-a-time
    string theorist now masquerading as an oceanographer, and they think physics prepares
    you for everything, all at once. “They” are not wrong, but this picture is deceptive.

    is an invaluable foundation for more than a few careers. Speaking from my own
    experience, and from the conversations I had with others, however, I think it
    is less about the preparation that *physics* gives the person, and more about
    the *person* who is drawn to physics.

- en: No matter what field you are trying to transition into, there are people who
    have spent years studying and honing their craft. Physics is not a substitute
    for skills, and it certainly is not a substitute for knowledge. In fact, there
    is no substitute for putting in the time. And most companies, it turns out, hire
    for skills — especially during a recession.

    in prestigious journals, bathing in oceans of mathematical equations, and learning
    how to approach ambiguous research problems, so many physicists entering industry
    had trouble finding a job.

    Others expressed shame that the only jobs they were even given interviews for

    frustrated by their belief that they would have been just as capable of doing
    said job before their doctoral studies.

    skills. Looking back on this, I completely understand what they meant, and why
    I did not end up receiving these offers.
