    called “the fishbowl” owing to the windows that line its walls, allowing passers
    by to peer in. It was 4pm on a Friday afternoon, the only time all of my committee
    members could attend. After the inevitable AV hiccups, I presented to friends,
    family, and physicists for roughly an hour on “The Surprising Persistence of Symmetry
    Protected Topology”. Then, a brief private session with my defense committee,
    digging into the technical details of my research projects to probe the depth
    of my understanding. At 5:30, I walked out of the room with my Doctorate of Philosophy
    in Physics.

    a doctor of philosophy in physics, which I always thought was fun!); to work with
    Stephen Wolfram at Wolfram Research; and to pursue a Ph.D. in condensed matter
    theory, a subfield of physics concerned with how the interplay between order and
    symmetry can result in new phases of matter.

- en: More importantly, for years I’ve thought of myself as a *physicist*. Physics
    wasn’t just the subject I studied or an umbrella for ideas I found endlessly fascinating;
    it was a part of my identity. Physicshas informed the way I approach new problems

- en: For many aspiring physicists, the doctoral defense marks one’s emergence onto

    in industry whom I spoke with were satisfied with where they were in their careers
    by the five year mark post-Ph.D. — and some far earlier on than that. But when
    reflecting on their journeys, the prevailing sentiment everyone expressed was

- en: In physics, it is common to be told that *from* physics, you can go on to do
    *anything*. People look around and see an ex-quantum physicist in finance; a researcher
    from CERN who is now the head of AI research at a tech company; a once-upon-a-time
    string theorist now masquerading as an oceanographer, and they think physics prepares

- en: Sure, there are ex-physicists all over the place. And sure, the “physics mindset”
    is an invaluable foundation for more than a few careers. Speaking from my own
    experience, and from the conversations I had with others, however, I think it

- en: No matter what field you are trying to transition into, there are people who
    have spent years studying and honing their craft. Physics is not a substitute
    for skills, and it certainly is not a substitute for knowledge. In fact, there

  zh: '**学习是核心**：作为开发者推广员的一部分，持续学习和探索新技术是非常重要的，而机器学习如今发展如此迅速，以至于*每个人*都需要不断学习以保持与时俱进。因此，学习曾经是（并且仍然是！）这份工作的核心组成部分。通过与Voxel51的合作，我和Voxel51成功地将一个潜在的弱点（知识的空白）转化为优势，通过创建源自我经历的教育内容！'
- en: '**Startup mindset**: when large companies hire, they are often looking for
    someone to perform a very specific set of tasks. Consequently, they are looking
    for someone with a very specific set of skills and experiences. In a startup,
    everyone has to wear multiple hats, and there are many ways an individual can
    create value. It’s not always so cut and dry, but in general I’ve seen people
    with non-traditional skill-sets — including Ph.D.s — thrive in the flexible, often
    ambiguous, and ever-changing environment of a startup.'

  zh: '**创业公司思维**：当大型公司招聘时，他们通常寻找能够完成非常具体任务的人。因此，他们会寻找具备非常特定技能和经验的人。在创业公司中，每个人都必须身兼多职，个人可以创造价值的方式有很多。这并不总是那么明确，但通常来说，我发现具有非传统技能集——包括博士学位的人——在灵活、常常模糊不清和不断变化的创业环境中能够蓬勃发展。'
- en: 'I’ve been at Voxel51 for almost nine months, and I’ve already learned so much.
    I’ve learned about software engineering, computer vision, and generative AI; and
    I’ve learned about marketing, developer relations, and community management. I’ve
    also learned a lot about myself: what types of work excite me, how I collaborate
    with others, and how to balance work with life (still a work in progress). I’ve
    learned as much in the past year as I learned in any single year of grad school.
    And I’m still learning so much!'

  zh: 我在Voxel51待了将近九个月，已经学到了很多东西。我学习了软件工程、计算机视觉和生成性AI；我还学习了市场营销、开发者关系和社区管理。我还学到了很多关于自己的事情：哪些类型的工作让我感到兴奋，我如何与他人合作，以及如何平衡工作与生活（仍在进行中）。在过去的一年里，我学到的知识与研究生阶段的任何一年一样多。我仍然在不断学习！
- en: A year removed from the physics Ph.D., the resentment is finally starting to
    subside. I was so upset with myself for spending five years conducting physics
    research that I missed the bigger picture. I didn’t pursue a Ph.D. in physics
    to get ahead in my career. I chose to undertake the Ph.D. because I love physics,
    and I wanted the opportunity to dig deeper into fundamental questions about our
    universe. The fact that I was able to do so is a luxury — one for which I am exceedingly
    grateful.

  zh: 距离物理博士学位已经过去一年，心中的怨恨终于开始减退。我曾因为花费五年时间进行物理研究而对自己非常不满，以至于忽视了更大的图景。我并不是为了职业发展才攻读物理博士学位。我选择攻读博士学位是因为我热爱物理，并且我想有机会深入探索关于我们宇宙的基本问题。能够做到这一点是一种奢侈——对此我深感感激。
- en: I’m grateful to my advisor for funding me and allowing me to pursue projects
    that interested me, and I’m grateful for the mentorship I received from postdocs
    and professors. I published peer-reviewed papers, contributing (if ever-so-slightly)
    to the vast body of scientific knowledge. I gained both a deeper and broader grasp
    of physics. And I met so many cool people doing tremendous work within and beyond
    physics.

  zh: 我感激我的导师资助我，并允许我从事我感兴趣的项目，也感激我从博士后和教授那里获得的指导。我发表了经过同行评审的论文，为庞大的科学知识体系做出了（即便是微不足道的）贡献。我对物理学有了更深刻、更广泛的理解。我还结识了许多在物理学及其他领域做出杰出工作的酷人。
- en: There’s also so much more that I’m grateful for which indirectly resulted from
    pursuing the Ph.D. in physics. I interned as a Ph.D. Quantum Resident at Google
    X; I joined Physics World as a Student Contributor; I had my first real experience
    with entrepreneurship; I lived with my best friends for three years; and I met
    my partner.

  zh: 我还非常感激许多间接源自攻读物理学博士学位的经历。我在 Google X 担任了博士量子研究员的实习；我加入了《Physics World》成为学生撰稿人；我第一次真正体验了创业；我与最好的朋友们一起生活了三年；我还遇到了我的伴侣。

- en: I’ve entered a new phase of my career, and I love what I’m doing now as well.
    The more time I spend away from physics, the more interested I become in a wider

    the process of learning itself, and the desire for real, tangible impact.
