    flood our feeds almost daily, staying updated and making informed choices becomes
    a daunting task. Today, we direct our focus towards SDXL 1.0, a text to image
    generative model which has undoubtedly garnered considerable interest within the
    field.

    diffusion model that supposedly surpasses its predecessors with a range of promising
    enhancements. In the upcoming chapters, we will closely examine these claims and
    take a closer look at the new enhancements.

    time step **t**, is relatively straightforward. However, the second stage poses
    a challenge, as directly computing the original image is not feasible. To overcome
    this obstacle, we employ a neural network, and this is where the ingenious **U-Net**
    comes into play.

    noised image at time step t and calculate the loss between the predicted and actual
    noise. With a sufficiently large dataset and multiple noise steps, the model gains
    the ability to make educated predictions on noise patterns. This trained U-Net
    model also proves invaluable for generating approximate reconstructions of images
    from given noise.

    process is relatively straightforward. However, there is one more issue worth
    noting. Training millions of noise-added images and rebuilding them would be extremely
    time-consuming and would deplete computing power. To address this challenge, researchers
    have revisited a well-known architecture: **Autoencoders**. As we have already
    utilized a similar approach with U-Net, incorporating transpose convolutions and
    residual blocks, some of these elements will also prove vital role in autoencoders

    space and “**decode**” it back into the original space. Actually that’s why the

    only remaining part is the **conditioning**. Typically, this aspect is achieved
    using **Text Encoders**, though other methods using images as conditioning, such
    as **ControlNet**, exist, though it falls outside the scope of this article. **Text
    conditioning** plays a pivotal role in generating images based on text prompts,
    where the true magic of the Stable Diffusion model lies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    using images with captions and add token embedding vectors as conditioning inputs.
    Employing a **cross-attention** mechanism (queries, keys and values), we can map
    the conditional text embeddings into U-Net residual blocks. Consequently, we can
    incorporate image captions alongside the images themselves during the training
    process and effectively condition image generations based on the provided text.
