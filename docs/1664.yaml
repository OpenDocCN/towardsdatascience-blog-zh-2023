- en: 2023, so far, has been a year that brought phenomenal progress to the field
    of machine learning, with the development and worldwide distribution of advanced
    *Large Language Models* *(LLMs*). However, machine learning proficiency is not
    restricted to fine-tuning *LLLMs* and prompt engineering. A machine learning expert
    knows what happens under the hood, is able to explain/optimize various system
    behaviors, and ultimately is responsible for the overall quality, business-need-fit,
    and performance of the machine learning solution.
