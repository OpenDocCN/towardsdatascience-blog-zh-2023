    must-have skill for every data scientist. While the primary purpose of cross-validation
    is to assess model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters, it offers additional
    outputs that should be noticed. By obtaining and combining predictions for each
    fold, we can generate model predictions for the entire training set, commonly
    known as **out-of-sample or out-of-fold predictions**.

    information about the modelling approach and the dataset itself. By thoroughly
    exploring them, you may uncover answers to questions such as why the model is
    not working as expected, how to enhance feature engineering, and whether there
    are any inherent limitations within the data.

    model exhibits high confidence but makes mistakes. In the post, I will show how
    these predictions help me in three real-world projects.'
