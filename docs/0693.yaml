    from data preparation and model training to owning the entire machine learning
    development cycle. The full cycle includes data ingestion, data cleaning and preparation,
    feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, model deployment, model
    serving, and model maintenance. This wider-encompassing ownership model likely
    requires the data science professional to improve their conceptual understanding
    and applied understanding across the entire development cycle. Perhaps the most
    important moment in this learning journey is understanding that the model training
    is often the easiest step in the process. [Designing Machine Learning Systems
    by Chip Huyen](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/)
    provides an overview of the machine learning development cycle through a conceptual
    lens.

    it to have more longevity in terms of its usefulness. Therefore, it could serve
    as a useful reference for a wide range of tech professionals who might not understand
    each page on day one. That being said, the conceptual side of machine learning…
