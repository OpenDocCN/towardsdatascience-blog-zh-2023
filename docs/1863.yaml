    and demand equilibrium. Someone demands (offers) a good at a certain price, and
    for this demand (offer) to be satisfied (sold), the price or relevance of the
    product should be attractive enough. This over summarised dynamic that you learn
    in any economy introductory course develops into one of the most complex problems
    to solve. As it is quite easy to get lost in the broadness of the issue, we’ll

    Mismanagement can tie up substantial capital, increase carrying costs, and risk
    obsolescence. Conversely, inadequate inventory can potentially lead to missed
    sales opportunities, loss of customer trust and even death (on shortage of medical
    supplies). Striking the optimal balance thus becomes a significant challenge.

    available at the right place and at the right time. However, demand is influenced
    by a multitude of factors including seasonal trends, market shifts, and unforeseen
    events, complicating the task of accurate forecasting. Fortunately, machine learning
    algorithms can be trained on historical sales data, market trends, and other pertinent
    factors to predict future demand. For example, Amazon uses complex demand forecasting
    models to optimise its inventory. They leverage vast amounts of data collected
    from their sales, including historical sales data, special events, holidays, and
    even weather forecasts. For instance, they’ve used machine learning models to
    predict the demand for different products during events like Black Friday, allowing
    them to stock up on high-demand items and avoid stock-outs or overstocking. Furthermore,
    Amazon uses machine learning to optimise its warehouses, positioning products
    based on demand to reduce the time taken to pick items for an order. The good
    news? You don’t have to be Amazon-sized to achieve this. Anyone with a transactional
    database and willingness to invest in cloud services can do the same.

    Using these methods for multistep forecasting would involve predicting one step

    recursive forecasting). This approach, however, can accumulate errors as predictions
    are propagated forward... So even if this is accounted for, the procedure remains
    conceptually flawed and suboptimal. Moreover, as in the case of classic time series

    relevant for forecasting future values. Note that this comes as a solution to

    can provide probabilistic forecasts. This is particularly important in demand
    prediction, where understanding uncertainty can guide decision making. For example,
    knowing the range within which the demand is expected to lie (with a certain probability)
    is very useful in determining stock policies, such as safety stock levels, and
    avoiding stockouts or overstocking. This is done by using a **QuantileLoss** function

    covariates contribute to the forecast. This can be important in business scenarios
    where understanding the reasons behind a prediction is as important as the prediction
    itself. In the example mentioned, we use this to do a manual debugging of the
    model, to check for inconsistencies or “badly” trained models. For instance, we
    found that the special days needed some tuning as the days directly before the
    special days were more relevant that the special days per se (movement from the
    city centers began the day before).'

    they could run simulations to assess the potential impacts of each option. These
    should, at the minimum, consider factors like cost efficiency, delivery speed,
    flexibility, and vulnerability to disruptions. Let’s imagine some scenarios:'

    delay or shutdown. How long could TheRetail maintain operations using their current
    inventory? How would this impact their sales and customer satisfaction?'

    the logistics operator quickly find a replacement? How would this compare to TheRetail’s
    ability to switch suppliers in their current system?'

    risks and benefits associated with each strategy, while allowing for better informed

    — inventory management, supply chain network optimisation, and risk management.
    These issues coexist and interplay, creating a complex landscape. The key to navigating
    this landscape and addressing these challenges lies in the realm of data. Specifically,
    we require **systematic, clean data adhering to a unified taxonomy**. As probably
    more than one angry logistics manager has stated, “The era of managing supply
    chains via excel spreadsheets must end…”

    these challenges. What this implies is that we need to account for a spectrum
    of data sources, encompassing but not restricted to: Historical sales data for
    demand forecasting; Current inventory levels and their locations; Supplier performance
    data; Transportation costs and delivery times; Market trends and customer behaviour
    data; Geopolitical data and news updates for risk assessment; Equipment usage
    data.'

    a robust data infrastructure that can handle large volumes of diverse data types.
    Moreover, partnering with data providers or enhancing internal data collection
    processes can address data scarcity issues.

    this data in a coherent and logical manner. In other words, we need a clear database
    schema, outlining distinct entities and their relationships. Essentially, we need
    to realise End-to-End (E2E) Supply Chain Visibility and consolidate this wealth
    of information into a consistent database — a monumental challenge. However, there
    are individuals brave (or audacious) enough to confront this task and catalyse
    a new era in supply chain management: The era of End-to-End Supply Chain Visibility.
    But what does this concept refer to?'

- en: End-to-End (E2E) supply chain visibility is a transformative concept in the
    industry. It mandates a comprehensive, transparent view of all processes and data
    from the inception to the conclusion of the supply chain. Accomplishing this comprehensive
    visibility involves navigating multiple actors, intricate processes, and vast
    data points. (Dolgui, A., et al., 2022).

    we can exploit advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities. These AI-powered
    technologies interpret and contextualise the vast data generated by supply chain
    activities, offering invaluable insights and enhancing visibility across the entire
    chain. In doing so, they establish the groundwork for complete transparency.

- en: As you can guess, AI not only enables end-to-end transparency but also flourishes
    in such an environment. With transparency in place, and access to all the relevant
    data, models operate more efficiently, delivering more accurate and valuable outputs.
    This synergistic dynamic ultimately fosters a more proactive approach to supply
    chain management. Once this full transparency is achieved, everything we talked
    about in the previous section becomes much easier to make a reality.

    data science technologies in the supply chain industry. By tackling long-standing
    challenges, these technologies promise to shape a future of enhanced efficiency,
    resilience, and responsiveness in supply chains. As we stand on the brink of this
    exciting frontier, we invite you, our readers and fellow pioneers, to continue
    exploring and embracing the convergence of data science and supply chain management.
