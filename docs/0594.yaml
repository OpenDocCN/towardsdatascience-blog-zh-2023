    filled with a variety of unique and beautiful images that encompass us all over
    our surroundings and across the internet. Manipulating these images can lead to
    several intriguing results, which are used for a wide array of fun and helpful
    applications.

- en: In image processing and computer vision, playing around with images is a critical
    component to solving different tasks and acquiring desirable results for numerous
    projects. With the proper handling of imaging tasks, we can recreate a modified
    version of the image useful for several computer vision and deep learning applications,
    such as data augmentation.

    to primarily modify the brightness and contrast of a particular image. Several
    other noteworthy modifications, including shader styles, clip art, emojis, and
    other similar additions, can be implemented and added to your project.
