    have been present on the public consciousness recently. These models, while powerful
    and impressive, are still largely ‚Äú[black boxes](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/8)‚Äù
    ‚Äî there is much about their behavior that we do not understand. This is significant,
    given that these models are increasingly being integrated into all parts of our
    online lives, such as [mental health chatbots](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/chatgpt-ai-experiment-mental-health-tech-app-koko-rcna65110),
    [social media](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription),

    and even the new [Windows 11 update](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688953/new-windows-11-update-puts-bing-chat-front-and-center.html).
    As these models control (or at least, exert influence over) more and more of our
    human decision processes, it is important to know how they would respond in different
    situations. For example, it is not a far-fetched idea that in the future, some
    form of AI (perhaps a variant of ChatGPT) might decide the books and topics we
    see on individual student lesson plans, classroom syllabuses, and library shelves.

    same questions I used GPT-3 to answer in the above sections. It‚Äôs no surprise
    that the two chatbots responded similarly to GPT-3, considering that these large
    language models are all variants of each other. There were some minute differences
    in the outputs ‚Äî Bing Chat‚Äôs reasonings for banning or not recommending a book,
    for example, were more nuanced than the other language models‚Äô. It is interesting
    that all of these large language models, while not recommending certain books
    to certain age groups, did not recommend outright banning books.

    of racism and slavery. Books challenging ‚Äúlongstanding narratives about American

    ‚ÄúWould you recommend a book?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWould you ban a book?‚Äù. One phrase highlights
    a book for different age groups and the other does not allow them to exist at
    all. This difference is evident in GPT-3‚Äôs responses as well: while it did or
    did not recommend certain books to different age groups, it refused (for the most
    part) to recommend *banning* books, for any age level. Perhaps, this is a similar
    approach we can take with the books analyzed in this article as well ‚Äî recommending

    threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials, that leads to
