    to make the games more fun, addictive and often lucrative to the organizer by
    making our chances of winning appear higher than they are. It’s engaging when
    a fan, player or gambler believes they can win. This is most effective if you
    think your chances are better than they actually are.

    the odds of winning. When this tournament is discussed, its commonly thought that
    given even match-ups, a player will win 3 or 4 games on average, and a rough calculation
    will severely overestimate the odds of winning. We’ll do the math and show how
    to use Excel to calculate the odds — adapting the result to other statistical
    software should be straightforward.

    are either played as Best-Of-One (single-game matches) or Best-Of-Three (three-game
    matches). In this article, we discuss the expected outcomes relevant to a Best-Of-One
    (BO1) MTGA event. To earn a token, BO1 games require that a player wins 7 BO1
    matches before incurring 3 losses. Given these parameters:'

    win more games, despite the variability introduced by luck. In the realm of mathematics,
    luck is quantified using probabilistic concepts.

    is expressed as a number ranging from 0 to 1\. A value of 0 indicates the event
    *will not happen* while a value of 1 indicates the event *will happen*. We describe
    a **repeated random process** in mathematical terms using the concept of the random
    variable, which represents the outputs of a repeated random process within a specified
    range. The probability distribution for a random variable is a statistical function
    describing how these outputs are distributed over the random variable.

    a discrete random variable takes *at a given value*. To understand the probability
    that a discrete random variable takes *at or less than a given value*, we use
    the Cumulative Distribution Function or CDF, which is simply the probability that
    a random variable X is less than or equal to x.

    Binomial determine the exact shape of the Negative Binomial distribution. This
    shape is characterized by two (2) parameters, the **stopping parameter, r,** and
    the **success probability, p.** We, therefore, say the negative binomial has an
    (r,p) distribution.

- en: Recall that we aim to model a problem where a player must win 7 BO1 matches
    before incurring 3 losses. In reality, a player can’t win more than 7 times, but
    to model this with the Negative Binomial distribution, we’ll allow 8, 9, 10, ..
    wins. This won’t affect our result because we’ll compute the probability of having
    7 wins *in the event* as the probability of having more than 6 wins *in the model.*

- en: What matters is the number of times the player loses. This is an important distinction
    to make as this determines our **stopping parameter, r.** The attempt is over
    when the player sustains 3 losses. Put another way, we are looking to calculate
    the probability that a player wins *at least* 7 times before incurring 3 losses.
    Because any number of wins greater than 7 would be acceptable, so long as the
    number of losses is less than 3, we would use the cumulative distribution function
    to model this problem.

    < 7) = P(Y <= 6), which is the CDF evaluated at 6\. Then we can calculate the
    probability of winning 7 games as P(Y=7) = 1 — P(Y<7) = 1 — P(Y<=6).'
