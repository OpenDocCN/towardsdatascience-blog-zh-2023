    by my father. My early years were spent playing chess with family, which later
    transitioned to the digital boards of Chess.com. Recently, there’s been a resurgence
    in chess’s popularity, fueled by well-known streamers and the educational efforts
    of Chess Grandmasters. This new wave of interest sparked a question in my mind
    during a series on chess openings: ‘What are the openings I frequently use, and
    how successful are they for me?’ Realizing I had no insight into my own preferences
    or success rates, I decided to marry two of my greatest loves: Chess and Python.'

    Jupyter Notebook using “!” before the syntax.

    request to the API. We’ll use a method called ‘get_player_games_by_month’ to see
    all the games played in a particular year and month. To get a feel for the type
    of data we get, we’ll look at a sample game. By using Python’s built-in ‘pprint’
    library, we can make the JSON response easier to read.

    of our old games on this platform, sorted by the year and month we played them.
    The dates come in link format, so we just need to pick out the date part from
    each link.

    values to the ‘get_player_games_by_month’ method to get more info about our games.
    The following columns will be derived from each game: ‘time_class’, ‘date’, ‘white’,
    ‘black’, ‘game_link’, ‘opening_code’, ‘opening_name’, ‘opening_link’, ‘result’.
    The ‘time_class’ part comes from a different place than the rest, which is all
    inside the PGN section. What we really need for our analysis are the names of
    the players (both White and Black), and the name of the opening move. It’s also
    really useful to have a link for each opening move. This way, we can learn more
    about it and get better at using it. Plus, having the link to the game itself
    is great because it lets us look back and understand how we won or lost each game.'

    easier to see what’s going on. It’s important to know who played the opening move
    in each game. Did I play against that opening when I was Black or did I use it
    when I was White? To figure this out, I’ll check which side I was on for each
    game. Then, by looking at whether I won or lost each game, I can work out my win
    rate for each type of opening.

    using pip if not present) to visualize the data. I created a new variable named
    “opening_and_side”, to be used in visualization, to indicate which side (White
    or Black) played the opening. I only looked at the openings that I played at least
    10 times to make sure my analysis was good.

- en: '**Owen’s Defense!** This was my go-to opening in 2018 and 2019, but I never
    realized I was actually doing well with it until now. It’s not a common opening
    you’d hear streamers talk about, which is great for catching your opponent off
    guard! Turns out, this opening is pretty solid if you look at games played by
    the Grandmasters. Black wins 46.3% of the time, while White has a 34.6% win rate.
    You can see more about it at the Chess Openings Database which can be found here:
    [https://old.chesstempo.com/chess-openings.html](https://old.chesstempo.com/chess-openings.html).'

    Barnes Opening and did not know I had a good winning percentage with it. Even
    the Chess Openings Database says this is not the best opening for Whites, where
    they get -0.4 eval after playing f3, which weakens King’s side. But since it’s
    not a common opening, it seems to surprise my opponents. In this position, Black
    should not take the pawn, but my opponents in most cases took it, and that made
    the game more even.

- en: '**Vant-Kruijs-Opening** — I was always getting into a worse position after
    playing this opening as White, and also gaining an advantage when the opponent
    was playing it, so, bad opening! The Chess Openings Database backs this up: it
    shows that White players only win about 36.5% of the time with this opening, while
    their opponents win 45.3% of the time!'

    easily, falling into traps, but hey, you live and learn! :)

    black, it doesn’t usually put me in a bad spot right away. But, looking back,
    I don’t win as much as I’d like with this opening. It seems like I need to spend
    some time studying and practicing it more.

- en: It’s really cool that Chess.com has this public API for us to do this kind of
    fun analysis and find interesting things. From looking at my games, I found out
    that I actually played better before I started learning about all the famous openings.
    Sometimes, playing an unusual opening can be a good thing. So, why not surprise
    your opponents with the Barnes Opening or Owen’s Defense? Just be careful not
    to make any blunders when your opponent plays the Wayward Queen Attack.
