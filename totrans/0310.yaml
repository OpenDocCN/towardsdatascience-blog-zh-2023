- en: In social enterprises, data is more than numbers on a spreadsheet. Every data
    point represents a life, a story, or an opportunity for positive change. One of
    the most significant examples of data-driven social enterprises are animal welfare
    organisations. Each shelter attempts to collect the data of animals, its volunteers
    and also its day to day operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The existence of inherent data challenges at small-sized, social enterprises
    makes the prudent use of such data a difficult task for shelters. These challenges
    include those around data integration, standardisation and democratised consumption.
    The causes of these challenges are the usual suspects — Lack of dedicated resources
    to do data and a lack of a data-driven culture at the organisation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in the field of animal welfare there are a few organisations that are
    making a conscious attempt to get the ball rolling. One such organisation that
    is redefining how data is managed at animal shelters in the U.S is [Shelter Animals
    Count](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/) (SAC). To those who work in data
    at smaller-sized organisations, you would recognise the challenges SAC faces as
    being silhouettes of your own challenges. In this article, I provide a high-level
    focus on how SAC is evangelising the use of data through action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fundamentally, the data team at SAC recognises the importance of having a **streamlined
    process of data collection**, **building the technology to make it as simple as
    possible and automated for non-technical** shelter employees and providing **self-service
    capability of using analytics to democratise a data culture** within the animal
    welfare system of the U.S. Unsurprisingly, these are also strategies that work
    well for other small-sized organisations (for profit or not-for-profit).

    more often than not operate independently to each other. These shelters often
    use different systems for tracking their animals, have different definitions for
    less common shelter metrics and follow different approaches to protecting and
    rehabilitating animals that find their way into the welfare system.

    analytics capabilities for shelters and other key decision makers. They have established
    a [comprehensive national database in the US dedicated to animal welfare data
    collection](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/leading-national-animal-welfare-organizations-launch-shelter-animals-count/).
    Their mission, is to [foster a data-driven approach to saving animal lives](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/about-the-data/),
    by providing reliable and accessible information.

    they do not advocate the use of data to blame shelters. It is very clear from

- en: Data is produced by a variety of animal shelters. This data is often data relevant
    to their shelter’s day to day and animals that are served. Each shelter records
    these in their own way. Some shelters use [animal shelter software](https://www.softwaresuggest.com/animal-shelter-software)
    while others might collect data via spreadsheets or even pen & paper based methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even of the shelters that use animal shelter software, standardisation is challenging
    as in the U.S alone, there are over 20 different shelter software companies with
    varying features and customisation available for clients. As you can imagine,
    this is definitely one of the many complexities SAC has to deal with on a daily
    basis.

    level data (ALD)**. It’s basically collecting all relevant info of an animal with
    an associated unique ***animal_id***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This push to collect animal level data is an example of SAC using a **streamlined
    process to collect data at the most granular level**. More granular leads to better
    data quality and less chance of skewed figures.

- en: At present, there are two methods by which data is brought in from individual
    animal shelters into SAC’s database. The first is a **push system** where shelters
    can upload their data into the SAC portal after logging in. This upload can be
    through CSV upload or manual entry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second is a **pull system** where [SAC is creating APIs to integrate with
    shelter softwares](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/api-notification/) and
    automatically pull in data from consenting shelters. SAC calls this a “set it
    and forget” system. Arguably, this would be an absolute game changer in the field
    of animal welfare.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pull system or API implementation offers key learnings to other small-sized
    orgs that need to deal with obscure systems. The key is to **make the process
    of data upload as easy as possible** for non-technical users. More importantly,
    the **pull system is automated and that leaves much lesser room for manual error**.

    are created on the portal to arm shelters with insights around their operations,
    [data dashboards](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/data-dashboards/) help see
    overall visualisations of animal welfare across the country and SAC also uses
    the collected data to perform forecasts to better prepare shelters. Tableau is
    the BI tool of choice as of now.

    out a self-service capability** in the future across shelters. Self-service capability
    will help shelters take ownership of their data and create metrics that they can
    base their operations upon.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    while some shelters may record detailed medical histories, others might only note
    basic information like species and intake date.

- en: Ensuring a unique animal ID that remains consistent across various shelter visits
    is a major challenge. An animal adopted and then returned might be recorded as
    two separate entries without a unified ID system, skewing data on shelter intakes
    and outcomes.
