    machines…anything to not have to do this by hand, or pay someone to do this at
    the then going rate of $1.00–2.00 per minute of audio…so a 45-minute interview
    could be as much as $90.00 to transcribe, until about 2017\. In my line of work,
    one hour is just a drop in the bucket of the number of hours of interviews that
    need to be transcribed for a documentary film or audio project. Until recently,
    this has been a line item to consider.

    recall it required some odd login protocols, and then you had to go to the demo,
    click the JSON tab, upload an MP3 file, and then wait for the transcript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Watson didn’t hear accents well; it preferred Midwestern English with correct
    grammar and pronunciation. When I began to work on a project that required transcribing
    a heavy Australian accent, I discovered the transcription results were humourous
    but useless; cleaning up the transcript took as long as it would to transcribe
    it from scratch. Watson also definitely couldn’t detect any languages other than
    English.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I first began with Watson, I found it mildly interesting to consider where
    all these hours of machine learning files would end up, but I didn’t go much further
    than that. As I Google that same question today, I learn that the Watson-transcribed
    interviews that I uploaded may have tangentially helped propel AI in [some video
    games](https://theboolean.io/2021/02/04/how-watson-ibms-artificial-intelligence-is-powering-audio-interactive-vr-ar-environments/).

    to why these transcription tools were getting better; although, I didn’t understand
    what that really meant, nor where it could all go, despite the fact that I had
    already read and basically ascribed to the ideas outlined by Donna Haraway in
    the [Cyborg Manifesto](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/critstudies/sunny.html).

    that otherwise would have taken me hours upon hours with the existing tools of
