    and files without relying on any external tools. This approach gives you complete
    control over the organization and allows you to tailor it to your project needs.

- en: Manual installation may be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, the
    lack of a documented process makes reproducing the exact software environment
    difficult, hindering collaboration and the ability to reproduce results accurately.
    You can use an external data science project management tool to overcome the previous
    issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many tools exist for project management. In this article, we will focus on [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
    Cookiecutter enables you to define project structures based on predefined templates.
    It provides a command-line interface to generate project directories, files, and
    initial code snippets.

    on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories) or other
    community-driven repositories. For example, you can use the template defined by
    the official Cookiecutter repository to organize a data science project [template](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science):'

    manual technique and one based on Cookiecutter. Actually, there is also a third
    technique that almost completely solves the problem of organizing files and folders
    on your computer. It’s about using a **cloud service**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many services of this type, which, in technical terms, are called
    model tracking platforms or experimentation platforms. Examples of these services
    are [Comet](https://www.comet.com/site/), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), and
    [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (which you can install on your computer). These
    services aim to manage all experiments, code, data, and even results in the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model tracking platforms also provide dashboards in which you can compare the
    results of the experiments directly through tables or graphs. The following figure
    shows an example dashboard in Comet.

- en: You start with your local models, which can be stored in a single file. Then
    you save them on the model tracking platform, which, in addition to containing
    a dashboard, also contains a registry for accessing the produced assets. You can
    export the results to a report or integrate them into a deployment flow.

    service could require you to spend money to use it.
