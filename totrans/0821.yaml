    are threatened with extinction. Wildlife conservation efforts rely on accurate
    monitoring of the various species of interest. In [Tuia et al, Nature 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-27980-y),
    the authors list non-invasive data collection devices such as “camera traps, consumer
    cameras, acoustic traps [… and] on-animal devices”.

    For example, a camera trap near a waterhole captures images whenever an animal
    passes by. These images can be classified using computer vision algorithms such
    as convolutional neural networks. You may have encountered the [cat-vs-dog classification
    tutorials](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/beginner-friendly-project-cat-and-dog-classification-using-cnn/),
    which can be adapted to classify any other animal species given enough labeled
    data.

    of aerosols into the atmosphere. Aerosols are light particles that can potentially
    damage the lungs and plants. Their dispersion depends not only on the initial
    concentration of the release, but also on the weather. On hot days without a lot
    of wind, aerosols will stay near the ground for much longer than on days with
    a light breeze.

    in 2022 resulted in the loss of 1,700 human lives, the displacement of more than
    8 million people, and an estimated 15 billion US$ in damages [[source](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2022-disasters-numbers)].

    and land use changes, there is an urgent need to understand the drivers of flood
    damage. The [HOWAS database](https://howas21.gfz-potsdam.de/howas21/?lang=en)
    collects qualitative and quantitative data on flood events, such as the proximity
    of buildings to water, warning lead times, and building characteristics. It is

    a random forest regression algorithm was used to predict total building damage.

- en: Based on my experience as a research data scientist working in the field, I
    see four major challenges in the use of environmental data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data Scarcity**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collecting environmental data can be a menial task. To get the data, you actually
    have to physically go to a location, set up sensors, or collect samples by hand.
    Compared to customer data in an online store, where data simply flows into your
    database over the internet, the cost of obtaining a single sample is much higher.
    The inaccessibility of some regions can make it difficult to collect data with
    sufficient spatial and temporal resolution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, environmental datasets consist of a few hundred samples that have been
    obtained at great expense. Data analysis and algorithms must be carefully selected
    and adapted as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Specialized data formats**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For historic reasons or for convenience, environmental data often comes in formats
    that are not easily recognizable by machine learning algorithms and data science
    pipelines. From my experience in training environmental data scientists, the trainees
    are therefore often struggling to translate the concepts from standard machine
    learning tutorials to environmental data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many machine learning routines rely on data that is shaped like the standard
    warehouse data, is accessible as csv or json files, or comes in standard image
    formats. Environmental data is often collected by a small number of people and
    the collection protocols do not consider data scientific downstream applications.
    Hence, data engineering and cleaning is often a major task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Data quality**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even when data is available in sufficient quantity, the data quality may fluctuate
    significantly. For example, photographic observations of the environment depend
    on daylight and camera angle, and images can look very different from shot to
    shot. Sensors can fail and degrade in quality, and qualitative databases like
    HOWAS are expensive to maintain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Domain Knowledge**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Domain knowledge is crucial for processing environmental data, understanding
    the layout, and asking the right questions. Labeling environmental data often
    requires a substantial amount of expertise. Therefore, interdiscplinary projects
    are the norm, where data scientists and machine learning specialists work closely
    with domain experts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the challenges associated with working with environmental data, I believe
    that environmental data science has great potential. Sustainability is a major
    focus point of today’s political and non-governmental discussions, and good data
    can help make informed decisions. Businesses are developing strategies based on
    real-time data, and it would be great to see a similar impact of data in sustainability
    discussions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aspiring environmental data scientists may find working in the sustainability
    sector to be fruitful and rewarding. In projects related to the protection of
    natural resources, monitoring of the environment, and implementation of sustainability
    policies, they find more purpose than in developing the millionth algorithm for
    online marketing or cryptocurrency prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hope that in the future environmental data science will become an established
    area of data science and machine learning. Educating engineers and scientists
    who can work at the intersection of environmental studies and programming is a
    first step towards increasing the maturity of the field. As high-quality data
    becomes more available and interest in sustainability grows, I am confident that
    environmental data science will be important in the future.

    three examples that illustrate the diversity of the field. There are unique challenges
    to working with environmental data, mainly related to data scarcity and data quality.

    advantage of the unanalyzed environmental data. I hope that in the future, environmental
    data science will reach a stage of maturity where environmental data directly
    informs decisions and improves sustainability.
