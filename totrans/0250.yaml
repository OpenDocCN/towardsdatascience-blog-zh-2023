    a unique opportunity for you to learn how others view you while also gaining insights
    into yourself. Most laws are similar to the European Union’s [General Data Protection
    Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504),
    commonly know as “GDPR”. It includes provisions requiring organizations to tell
    you the type of personal data they store about you, why they are storing it, how
    they are using it, and the length of time they store it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the laws also include an often overlooked requirement commonly known as
    **data portability**. Data portability requires organizations to give you a machine-readable
    copy of the data they are currently storing about you upon request. In the GDPR,
    this right is defined in Article 15, *“Right of access by the data subject”*.
    The data that organizations have often includes a rich and varied set of features
    and is clean, making it ripe for several data analysis, modelling, and visualization
    tasks.

    at predicting future values of exercise minutes. Needless to say, hyperparameter
    tuning would help improve these results.

    data. For one thing, 10,083 of the 22,313 song plays in my file had no genre assigned
    to them. Also, there appears to be a lot of overlap in the genres assigned. For
    example, “R&B/Soul”, “Soul and R&B”, “Soul”, and “R&B / Soul” are all genres assigned
    to different songs in my data. The totals in the chart above would certainly be
    different if I recast the genres of all songs to use a consistent genre naming
    scheme.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than invest the time to update the genres, I decided on another test
    to determine if the trends in the chart truly represent my playing patterns. Since
    Apple includes song play ending reasons in the data, I looked to see if I tend
    to skip past rock songs more frequently than other genres, indicating that I try
    to play other genres when too many rock songs are being played.
