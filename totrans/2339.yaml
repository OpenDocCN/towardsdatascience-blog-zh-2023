    so the report focuses on research from a recent paper by Luccioni et al., 2022²
    which records the energy requirements of a number of large language models (LLMs)
    including ChatGPT.

    OpenAI’s GPT-3 comes top with a consumption of over 1200 Megawatt-hours. That’s
    about as much electricity as 120 US homes would consume in a year according to
    consumption figures by the U.S. Energy Information Administration³. That certainly
    seems like a lot of energy.

    and the work is mostly concerned with BLOOM, her company’s alternative to ChatGPT.
    The figures for other models are approximate and based on what public information
    is available ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure)
    reports Lucciana saying that nothing is really known about ChatGPT and that it
    could just be “…three raccoons in a trench coat.” — does that mean GPT-4 will
    be four raccoons?).

    and their CO2 emissions (see chart, below). It finds for example, that the CO2
    emissions generated in training ChatGPT are equivalent to one passenger taking
    a flight from New York to San Francisco around 500 times! Or the total energy
    consumption of a single American over 28 years!

- en: According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure),
    while AI models are getting larger (and presumably more energy intensive), the
    companies creating them are working on improving efficiency. Microsoft, Google
    and Amazon — the cloud companies that host much of the work — all are aiming for
    carbon-negative or carbon-neutral operations. This is, of course, highly desirable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, while training AI systems is energy-intensive, recent research shows that
    AI systems can also be used to optimize energy consumption. A paper from DeepMind⁴
    released in 2022 details the results of a 2021 experiment in which it trained
    an AI called BCOOLER to optimize cooling in Google’s data centres.

    After three months, a, roughly, 12.7% energy saving was achieved.

    of these centres will also make them cheaper to run. Maybe we should be thinking
    about applying AI to other energy-intensive industries, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I doubt that we are currently in a position to know exactly what the eventual
    toll on the environment will be. LLMs like ChatGPT are not going away and so the
    energy that needs to be spent in training them is definitely going to be spent.
    On the other hand, it’s not the case that people are going to stop flying NY to
    SF, heating their homes or using their cars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we should try and put some of this somewhat shocking data into perspective.
    While a ChatGPT training session might use as much energy as one American does
    in 28 years (which sounds an awful lot), it is also true that 330 million Americans,
    the population of the USA, emit around **10 million times more CO2** than a single
    ChatGPT session⁵.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there appear to be around 20 flights a day from New York to San Francisco,
    and say that each flight serves 150 passengers; that works out to be over 1 million
    tonnes of CO2 emissions per year — **more than 2000 ChatGPTs⁵**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For single entities, ChatGPT, and its like, clearly use a lot of energy (and
    thus — at the moment, at least — produce a lot of CO2 emissions) but compared
    to energy consumption and CO2 emissions from other human activity, are they really
    very significant (there are, after all, a lot more humans than LLMs)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, it’s got to be good news that the large cloud hosting companies are aiming
    to achieve carbon neutrality which, if achieved, will reduce CO2 emissions to
    zero. So while energy use might remain high, the aim is to make its environmental
    impact neutral.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, AI can be used to mitigate some of the energy use in data centres.
    Maybe similar technology could be used in airlines and other energy-intensive
    industries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bottom line, however, is that we are all producing more CO2 than we should,
    so any additional energy use, that is not produced from renewables, is moving
    in the wrong direction.
