- en: As a business performance analyst, I constantly report monthly revenue performance
    and track business cycle trends. To deal with the problem of seasonal changes,
    I rely on year-over-year comparisons. The problem is that these comparisons rely
    on 12-month-old data, which means that you will catch up with the trend late,
    which could have devastating consequences. Economists and statisticians have a
    more sophisticated way of dealing with seasonal fluctuation and catching changes
    in the business cycle soon after they occur.
