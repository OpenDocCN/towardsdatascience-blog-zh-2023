    of modern artificial intelligence. In this blog post, we will provide a concise
    version of the story of the perceptron, from its neural network origins to its
    evolution into the multilayer perceptron and beyond. We will explore the basic
    mathematics that powers this model, allowing it to function as a binary classifier,

- en: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts' work on artificial neurons in 1943 [1] inspired
    a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt to make the perceptron model in 1957 [2].
    Rosenblatt's perceptron was the first neural network (NN) to be described with
    an algorithm, paving the way for modern techniques for machine learning (ML).
    Upon its discovery, the perceptron got much attention from scientists and the
    general public. Some saw this new technology as essential for intelligent machines—a
    model for learning and changing [3].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the perceptron’s popularity did not persist. Then, in 1969, Marvin
    Minsky and Seymour Papert published their book, “Perceptrons,” which highlighted
    the limitations of the perceptron model while revealing that it could not solve
    problems like the XOR classification [4] (Section 3). This work triggered a significant
    loss of interest in NNs, turning their attention to other methods. The early years
    of the perceptron are listed in **Fig. 1**.

    if a dataset can be separated linearly, the perceptron learning algorithm will
    find a solution in a finite number of steps [8]. The theorem says that, given
    enough time, the perceptron model will find the best weights and biases to classify
    all data points in a linearly separable dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if the dataset isn't linearly separable, the perceptron learning algorithm
    might not find a suitable solution or converge. Because of this, researchers have
    developed more complex algorithms, like multilayer perceptrons and support vector
    machines, that can deal with data that doesn't separate in a straight line [9].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As previously mentioned, the perceptron model is a linear classifier. It makes
    a decision boundary, a feature-space line separating the two classes [6]. When
    a new data point is added, the perceptron model sorts it based on where it falls
    on the decision boundary. The perceptron is fast and easy to use because it is
    simple but can only solve problems with data that can be separated linearly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3.2\. Limitations of the Perceptron Model
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One big problem with the perceptron model is that it can't deal with data that
    doesn't separate in a straight line. The XOR problem is an example of how some
    datasets are impossible to divide by a single hyperplane, which prevents the perceptron
    from finding a solution [4]. Researchers have developed more advanced methods
    to get around this problem, such as multilayer perceptrons, which have more than
    one layer of neurons and can learn to make decisions that don't follow a straight
    line [5].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The perceptron model is also sensitive to setting the learning rate and initial
    weights. For example, if the learning rate is too low, convergence might be slow,
    whereas a large learning rate may cause oscillations or divergence. In the same
    way, the choice of initial weights can affect how fast the solution converges
    and how it turns out [10].

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though the basic perceptron model is made for two-class problems, it can
    solve problems with more than two classes by training multiple perceptron classifiers,
    one for each category [11]. The most common approach is one-vs.-all (OvA), in
    which a separate perceptron is trained to distinguish classes. Then, when classifying
    a new data point, the perceptron with the highest output is chosen as the predicted
    class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another approach is the one-versus-one (OvO) method, in which a perceptron is
    trained for each pair of classes. The final classification decision is made using
    a voting scheme, where each perceptron casts a vote for its predicted class, and
    the type with the most votes is selected. While OvO requires training more classifiers
    than OvA, each perceptron only needs to handle a smaller subset of the data, which
    can benefit large datasets or problems with high computational complexity.

    using perceptrons. For example, let’s consider the expansion of two binary digits
    (i.e., `A` and `B`), which can be represented as a simple AND gate. As demonstrated
    in Section 4, an AND gate can be modeled using a perceptron.

    more than two bits, we need to add more parts, like half and full adders, which
    require a combination of logic gates [14]. Using perceptrons to build these parts
    makes making an artificial neural network that can perform binary multiplications
    possible.

    their hardware implementation is less efficient than traditional transistors.
    However, recent improvements in neuromorphic computing have shown that it might
    be possible to make hardware that acts like neural networks, like perceptrons

    a decision boundary (a hyperplane) that separates the classes in the feature space

    function, while logistic regression uses the logistic (sigmoid) function [10].

    dataset. Logistic regression is more reliable and can deal with a broader range
    of problems because it is based on probabilities and can model non-linear decision
    boundaries. However, the perceptron model may be easier to use and use less computing
    power in some situations, especially when dealing with data that can be separated

    parts of audio signals, such as spectral or temporal features, and putting them
    together. Even though more advanced methods like deep learning and convolutional
    neural networks often give better results, the perceptron model can work well,
    especially when only a few genres or features can be separated linearly.

    length to determine if the activity is regular or malicious [21]. Support vector

    task determining the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) expressed
    in text. By turning text into numerical feature vectors like term frequency-inverse
    document frequency (TF-IDF) representations [22], a perceptron model can be taught
    to classify text based on its tone. More advanced techniques like recurrent neural
    networks or transformers have since surpassed perceptrons in sentiment analysis
    performance. However, perceptrons can still be an introduction to text classification
    or a simpler alternative for specific use cases.

    but it needs help with tasks that need clear decision lines. The introduction
    of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), consisting of multiple layers of perceptron-like
    units, marked a significant advancement in artificial neural networks [5]. MLPs
    can approximate any continuous function, given a sufficient number of hidden layers
    and neurons [23]. By employing the backpropagation algorithm, MLPs can be trained
    to solve more complex tasks, such as the XOR problem, which is not solvable by
    a single perceptron.

    learning focused on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).
    The perceptron model was the basis for deep learning techniques like convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have reached
    state-of-the-art performance in tasks like image classification, natural language
    processing, and speech recognition [24].

    is carried over to the convolutional layers. To learn about spatial hierarchies
    in the data, these layers apply filters to the input regions near them. In the
    same way, RNNs build on the perceptron model by adding recurrent connections.
    This lets the network learn temporal dependencies in sequential data [25].
