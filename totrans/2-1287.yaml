    a significant milestone in my career development. Reflecting on my journey, including
    all the achievements and struggles along the way, I can see my growth from being
    a junior new grad to a senior who leads multiple project deliverables. Last year,
    I published an article about [the seven principles I follow to be a better data
    scientist](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/seven-principals-i-follow-to-be-a-better-data-scientist-25a547d6acfc)
    and got a lot of positive feedback. In this article, I want to share more learnings
    about data scientists' career development that have helped me get promoted. Hopefully,
    my insights will be beneficial to accelerate your career growth, especially if
    you are new to the industry.

    management or energy management. I have tried several suggestions over the years.
    In the work setting, the most practical and useful one for me is blocking time
    for **deep working hours.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I define deep work as researching methods to solve problems, coding to establish
    pipelines, studying model results and making improvements, etc. These types of
    work are difficult but crucial for the final deliverables. When I work on these,
    I don’t want to be interrupted by meetings, emails, or messages. Thus, I dedicate
    the unlikely-to-be-interrupted times for these tasks. In my case, it usually would
    be the afternoons. Blocking deep working hours ensures consistent, high-quality
    output while maintaining necessary communications.

    the same EDA and modeling process for different projects; maybe you need to make
    the same presentation every month with updated results; maybe you need to teach
    the same thing to different people, etc. When you face these tasks, modularize
    them like how you would build classes and functions while coding. You can build
    a standard processing pipeline for data analysis or write certain functions to
    calculate metrics. You can save certain templates for specific documents and presentations
    and record good practices through documentation or videos to ramp up others more
    smoothly. Even though the initial setup will take longer, it will save you a lot
    of time and energy in the future.

    No one is an isolated island working on projects solving ambiguous business problems.
    Everyone is good at something, so you don’t have to be an expert in everything.
    Take the chance to deep dive and improve your core skills. In addition, collaboration
    also challenges me to think further and deeper while brainstorming ideas and working
    on projects collectively. Collaboration with delegation is the path toward senior
    roles as we are learning how to tackle more complicated problems with more efficiency.

    with others, in fact, leveraging others to help you grow. Companies provide resources
    for us to onboard and improve our skills. Do not waste it. Look for mentors, sponsors,

    you are overpromising what you can deliver to impress people at work, you are
    either facing the risk of burnout or the disappointments and consequences of being
    unable to finish on time. Besides not overpromising, another useful trick is to
    constantly align priorities. Find out the focus of this quarter, this month, this
    week, and this day. Things do change, that’s why we need to constantly align priorities
    within the team so we focus on the most important tasks all the time.

    Unfortunately, we are human beings with different skills and preferred working
    styles. Frictions are common. They come from different opinions, mindsets, backgrounds,
    focuses, etc. In a working environment, we need to solve problems, not people
    or emotions. You should know what you prefer so you can communicate and set up
    boundaries. In the meantime, keep an open mind with different perspectives and
    working styles. Learn when to cooperate and when to compromise. Remember, whenever
    disagreements come, land on action points focus on moving forward by solving problems,
    not people, not emotions.

    grow and become self-sufficient. When I first started ramp-up juniors, I doubted
    whether this was worth it since it takes longer to teach someone about something
    than just finishing the tasks by yourself. However, it is important to consider
    the long-term benefits of a team's development, as well as to manage time and
    energy sustainably for yourself. When I realized this, it was the first moment

    to communicate your desire for promotion to your manager and skip manager at the
    appropriate times. Prepare evidence to support your promotion case and request
    feedback on additional requirements for the next grade level during communications.
    Keeping your head down to get the work done is not enough anymore. Clear and effective
    communication of expectations and feedback is crucial for workforce growth, even
    though it might not be easy for everyone. I always go through extensive preparation
    and rehearsals before communicating, and I may still feel unnatural next time.
    However, asking for recognition is an important step in being responsible for
    yourself. You have to be more proactive in your own career development than anyone.

- en: Last but not least, it is important to celebrate when you get promoted. However,
    it's equally important to not doubt yourself or be too hard on yourself if you
    don't. Although it may sound very political, getting promoted actually depends
    on a lot of factors. Even though I share a lot of advice here, I am very cautious
    about not taking too much credit from **luck**. Getting promoted depends largely
    on how your company is doing and how your team is doing, which is largely out
    of your control. Constantly communicate your expectations, do your best at work,
    and focus on what you can control while leaving the rest to fate. If you don’t
    think your efforts are recognized and appreciated enough, finding a place that
    values you more is always better than believing you are not worth it.
