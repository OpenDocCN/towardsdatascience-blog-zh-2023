    have been quite busy each November — thanks to a fun challenge called the [#30DayMapChallange](https://30daymapchallenge.com).
    Each year, this challenge has a thematic schedule, proposing a topic that should
    be the primary directive for map visualisation to be posted on that particular
    day. While the pre-defined daily topics certainly mean a constraint for the creative
    mind, they also help participants to find mutual interest, share data sources,
    and express individual styles visually and technologically.

    and showing the different maps I created — usually in Python.

- en: To kick off the second week, I built on the dataset of [African rivers](https://lnkd.in/dZ6rZeGG
    https://lnkd.in/dUZFPdBN) published by the United Nations FAO. Their GIS file
    contains almost 200k line polygons belonging to rivers attributed with a couple
    of parameters, such as their major river basin or the Strahler stream order of
    each arc. I used the letter to set both the colour and width of each river; the
    higher the rank, the darker and thinner the river, going form first-order streams
    to 8th order primary trunks.

- en: This one is a bit convoluted but is based on Uber’s [H3 hexagons](https://www.uber.com/en-HU/blog/h3/).
    First, I collected data from the [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species geospatial
    database](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download) covering
    the [habitat](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/exploring-a-global-wildlife-gis-database-0453723ae5c9)
    of all the (about 5k) mammalian species habitats in Polygon formats. Then, I computed
    the spatial overlap of each species’ habitat by doing pairwise comparisons. Due
    to the complexity of the polygons, this would have taken forever if using simple
    GeoPandas overlays, so instead, I split each of the habitats into hexagons and
    simply captured the overlay of habitats as the number of shared hexagon IDs.This
    way, I managed to define the network nodes as species and their network connection
    as the Jaccard similarity index of their sets of hexagon IDs (the relative ratio
    of their shared habitats), which, then, I could use to visualise them using Gephi.

- en: Finally, network nodes are sized based on their degree centrality — the number
    of other species they share their habitats with. Besides, the colours of each
    node — again, species — are coloured based on the primary colour of its largest
    habitat country, giving this network graph a final touch as an actual world map.

    data set, visualising 49,183 road segments and showing very neatly how the continent’s
    morphology and population density changes, with very sparse roads up north and
    neet grid structures in the more populated areas.

    so long ago, published by Towards Data Science, on the accessibility of publicly
    available defibrillator devices in Budapest and Vienna. The colour of each intersection
    encodes reachability time, from green to red, showing how much time does it takes
    to reach the nearest device on foot at a running pace, ranging from 0 minutes
    (green) to 10 minutes (red), capturing most critical areas by red patches.

- en: For day 12, I built my map using OpenStreetMap ([OSMNx](http://osmnx.readthedocs.io))
    and Wikipedia data. In particular, I collected the so-called [Economic Complexity
    Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Complexity_Index), which is a macro-economical
    indicator capturing the productive capabilities of a country. Using network theory,
    this metric is derived from countries’ international trading profiles and import
    and export patterns and measures the country’s economic stability and potential.
    As a measure quantifying entire countries in a simplified way, also allowing one
    to compare and rank countries, it has a long list of supporters and critics, but
    let’s leave that for another time. As for the map, as usual, I built it in Python,
    using OSMNx, Matplotlib, urrlib, and to get a nice final touch with a dark-mode
    base map, contextily.

- en: With this map and the corresponding article, I posed and tackled a popular and
    crucial urban development question — green equality and accessibility of green
    areas. I explore these concepts using governmental open data about Vienna in this
    piece by computing the average area of green space per capita in the different
    neighbourhoods of Vienna and then relating it to the local financial situation.

    modelled grid data published by WorldPop. As I wrote in the original [article](/exploring-large-scale-raster-population-data-72803cf7f2ad),
    where I show a tutorial on how to create maps like this, I have often seen beautiful
    population maps circulating online; however, I usually got stuck at some technical
    parts, like visualising other map segments than shown in the tutorial or turning
    the large-scale raster data into more computation-friendly vector formats. I overcome
    some of these shortcomings in this article with a hands-on guide to two primary
    global population data sources. Read the full tutorial [here](/exploring-large-scale-raster-population-data-72803cf7f2ad).
