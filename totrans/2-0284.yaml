    scraping against the track to shield the car’s essential components from potential
    damage when contacting curbs. Importantly, its impact on performance is minimal.

    Their primary aim is to provide a clear and concise visual representation of data
    trends without consuming much space. Sparklines can effectively illustrate stock
    price trends, weather patterns, sales data, and more. I also use them as a navigational
    tool; users can click on a sparkline to access the full-sized chart if they spot
    something intriguing.⁸

    I used again ChatGPT with Noteable plugin on. This time, I have done that on a
    website opened on an Android device. I generated random sample data for the charts
    and the code for the chart themselves (code below).

    line, and pie charts. There are many other, more advanced options worth considering
    for producing insightful and engaging visualizations. A byproduct to this was
    the review and “field-test” of various free tools, that one could use to produce

    examples of intricate charts such as Sankey diagrams, waterfall charts, radar
    charts, dumbbell plots, gauges, sparklines, and bullet charts. I used various
    tools to craft these visualizations, including Google Charts, Noteable, Python,
    and Plotly.

    and enable you to weave a more compelling narrative with data. **Regardless of
    I succeeded or not, I encourage you to experiment with these alternative chart
    types to get an understanding of their characteristics, testing various applications,
    and further enhance your data-driven storytelling arsenal.**
