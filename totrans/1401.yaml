    Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool. The book challenges the common myth that expertise
    comes from natural talent. Rather, with ample examples in different domains, it
    proves top performances can be achieved, and skills can be learned through such
    a technique called “**Deliberate Practice**.” In the book, the author provides
    examples of various skills, such as excelling in musical performances, wartime
    aircraft battles, and strategy games like chess and Go. Reading this book brings
    me a deja vu as I reflected on my own journey of learning data science skills
    fast towards mastering.'

    which is essentially doing something repeatedly and hoping the repetition itself
    will do the job. For example, play the same song every day with a guitar to be
    a guitar guru, or run the same trail every day at the same speed to prepare for
    a marathon. Indeed, repetition brings familiarity. You might become an expert
    in playing one song and lose some weight through the daily run. However, expertise
    in one song or trail won’t make you a top guitar performer or runner. No doubt
    we have hobbies and just want to do something for fun rather than for competition
    or make a living out of it, but for the skills you do desire to get better and
    eventually become a top performer, deliberate practice is a better way to achieve
    your goals. Deliberate practice is being purposeful, thoughtful, and focused during
    practice. Specifically, it has the following characteristics:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deliberate practice has **well-defined, specific goals** for each stage. For
    example, if your goal is to be a top runner in a marathon, you need to have specific
    goals in how fast you should finish a marathon and make plans to train towards
    reaching it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deliberate practice is **focused**. During practice, you must be aware of what
    you do with full attention, not in auto-pilot mode. If you find yourself distracted
    while completing a task, you are likely not taking the goal seriously, or the
    tasks are too easy to fulfill. Working on easy tasks will not help you grow your
    skills.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deliberate practice involves **feedback**. You have to be evaluated constantly
    for your performance to find areas of improvement. In most cases, you must follow
    mentors who will provide instant feedback at your practice. A mentor doesn’t necessarily
    have to be a person. It can also be a well-designed tutorial when finding a mentor
    is impossible. As an illustration, the book explains how skilled writers enhance
    their writing abilities by contrasting their articles with the publications in
    which they aspire to feature their work. In addition, it is important to switch
    mentors as you continue to enhance your skills. For instance, after a writer’s
    article was accepted by a desired publication, they altered their approach to
    practice when they set goals to improve vocabulary, conciseness, logical structure,
    etc.

    your goal is to maintain your current skill level, if you want to get better from
    every practice, you should make yourself feel a bit “uncomfortable” during practice.
    Always challenge yourself to run faster, perform better, write that piece of code
    cleaner, and execute faster. Stepping outside your comfort zone extends your frontiers
    and opens up opportunities.

    above, the field has to have clearly defined and measurable criteria for what
    makes a top performer in this skill.

    have reached their levels through deliberate practice. In this blog post, I would

    want to do with the skills will guide you on what to learn and how to learn. If
    you are a student, you may learn something to pass an exam; If you are at work,
    you may learn something to equip yourself for a project you are working on or
    stay cutting-edge for the latest technology in your industry. We need both short-term
    goals and long-term goals. Anyone familiar with time management would know** [**Eisenhower’s
    Urgent/Important Principle**](https://www.mindtools.com/al1e0k5/eisenhowers-urgentimportant-principle)
    **concept. We are categorizing tasks according to their level of urgency and importance.
    Although many prioritize urgent and important tasks, it''s important not to neglect
    important but non-urgent tasks that set us apart in the long term. For instance,
    learning and mastering a new skill. Short-term goals are like these urgent and
    important tasks, which give us efficiency, but long-term goals motivate us to
    grow continuously and consistently, which is especially valuable in the ever-changing

    Instead of mindlessly consuming tutorials and resources, I structured my learning
    sessions. I dedicated focused blocks of time daily while taking online courses
    at Coursera. For these online classes, it is very easy to think you understand
    something because you watched the videos or read the articles. What I forced myself
    to do was to work on the projects to get my hands dirty. At first, I would spend
    hours googling different syntaxes and try them out on a DataFrame to illustrate
    their usage. A simple visualization would take me a long time. However, you can’t
    learn a programming language simply by copying and pasting. We need to know what
    it is used for and why you use this one over the others for specific tasks. Getting
    my hands dirty on projects helped me stay focused and absorb information deeply.

    it may seem obvious, don''t assume that you''re automatically staying focused.
    Staying focused requires more energy than simply going through the motions. It''s
    similar to running - maintaining a certain heart rate while running a mile requires
    more energy than just running mindlessly. During practice, try to do more thinking
    and question yourself more often. Ask yourself if you truly understand what you''re
    doing and why you''re doing it.**'

    virtually, I received feedback regularly on my lecture questions, homework assignments,
    and projects. In addition, my small group of classmates with diverse backgrounds
    provided feedback to each other. We learned from one another's expertise and mistakes.
    Their insights and critiques helped me refine my technical skills and inspired
    me to approach problems strategically and creatively. Although when taking online
    tutorials, I received grades for completing online assignments, I struggled without
    guidance and immediate feedback. Constructive feedback transformed my errors into
    opportunities for growth and accelerated my learning curve. Thanks to this intensive
    8-week bootcamp, I grew exponentially.

    own, but also to seek guidance and feedback from experienced individuals. This
    is the quickest and most effective way to improve your skills. When learning something
    new, consider finding a mentor who is much more sophisticated than you so can
    receive immediate feedback on your performance during practice. If you can’t find
    a mentor, it is also useful to have practice partners, or join a community.**'

    be achieved by stepping beyond its boundaries. For me, learning data science was
    a journey outside of my comfort zone. In the field of Economics, Stata is a familiar
    software used alongside R by faculties and students for data analysis and modeling.
    However, with the increasing popularity of big data, I recognized the need to
    learn Python to improve my productivity. To truly master data science, I challenged
    myself with projects that seemed difficult at first. This allowed me to navigate
    through challenges and improve my problem-solving skills. Data science is changing
    so fast. What was new and cutting-edge last year can easily be replaced and become
    legacies. We can never be complacent in this field. Stepping out of my comfort
    zone not only expand my skill sets, but also equip me with the courage to accept
    challenges and confidence that I can eventually solve the problems I am facing.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Advice: Each trial outside your comfort zone expanded your skill sets and
    boosted your confidence. Don’t be afraid of facing challenges during practice.
    Challenge yourself to work on more complicated projects, write cleaner code, and
    build even higher accurate or more explainable models. It is the most painful
    but also the most rewarding part of growing. Walking uphills is always more tiring
    than walking on the Plain in circles. You can always lie to yourself that walking
    in circles is also practice, but it will not lead you to the rewarding scenery
    on the top of a mountain.**'

    development. It involves setting specific goals, maintaining focused practice
    sessions, actively seeking and incorporating feedback from mentors, and challenging
    oneself by stepping beyond the comfort zone. This method of practice transforms
    learning from a passive process into a proactive journey of growth and mastery.
    In this post, I share my experience of learning data science skills to further
    prove the importance of deliberate practice, hoping to inspire anyone who is interested
    in mastering any new skills.
