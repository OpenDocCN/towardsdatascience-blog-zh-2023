  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Talking to counterparts at other companies and to colleagues not being part
    of a data team, I actually discovered that many stakeholders rely on some sort
    of data documentation and hope to find somewhere **a place where all the company’s
    data-related knowledge would be available**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    made accessible to the right persons at the right place. Just imagine how that
    would feel!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data strategist at my current employer one of my priorities is to **make
    data available to all departments**. This means communicating about the work achieved
    by the data team at the company but also allowing every one of my colleagues (and
    possibly external stakeholders) to know what data assets we own as an organization.

    and reliable data documentation for yourself and your stakeholders.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is data documentation?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**It is a set of relevant information about a company’s data assets.** It encompasses
    a range of elements such as metrics definitions, descriptions of data sources,
    data schemas, explanations about data models, a mapping of access rights to data
    tools, etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no universal template to create data documentation. What matters most
    is that data documentation serves your organization. Think of it as **a comprehensive
    manual that empowers stakeholders to navigate the data landscape with confidence
    and clarity**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is data documentation essential?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for any type of documentation data documentation gives your company a kind
    of memory about past events. A written documentation does not only tell the current
    state of things. It also allows any member to grasp the history of data management,
    no matter how long they have been with the organization. **By writing down the
    set of definitions, rules and processes that were put in place over time, you
    bring clarity and context to anyone** interested in using data at your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As for the present, establishing and maintaining data documentation up-to-date
    allows to set in stone what has been decided at a conceptual level and what has
    been implemented on the technical side. Gathering all these elements at a central
    documentation place definitely brings stakeholders together: after they agreed
    on something about data management, **writing it down adds value to its reliability**.'

- en: So, where should you start?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we will see later on, the format of your data documentation may vary depending
    on your target audience. At first don’t focus on the form your documentation will
    take but rather on its intent. You will then **derive your documentation’s content
    — and its form — from the intention behind building data documentation**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You can start by asking yourself the following questions:'
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally speaking I identify three types of audience you should address data
    documentation to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The first audience is the one closest to your position as a data leader: it
    is **your data team**. Within this possibly heterogeneous group we can distinguish
    between **newcomers** and junior hires, and more **senior members** of your team.
    Thus your documentation should include a presentation of both basic concepts and
    more advanced elements like the detailed calculation method of metrics.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In second position come **business users**. First you want to serve the users
    who **use data on a daily basis**. Their needs may slightly vary from the needs
    of another group: the business users who may **have a data-related question from
    time to time** and who do not work closely with you. Your documentation should
    be made accessible to these two types of business users.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally **other stakeholders** may require a specific documentation related
    to your company’s data assets. In this category I include the **board of management,
    colleagues from other departments** who you do not necessarily interact with,
    as well as **external stakeholders**. Their needs for a data documentation may
    be smaller but they need to be concise and accurate.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for the form you should **adapt to the tools used by your target audience**.
    Do they centralize their knowledge base in a tool like Notion or Confluence? Then
    this is where your data documentation should be placed. Do they rather use slide
    decks shared on a Google Drive or Sharepoint server? Then this is where you should
    present them the elements of data documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to adapting the form and location of your documentation to your
    audience’s habits, you can also include some elements of information about your
    data **directly in your data tools** (e.g. in your data warehouse or data transformation
    tool). Recent tools like data catalogs and softwares to support (meta)data management
    help you achieve just that.
