    on this topic, respondents working in DS reported spending anywhere between 10–60%
    of their time making slide decks or giving presentations. I realise that’s not
    a very robust statistic, but regardless of the true distribution, the sentiment
    chimes true for many of us working in Data Science: we use PowerPoint – A LOT
    – to showcase everything from model cards to screenshots of ROC curves and Shapley
    values.'

    background or know how to code.'

    unexpected behaviours). It’s a speedier alternative to batch testing and – crucially
    – it democratizes the testing process. Using Gradio, you don’t need to rely on
    a lone Data Scientist to run batch tests in a notebook – you can just host your
    model publicly (e.g. on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-gradio)),
    share the link to the model, and everyone in your team can get involved and have
    a go at probing the model.'

    replacement. Besides, if PowerPoint is used *well*, it can actually be an incredibly
    effective way to showcase parts of the ML lifecycle like model cards and business
    cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BUT for other parts of the ML lifecycle (like showcasing feature importances
    and model results), PowerPoint doesn’t always work very well, and you might find
    that Gradio helps address some of its weaknesses and stops your audience from
    falling asleep during presentations.

    or ineffective, why not give Gradio a go? It’s certainly been a big help for me.
