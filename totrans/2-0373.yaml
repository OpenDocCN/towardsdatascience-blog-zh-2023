    should be expanded upon. So, you might want to experiment with more hands-on exploration
    of the data and hypothesis testing. Maybe, choose one or two questions you want
    to answer with data and descriptive statistics and start analyzing it.

    etc.

    were made. Also if you don’t understand something, just ask ChatGPT right there
    to expand on what it did.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. More advanced practitioners should also focus more heavily on the data engineering
    and the pipelines for productionizing code. These are things that you still need
    to be fairly hands-on with. I found that ChatGPT was able to get me part of the
    way there, but I needed to do a lot of debugging myself.

    and do parameter tuning. To be honest, I think this will be the part of data science
    that will be automated the fastest. I think parameter tuning will see diminishing
    returns for normal practitioners, but maybe not for the highest level Kagglers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. You should focus your time on feature engineering and feature creation.
    This is also something that the AI models can help with, but not completely master.
    After you’ve got some decent models, see what data you can add, what features
    you can create, or what transforms you can do to increase your results.
  prefs: []

    do projects than ever. You have to build things, and share your work. Fortunately,
    with these AI tools, it is also easier than ever to do that. It’s easier produce
    a web app. It’s easier to work with new packages that you’ve never worked with
