    — I know that sounds simple but it is more complicated than it seems. I see a
    lot of focus on Machine Learning in today’s Data Science work but without a well-designed
    and representative sample, all that effort might not bear fruit. For example,
    after training a brand new Machine Learning model variant, we need a representative
    sample to be able to determine the level of improvement (or degradation), compared
    to the previous version of the model — and just collecting a random sample is
    not always the right solution. A poorly-designed sample that does not represent
    the population well, can lead to wrong conclusions and business decisions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sampling is the process of collecting (or selecting) a subset of observations
    from a larger set. The collected smaller subset is called a ***“sample”*** and
    the larger set from which the sample was collected is called the ***“population”***.
    The sample is used to make inferences about the characteristics (or the properties)
    of the population. But why do need a sample? Why not just analyze the population
    itself?

- en: '**Cost:** In some cases, for example when the population is very large, it
    is not cost-effective to analyze the entire population. In other words, sample
    enables us to make inferences from the population by analyzing a much smaller
    subset of the population, which is the sample'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Time:** This is similar to cost. If the population is very large, it might
    not be feasible to spend the time to analyze the entire population. For example,
    U.S. Census makes inferences about the population of the U.S., based on a sample,
    since it is not cost and time efficient (among other reasons) to analyze the entire
    population of the U.S.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Efficiency:** A well-designed and collected sample theoretically provides
    a good representation of the entire population. In other words, inferences made
    from the sample, which is smaller than population, can be extended to the entire
    population. This makes the analysis much more efficient, compared to analyzing
    the entire population'

- en: Selection of the sampling methodology depends on the research and/or business
    questions and the type of population being studied. In other words, we first need
    to understand what we would like to measure and based on that we can select an
    appropriate sampling methodology to ensure the resulting sample represents the
    population in the study, given the existing limitations (e.g. time, cost, etc.).

- en: Population is divided into smaller groups or strata, based on one of the properties
    of the population. Then a sample is collected from each stratum, size of which
    is proportional to the weight of that stratum relative to the overall population.
    For example, if 55% of the population is female and 45% is male (and assuming
    female vs male is the selected stratification strategy), in order to collect a
    sample size of 100, 55 samples will be collected from the female stratum (since
    that stratum accounts for 55% of the population), while the remaining 45 will
    be collected from the male stratum.

- en: Population is divided into clusters and then a random sample of clusters are
    collected. On the surface Cluster and Stratified Sampling seem similar so let
    me explain the distinction. In Stratified Sampling, we collect a random sample
    from each stratum (similar to the example explained above). But in Cluster Sampling,
    a population is broken down into “n” clusters and then “m” clusters of them are
    randomly selected. When a cluster is selected, entire observations within that
    cluster are collected (unlike Stratified Sampling where a random sample of each
    stratum was collected).

    any of the above methodologies could be used and the resulting sample is used
    as the population for the next stage. For example, we may start with a population
    of 10,000 observations and collect a Simple Random Sample of 2,000 in the first
    stage. Then the 2,000 collected observations become the population for the second
    stage where we can collect another sample using a different methodology, such
    as any of the above 1 through 4 methodologies.

    the 100 students who are readily available to fill out the questionnaire at that
