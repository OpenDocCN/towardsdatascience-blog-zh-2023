    all, it is [one of the building blocks of the field](/the-three-building-blocks-of-data-science-2923dc8c2d78).

- en: This is the first article in a series which will attempt to give a concise,
    practical overview of different statistical tests and the situations in which
    they should be used. The information will strike a balance — not so long and technical
    as to be inaccessible, but not so short as to be useless.

    tests out there: the t-test. Even if you don’t quite know what it is, it’s likely
    you’ve heard the term thrown around. By the end of this article, you should understand
    how the test works and when you should use it.'

    checking out the prefatory article to this series, [*A Primer on Foundational

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'At its core, the t-test is used to compare data from *two*different samples
    of data. It takes two factors into account: the difference between the sample
    means and the variability of the sample data. Logically, this makes sense — simply
    comparing means is not sufficient to determine that your samples are actually
    different (means could very well differ with similar data sets, or be similar
    with very different data sets).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The t-test calculates a statistic known as the *t-score*, which takes both of
    the above factors into account. It can be calculated manually using a mildly annoying
    formula, but pretty much any statistical software will calculate it for you automatically.
    If you calculate the statistic manually, you can compare it to a critical t-value
    from preexisting tables (being greater than the t-value corresponds to the p-value
    being less than the desired level for your test, indicating a statistically significant
    difference between samples). Once again, statistical software will generally just
    tell you whether or not the calculated t-value is statistically significant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process for conducting this test varies from software to software, but most
    are straightforward to pick up with the software you choose to learn. The details
    of these calculations are omitted here, as the purpose of this article is to teach
    you what the t-test is and in what situations you should use it.
  prefs: []

- en: In line with that, let’s consider a hypothetical experiment in which you might
    use a t-test. Imagine you are a user researcher for a sports equipment company
    that is developing a pair of shoes for basketball players. The company’s engineers
    have two designs and want to know if there is a meaningful difference in a player’s
    jumping ability depending on the design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To test this, you obtain 40 basketball players (via a random sample), giving
    20 of them one pair of shoes (Group A) and the other 20 the second pair of shoes
    (Group B). The assignments to the two groups are also randomized. You then measure
    the vertical of each player when wearing the shoes and record the data in two
    sets, separated by the type of shoe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the
    vertical measurements of the two groups, you could use a t-test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve heard there are two types of t-tests — is this true?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ah, so you’re one step ahead of the game. Technically, the test we just talked
    about is called an *independent-samples* t-test. Why? Because the two means being
    compared are from different samples. This kind of t-test is generally used when
    our experiment uses a between-subjects design. Since the participants are different
    for each condition, the samples are considered independent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This same experiment could also be conducted using a within-subjects design.
    In this case, we would only collect 20 participants, and we would measure each
    participant’s vertical while wearing each shoe. One advantage of this is that
    it eliminates individual differences that could provide a false result (What if,
    despite the random samples and assignment, the players in one group simply just
    happened to be able to jump higher?).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any case, this structure renders the independent-samples t-test inappropriate;
    instead, we would use what is called a *paired-samples* t-test. This name comes
    from the fact that because each participant appears in both data sets, they are
    in a sense paired.

    quantitative).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    distributed. This cannot be known for certain, but you can generally settle for
    an educated guess based on the sample distributions.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    shouldn’t be too different).

    this is precisely where nonparametric alternatives come in. Depending on which
    t-test you intended to use, you should now shift gears:'

    these tests in your statistical software of choice without too much trouble; the
    important thing is just that you know when to use them.

    should use a t-test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Does your experiment have one factor/independent variable (the t-test is not
    suitable for experiments with multiple factors)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    use a between-subjects or a within-subjects design? And does your experiment meet
    the conditions for using the parametric t-test?
