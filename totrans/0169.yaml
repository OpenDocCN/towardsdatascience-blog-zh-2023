    — or Colab, as it is more commonly known — remains my go-to resource. It removes
    the hassle of environment setup for both presenters and attendees, additionally
    offering free access to powerful computing resources like GPUs and TPUs. With
    its easily shareable links, Colab makes the entire learning process more efficient
    and effective. To make the most of what Colab has to offer, I consistently keep
    an eye on its latest releases and updates.

    occasionally, the extensive list of new and enhanced features deserves a more
    comprehensive article like this one. My previous compilation of Colab’s significant
    features was in 2022, indicating it’s time for an updated overview.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, when users paste data into an empty code cell, Colab automatically generates
    code to create a `pd.DataFrame`. This enhancement eliminates the extra steps traditionally
    involved in this process, making it a seamless user experience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data visualization in Colab is now more accessible with its new feature → the
    automated generation of plots from Pandas DataFrames. When you execute a code
    cell that concludes with a DataFrame reference, an auto-plotting button materializes
    at the lower right of your output.

    with a wide array of data operations. With Google Colab, users can interact with
    these dataframes in real time. When a dataframe is loaded and displayed in Colab,
    a calculator-like icon becomes visible, as shown below.

    field. It’s also possible to set value boundaries in searches. Consider identifying
    all USA-origin cars from 1970–1971 with eight cylinders and a fuel efficiency
    of at least 15 miles per gallon.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Colab now supports two new features designed to streamline the way users run
    code cells in their notebooks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first of these features allows users to effortlessly run a set of cells
    directly from the notebook’s table of contents. This can be done using the `**Run
    cells in section**` option found in the context menu, represented by three vertical
    dots.

    Author
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second feature focuses on setting prerequisites within a notebook. **Users
    can now designate specific cells to automatically run when a notebook is opened**.
    This can be set up through the notebook settings dialog, located under the `**Edit**`
    menu, where there’s an option to `Automatically run the first cell or section`.
    If a notebook begins with just one cell, that particular cell will auto-run every
    time the notebook is accessed. Similarly, if a notebook starts with a section,
    then the entire initial section of cells will be auto-executed when the notebook
    is opened.

    between different languages. Users can now easily switch between installed kernels
    by going to `Edit` and then `Notebook settings`. The **R programming language
    is one of the available options,** as it’s installed by default.
