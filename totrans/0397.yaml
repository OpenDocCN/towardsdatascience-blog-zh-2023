- en: An important part of every data science professional’s growth journey is evolving
    from data preparation and model training to owning the entire machine learning
    development cycle. The full cycle includes data ingestion, data cleaning and preparation,
    feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, model deployment, model
    serving, and model maintenance. This wider-encompassing ownership model likely
    requires the data science professional to improve their conceptual understanding
    and applied understanding across the entire development cycle. Perhaps the most
    important moment in this learning journey is understanding that the model training
    is often the easiest step in the process. [Designing Machine Learning Systems
    by Chip Huyen](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/)
    provides an overview of the machine learning development cycle through a conceptual
    lens.

    it to have more longevity in terms of its usefulness. Therefore, it could serve
    as a useful reference for a wide range of tech professionals who might not understand
    each page on day one. That being said, the conceptual side of machine learning
    development can be less approachable to the data science novice. I recommend prospective
    readers to have a strong understanding of the following before reading this book:'

    recommend starting with a less advanced book. The appropriate audience ranges
    from a recent STEM graduate to any experienced tech professional looking to learn
    more about machine learning development; however, the latter will likely enjoy
    the book more. Concepts are harder to understand without some real-world experience
    in data science.

- en: “Data leakage refers to the phenomenon when a form of the label ‘leaks’ into
    the set of features used for making predictions, and this same information is
    not available during inference.” This would be equivalent to trying to guess how
    many fingers someone is holding up behind their back when there is a mirror reflecting
    the answer back to you. The mirror reveals information that should not be available
    if the goal is to measure how accurate of a forecaster you are.

- en: Before reading this book, I was not aware how frequently data leakage can occur
    during the model development life cycle. One reason for the frequency is that
    data leakage is not always obvious. From personal experience, I was recently a
    victim of data leakage when I oversampled my imbalanced dataset prior to splitting
    the data. Data leakage occurred because some of the replicated records were in
    both the training AND test sets. I had to adjust my code so the data was split
    much earlier in the process.

- en: Machine learning model development should be a series of phases, where you layer
    on complexity over time. Because machine learning is inherently complex, the first
    phase should be trying to solve the business problem via simple heuristics rather
    than developing a model. If simple heuristics are insufficient, then you should
    try developing and deploying a simple model. Going end-to-end early provides more
    visibility into the process and makes it easier to identify bugs as you add more
    complexity. If a simple model does not meet your expectations, try optimizing
    the simple model with different objective functions, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
    If that fails to meet your expectations, try more complex models (e.g. neural
    networks).

- en: While working on a recent project, the most difficult part of the development
    was deployment. Even once I was able to deploy the model successfully, it uncovered
    several additional roadblocks outside of the scope of my responsibilities. If
    I had instead prioritized end-to-end progress over model optimization, our team
    likely would have uncovered these roadblocks much sooner. The overall time until
    completion for the new feature might have been reduced.

    any specific model due to randomness inherent in the process. However, any information
    that you believe will be useful for maintenance, debugging, team coordination,
    or model reproducibility should at least be under consideration for tracking.

- en: While tracking is extremely beneficial, it can slow down experimentation, I
    would recommend having a plan to automate this process as much as possible. On
    a recent project, Azure Machine Learning helped me track the package versions
    in my production environment, which was key for debugging a version-related scikit-learn
    bug.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Designing Machine Learning Systems is a fantastic addition to any data science
    professional’s library. Chip Huyen zooms out on each step in the machine learning
    development life cycle by focusing on concepts rather than specific implementations.
    After reading this book, you will have new frameworks to help you apply best practices
    throughout the entire machine learning development life cycle. For many of the
    concepts, Chip provides additional resources for further exploration. Just remember
    — the best practices she discusses must be combined with knowledge outside of
    the scope of this book in order to apply them to a specific model implementation.
