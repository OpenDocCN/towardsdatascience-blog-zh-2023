- en: Sometimes the smallest of things can take a lot longer than we think. When building
    data visualisations, we will reach a point where we need to decide on a colour
    scheme — something that may seem simple but is very important and can either make
    your data visualisation flop or pop. At this stage we can often spend hours choosing
    the right shade of blue or checking whether we have enough contrast between colours.

- en: When choosing the right colour palette for a data visualisation we need to consider
    numerous factors, including the type of visualisation, the audience, colour contrast,
    colour blindness and much more. Understanding these various factors ensures that
    the story we are trying to tell through our data visualisations is getting across
    to the reader in the best possible way.

    process. Within this article, we will cover four powerful tools you can add to
    your data scientist/analyst toolbox.

    aimed at banding, it can easily be used for data visualisations.'

    the spacebar. You can repeat this until you find a palette you like. If you find
    a colour you like but don’t like the other colours, you can lock that colour,
    hit the spacebar and regenerate the remaining colours.

    colours, and the available tools are also limited, such as being able to use colour
    theory rules.

    [**ColorBrewer 2.0**](https://colorbrewer2.org/). This free online tool has been
    designed and developed by Professor Cynthia Brewer at Pennsylvania State University
    as a tool for creating compelling and accessible colour maps for anyone involved
    in creating maps.

    colour schemes. The selection of which will depend on what you are planning to
    show in your data visualisation.

- en: When looking at colour palettes side by side, it may be easy to distinguish
    between each colour. However, when dealing with a map, colours that are not next
    to each other on the palette may be next to each other on the map. Therefore it
    is important to understand if your chosen palette will work with your data on
    a map.

    to use. For example, this might be based on existing branding for you or for the
    company you work with. You can then explore the different colour relationships,
    including monochromatic, adjacent, triad, and tetrad. All of which change the
    feel of your chosen colour palette.

    scheme applied to a simple website or a graphic. This helps you get an idea of
    how your chosen colour palette looks. Additionally, it provides an option to simulate
    colour blindness, which is essential to making sure your visualisations are accessible
    to everyone.
