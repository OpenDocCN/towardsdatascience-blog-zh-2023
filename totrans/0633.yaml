    with [TDS Editors](https://medium.com/u/7e12c71dfa81?source=post_page-----42057a87814a--------------------------------).
    I resisted typing a 15-minute long read then to include 23 buzzwords for 2023
    and yet, I knew I had to write about those 10 buzzwords soon! Through comments
    on that blog, Twitter DMs, and LinkedIn messages, I heard a few of those 10 words
    that I should have covered and a few new ones. With that, here is Part 2 to the
    data buzzwords you should know about in 2023 to catch up on the data vocab!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2023, companies will either live or die by their data strategies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the increase in the number of data sources, acquisition channels, and insights
    consumed by a business, an organization must be equipped to scale and handle the
    changing demands by adding/removing data resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data scalability is the ability of data, databases, or any data systems to increase
    or decrease the processing, without a significant impact on performance and cost
    in response to changes in processing demands. Scalability is quintessential today
    as it allows a business to grow and generate dollars without being held back by
    its data structure or lack of capacity and resources.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the challenges that organizations consuming data face today is the decentralized
    nature of data management and governance which has led people to talk about data
    mesh in 2023.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data mesh takes the approach to build a decentralized data architecture for
    the decentralized data with organizations. It essentially stitches together data
    held across multiple data silos (cloud, on-premise data, application database,
    BI dashboards, analytics applications, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is often a comparison between data mesh and data fabric — the better option
    for organizations and let me tell you, they are very different. While a data fabric
    governs and manages multiple data sourcesfrom a single, centralized system, a
    data mesh does the complete opposite. The end goal remains the same — to connect
    distributed data across different locations and organizations.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lakehouse has been an emerging concept for the past few years and 2023
    for me is the year when lakehouses flex their functionality and capabilities (peak
    of their existence).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m sure everyone reading this blog must have heard or read of [Databricks](https://medium.com/u/5ae67e7eecef?source=post_page-----42057a87814a--------------------------------)
    atleast once. Databricks is a data lakehouse and what a data lakehouse does is
    combine the operational excellence, reliability, security, compliance, performance
    efficiency, cost optimization, and scale of organizational data to enable business
    intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) on all that good company data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t know about you but I had a question — *how are data lakes different
    from data warehouses?*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both are widely accepted and used for storing big data, but what I understand
    the difference is — a data lake is a vast pool of raw data with no defined purpose
    when the data enters whereas, a data warehouse is a structured repository that
    hosts filtered, processed data for a defined purpose.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data is the center of any conversation happening in the tech world today and
    if we talk about how much data is created every day, the current estimate in 2023
    stands at 1.145 trillion MB per day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We collect, process, and store data for “regular business activities” and once
    the project is done with, generally fail to use that data for other purposes.
    We define dark data as data acquired through various sources but not used to analyze
    or derive insights for decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Storing and securing data incurs more expense to the business and sometimes,
    a greater risk to the organization than value. Some examples of dark data for
    an organization could be log files, account information, financial archives, data
    of former employees, etc. that are no longer useful and are sitting there consuming
    space.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I heard the word Web3 on a podcast in mid-2022 where a stand-up comedian talked
    about his interests other than comedy and he talked about Web3, the opportunities
    that exist with Web3, and the finances involved in its emergence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was intrigued by what that meant and googled to read that Web3 is the third
    generation of the World Wide Web which introduces a decentralized internet backed
    by blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. We started seeing a Web3-friendly
    approach in 2022 and in 2023, more and more countries are developing and passing
    legislation to position themselves as “Web3-friendly” zones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web3 is here to completely change how data is stored and used. Instead of data
    stored and controlled by one central entity in a giant server, data will now be
    owned by millions of user devices linked together by one network (decentralization)
    — improving personal data ownership. Web3 employs a machine-based understanding
    of data to develop more intelligent and connected web experiences for users.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2023 is the year for Data Analysts. One of the pain points for any data analyst
    is maintaining consistency across all reporting efforts. So, if we want 2023 to
    be a good year for the analysts, we pivot to synchronization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data synchronization is precisely what it sounds like — making sure your data
    is consistent, identical, and accurate across all applications, regardless of
    their location (basically, every data analyst’s nightmare).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I read an example in a blog sometime to better understand data synchronization
    and here’s my hot take to understand the term — say, we added a new album with
    five songs to one of the servers of a music streaming platform server, so, with
    data synchronization, all other music streaming platform servers (under an agreement)
    get identical sets of the album. Data synchronization plays a prime role in database
    management. Data synchronization also brings data governance and secured access
    controls.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The worldwide cloud market is expected to [grow](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-31-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023)
    by 42% in 2023 and I anticipate a mass movement across organizations and industries
    to optimize cloud costs and spending this year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Organizations are moving to the cloud, debating staying on-premise or going
    with a hybrid model, and amongst all those good conversations, a distributed cloud
    emerges as an option where multiple clouds are used by an organization to meet
    the performance expectations, compliance needs, and support computing requirements
    while being centrally managed from a public cloud provider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I confused distributed cloud with the hybrid cloud when I first learned about
    it and wanted to put together recommendations for my workplace here’s how they
    differ — hybrid cloud consists of multiple public cloud services with on-premises
    infrastructure whereas distributed cloud is managed by one central public cloud
    provider.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automation of everyday jobs has been a priority for a lot of organizations in
    2023 (so is for my team) and hyper-automation targets to automate everything in
    an organization that can be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperautomation aims to streamline data processes, artificial intelligence (AI)
    jobs, robotic process automation (RPA), and other technologies to run autonomously
    without any human intervention. Hyperautomation starts by identifying what projects
    to automate, choosing the appropriate automation tools, driving swiftness through
    multiple automated processes, and extending their capabilities using various flavors
    of data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Human-Centered AI as a word has been floating around for a while now. Everything
    we do and create today does not operate in a void. It will involve a human at
    some point of interaction. I’ve always been curious to see what would a practical
    implementation of Human-Centered Data Science look like and there are a few projects
    surfacing in 2023 where human interactions with the product lead the business
    decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like to define Human-Centered Data Science as a concept to understand how
    people interact and make sense of social situations, enabling humans to explore
    and gain insights and design data models with the end-user in mind (not just the
    business).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s look at it this way — data is nothing but the digital traces of human
    interactions. A human-centered approach can enhance the choices data scientists
    make every day, by making the process more transparent, asking questions, and
    considering the social context of the data.

  prefs: []

- en: '*Observe > Investigate > Model > Contextualize > Execute*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I first came to know about Decision Intelligence (DI) in 2021 during my internship
    with PepsiCo where one of the projects I came across was to use decision intelligence
    and forecast the sales of Pepsi food products across demographics before and after
    the Super Bowl. DI offers a clean and neat structure for data-driven decision-making.

    data each with its own set of characteristics being the core force. With decision
    intelligence, you create 3 different types of models: human-based decisions, machine-based,
    and hybrid decisions. The process involves a heavy reduction algorithm that combines
    data science with social science, decision theory, and managerial sciences.'
  prefs: []

    with an interest in analytics to work on decision intelligence by the day.
