    I discussed in detail everything you need to know about working with geospatial
    raster data. This type of data is associated with a specific geographical area.
    However, it’s not possible to study how that area has changed over time by analysing
    a single raster file. This guide aims to introduce the reader to satellite image
    time series and explain why this data is incredibly important in addressing current
    and future challenges facing the Earth.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sentinel-2 captures 13 spectral bands, divided into visible bands (shorter wavelengths)
    and infrared bands (longer wavelengths). The visible bands are the only ones we
    can see and are made up of red, green and blue bands (visible bands). The other
    bands can pick up other information about the area below, but we can’t see them.
    This is one of the reasons why SITS are not usually analysed by simply looking
    at them but by using different algorithms that can process all the bands.

    management. By tracking changes in forest cover, health and composition over time,
    they can help identify areas of concern and inform management decisions. For example,
    SITS can be used to track changes in forest cover over time, helping to identify
    areas of deforestation and assess the extent and rate of forest loss. They can
    therefore be useful for improving reforestation, afforestation or forest restoration
    practices.

    changes because the images were taken by the satellite under different conditions,

    In particular, 3D neural networks (3D-NN) are well suited to making predictions
    from satellite image time series. 3D-NN is a type of neural network that takes
    a 3D input, and a SITS is a three-dimensional input because it’s a collection
    of 2D images. For example, I. Gallo et al. made a 3D Feature Pyramid Network model
    to perform crop mapping of Sentinel-2 images time series [1]. The architecture
    they made takes as input 30 images, each having 48 × 48 pixels and 13 bands and
    returns a 48 × 48 segmentation mask. Each pixel of the output contains the class
    of the crop that grows in that location.

    including Landsat, MODIS and Sentinel. These images are typically acquired at
    regular intervals, ranging from daily to monthly, depending on the satellite platform
    and the specific application. The resulting image sequences can be analysed for
    a variety of purposes, including improving crop management, tracking forest health,
    monitoring the effects of climate change on the environment, planning urban infrastructure,
    and assisting areas affected by natural disasters. SITS can be analysed in different
    ways, depending on the change you want to highlight.
