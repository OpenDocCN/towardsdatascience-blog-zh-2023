    the closely related field of protein design has more recently entered a new era
    of advancements through the power of deep learning. However, existing machine
    learning (ML) models for protein design have been limited in their ability to
    incorporate non-protein entities into the design process, handling only protein
    components. In our new preprint, we introduce a new deep learning model, “CARBonAra”,
    that considers any kind of molecular environment surrounding the protein, and
    as such can design proteins that bind any kind of molecule: drug-like ligands,
    cofactors, substrates, nucleic acids, or even other proteins. By leveraging a
    geometric transformer architecture from our previous ML model, CARBonAra predicts
    protein sequences from backbone scaffolds while being aware of the restraints
    imposed by molecules of any nature. This groundbreaking approach could help to
    expand the versatility of ML models for engineering proteins with desired functions
    by tuning specific interactions with other cellular components of any kind.**'

    is possible. Protein design, that is the creation of new proteins with desired
    functions and properties, is such an area of action; in particular one with profound
    implications across various disciplines ranging from biology and medicine to biotechnology
    and materials science. While physics-based methods have made progress in finding
    amino acid sequences that fold to a given protein structure, deep learning techniques
    have emerged as game-changers, significantly enhancing design success rates and
    versatility.

- en: CARBonAra’s core being based on the PeSTo model allows it to incorporate any
    kind of non-protein molecules, including nucleic acids, lipids, ions, small ligands,
    cofactors, or other proteins, into the process of designing a new protein. Thus,
    given an input protein structure with one or more ligands within interaction distance,
    CARBonAra predicts residue-wise amino acid confidences from whose maxima one can
    reconstruct protein sequences. For this, CARBonAra takes backbone scaffolds accompanied
    by non-protein molecules as inputs and generates a space of potential sequences
    that can be further constrained by specific functional or structural requirements
    -such as fixing certain amino acids, for example if they are known essentialy
    for a given function. CARBonAra offers an unprecedented level of flexibility and
    depth in protein design by considering the molecular context surrounding the protein
    of interest, which means it can craft regions specialized for binding ions, substrates,
    nucleic acids, lipids, other proteins, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our evaluations, CARBonAra performs on par with state-of-the-art methods
    like ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1, while demonstrating similar computational efficiency
    -all being quite fast. The model achieves quite sequence recovery rates similar
    to those of ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1 for the design of protein monomers and protein
    complexes, but on top of that it can handle protein designs that entail non-protein
    molecules, which none of the other methods can even handle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the remarkable features of CARBonAra is its ability to tailor sequences
    to meet specific objectives by incorporating various constraints. For example,
    it can optimize sequence identity, minimize similarity, or achieve low sequence
    similarity. Moreover, by utilizing CARBonAra with structural trajectories from
    molecular dynamics simulations, we observed that we can improve sequence recovery
    rates, especially in cases where previous methods showed lower success rates.
