    and services. However, many data scientists get too caught up in creating the
    perfect model and using state of the art techniques. By doing this, they forget
    the most important thing: delivering a functional minimum viable product (MVP).
    In this post, I’ll discuss three reasons why it’s better to focus on getting a
    working MVP first before spending too much time on creating a complex model. To
    end the post, I give three tips for creating a MVP.**'

- en: When I started as a data scientist around six years ago, I wasn’t really interested
    in topics like Naive Bayes, linear regression, and statistics. Maybe it was because
    of my mathematical background, and I had already learned these topics during my
    studies. Instead, I was way more interested in neural networks, language models,
    computer vision, and reinforcement learning. These topics intrigued me, and I
    took courses to learn them as quickly as possible. When I had to deal with real
    business problems at companies, I always tried complex models and solutions that
    I found fun to work on, often involving deep learning, datasets scraped from the
    web, and complex architecture. Unfortunately, my code was messy and hard to read.

- en: I remember one project that I spent months working on. I had weekly meetings
    with the business, but I was the one who was talking, and the end result was too
    complex and hardly used. Important takeaways from that period are to not overcomplicate
    machine learning solutions and to talk less. With this post, I hope I can prevent
    you from making the same mistakes I made and explain what to do instead.

    there are three main reasons, which I will explain here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reason 1\. The business doesn’t care
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first and most important reason is that the business doesn’t care! Your
    stakeholders are not interested in the technical details of your model. Whether
    you used boosted trees or a neural network, to them, it’s all the same. What they
    want to know is how your model is helping them achieve their business goals. If
    the model needs to be retrained often, you can justify your decision to use a
    simple model like logistic regression over a neural network because it’s super
    fast to train.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, the main goal of a machine learning model is not to reach 100% accuracy.
    Instead, a machine learning model helps with business processes. Spending too
    much time optimizing the model will delay the time it takes to deliver a working
    product to the market. It’s better to create an MVP, ensure it meets the business
    requirements, and get it into production. It’s essential to take not only performance
    but also interpretability, computation speed, development costs, robustness, and
    training time into account. These factors are important too and can be as relevant
    to business people as performance.
  prefs: []

- en: Besides yourself, there are other people who care about a complex model and
    state-of-the-art methods. Those people are often researchers or data science colleagues.
    If you work too closely with them instead of with the business, you can get to
    the point where you believe modeling is the main goal. To overcome this, try to
    work closer with business people. Demo your product after every new feature implementation
    and ask the business if your assumptions are correct. Decisions that seem small
    can be really important for business people.

- en: Reason 2\. A complex model adds less value than a working MVP
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more time you spend on the model, the less time you have for good engineering
    principles, such as writing modular code, testing, architecture, logging, and
    monitoring. Setting these things up in a good way at the beginning saves a lot
    of time later. You can easily add new features to a solid codebase. This is more
    valuable than having a complex model in a Jupyter Notebook that performs slightly
    better but doesn’t run in production. Another benefit of a simple model is interpretability,
    which can help convince stakeholders because they can see the predictions make
    sense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Especially in the beginning, focus on creating a product that works and has
    robust code and a well-crafted CI/CD pipeline. This makes it easier to improve
    the solution later on. If the business doesn’t feel the urge to improve the current
    solution, you can move on to another project. You didn’t waste your time creating
    a ‘perfect’ model.

- en: What relates to this is the Pareto principle. It is a rule that states that
    80% of results can be achieved through 20% of our efforts (aka the 80/20 rule).
    Often, creating a complex model that performs slightly better than a simple model
    doesn’t fall into the 80% of the results but is a task that is hard and takes
    a lot of time. The complex model is that last hard-to-reach 20% that takes 80%
    of the effort. Before you start, convince yourself it is worth it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more complex the project, the more resources and time are needed to maintain
    it. This means that you’ll spend more time fixing bugs, optimizing the model,
    keeping the data up to date, and less time adding new features or improving the
    product. A simple project, on the other hand, requires less maintenance, which
    means that you can spend more time iterating on the MVP and adding new features
    to improve the product.

- en: An important thought to keep in mind is that the best solution is often the
    simplest solution that fits the requirements. This can help you determine if that
    deep learning state-of-the-art model is truly worth the extra work that comes
    with it! If there are two models that perform equally well, and one is simple
    and the other is complex, go with the simple one.

    with reinforcement learning. It was quite complex, and we were progressing slowly.
    The business became a bit annoyed and disappointed because we couldn’t show good
    results. When we switched our solution method to (good old) mathematical optimization,
    it went much faster! It was less interesting, but we gained the trust of the business
    and could implement new features and constraints easily.'

    of the new product is something you can figure out later within the data science
    team. For now, you should focus on what the business finds important and what
    they think the output should be. Don’t forget to ask what they think a perfect
    solution would look like. This can help determine must-haves and nice-to-haves.
    For the MVP, you need to focus on the must-haves.

    scientists, at least one business expert should be involved. If possible, an end-user
    who knows exactly what the product should do in the end. You need a person you
    can go to at any time during development to help you make the right decisions.'

    to the “how” and focusing on ML techniques without listening to what the stakeholder
    wants is a recipe for project failure. Make sure to listen without interruption
    and don’t flag product features as impossible during this meeting.

    it should contain all business features in plain English (or any other language,
    of course). Below is a simple example of a diagram for a chatbot:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you work with creative and inventive people, and probably you are one yourself,
    you might find it hard to stick to the initial plan. You showcase your product
    and people can respond: “Wouldn’t it be cool to add a computer vision feature
    here?” You think, “Hell yeah, that sounds fun!” But that is the moment where the
    problems begin because before you know it, you are building a complex system,
    and it becomes really hard to deliver on time. A better way to handle this is
    to say thank you and note it down. After MVP delivery, you can revisit those ideas
    and decide if you should go for it. You can also decide to set time limits on
    the experimentation phase. This can help you focus on the core problem and try
    only a certain number of strategies. After the experimentation phase, you can
    continue with the most successful solution.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While creating a complex machine learning model may seem like the best way to
    deliver a high-performing product, it’s better to focus on delivering a working
    MVP first. A working MVP demonstrates the value of your product to stakeholders,
    and it’s easier to iterate on a simple model. Remember that the business cares
    more about how your product can help them achieve their goals than the technical
    details of your model. Therefore, focus on delivering a working MVP that meets
    the requirements, and worry less about creating the perfect machine learning model.

    you! You can try all the cool new stuff that is out there.'
