    decide which course to take.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I was looking for my first online Data Science coding course in 2019, I
    couldn’t get over this feeling of ***analysis paralysis*** and I spent way too
    long trying to decide between different options. Then, when I finally made a decision
    and spent £20 on a course, I soon found that it was the wrong one for me, and
    I didn’t even finish it.

    ([2015](https://oro.open.ac.uk/43566/)) and ResearchGate ([2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330316898_The_MOOC_pivot))
    have estimated that completion rates of online courses can be as low as 3%.

    courses and have learned important lessons about how to pick the right course
    and maximise its value. In this article, I’ll share some of the best courses I’ve
    taken and share 5 key considerations that I use to help me decide between courses.

    that *$$$ courses = better courses*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Truth be told, however, some of the best resources are completely free. Free
    platforms like YouTube, freeCodeCamp and Towards Data Science host thousands of
    high-quality online courses covering virtually every data skill, and they’re always
    my first port of call whenever I need to learn something. Because they’re free,
    it’s really easy to “try before you buy,” which means they’re a great way to test
    the course’s suitability before you commit to spending money or embarking on the
    whole course.

    free courses on YouTube and eventually decided on this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY&t=1739s&pp=ygUJbGVhcm4gZ2l0)
    by Tech With Tim. It was short (40 mins), free, and had lots of social proof (high
    views/ratings), and covered everything that I needed to get me up and running.
    If you’re starting a new topic from scratch, it’s much better to try a small course
    (like a YouTube one) rather than committing to a full marathon course. You can
    always migrate to a paid course later (if you need), but why start with paid if
    you haven’t first checked the quality of the free options?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first online course I took was a generalist Python course. While it was
    an excellent course, it wasn’t particularly focused on *Data Science* use cases
    of Python (my learning objective), and I was being forced to complete modules
    on areas in which I had no interest (e.g., web app development, geospatial analysis).
    It quickly became boring/unproductive, and before long I’d ditched it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid making this kind of mistake, my advice to you is to start with a course
    which is tailored towards a small and specific goal, and then build on it later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, rather than taking on a lofty goal like “learn to code,” try breaking
    this down into a smaller goal like “learn to code like a Data Scientist.” Then,
    break this down further into an even smaller goal by picking a specific language
    (e.g., Python), and then pick a Python course which focuses on a specific skill
    like data analysis (e.g., a course like this [one](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/learn-code-data-analysis/content-section-overview-0?active-tab=description-tab))
    or machine learning (e.g., a course like this [one](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Python for a very specific purpose (data analysis), and have since expanded on
    this to learn other things (like web development or machine learning) as and when
    I’ve needed.'

    locally on your own computer?

- en: Lots of eLearning platforms have in-built code editors which allow you to write
    and execute code within the browser/app. The advantage of this is that it’s super
    easy to just start coding, without any installations or setup. If you pick a course
    on a mobile-friendly platform/app like Enki, you can even code along while you’re
    on your commute or sat on the toilet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *disadvantage* of courses like these is that you don’t necessarily learn
    how to run code “in the wild” outside of that specific eLearning platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your goal is just to learn the syntax and “try it out,” then courses with
    in-built coding editors are a great solution. Courses on sites like CodeAcademy,
    DataCamp and freeCodeCamp are fantastic for this purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, however, you want to learn on real-world systems, try finding a course that
    encourages you to “code along” by yourself. For example, of the ones I’ve already
    mentioned, courses like the [SQL Tutorial — Full Database Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY)
    are great for this.

    is better than binge-studying)

    still a long way to go, I know a heck of a lot more Arabic now than I did 324
    days ago. On some days, I spend 30 minutes on Duolingo. On others I spend 2\.
    But, by focusing on the streak, it helps me stay consistent and ensures I do *something*
    even on days where I have low motivation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s exactly the same with coding courses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re studying an online course alongside work or university, chances are
    that your motivation and availability will fluctuate a lot. By committing to maintaining
    a streak, you ensure that you stay consistent even on the busy days. In the long
    run, this is also far more sustainable than “binge-studying.” Memory curves mean
    that we easily forget what we learn on a single day, and it’s only when we regularly
    revisit topics that the learning sinks in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consequently, when you’re deciding between courses, try to find one that enables
    you to build small streaks. If the course is a 10-hour non-interactive lecture,
    it might be difficult to do “2-minute stints” on busy days, and you’ll be inclined
    not to bother. If, by contrast, the course includes lots of example questions
    and small exercises, it’ll be much easier to fit in quick episodes and maintain
    a streak.

    up for a long hard slog. If instead you break that goal down into *mini*-goals
    (e.g., “complete this chapter”) and continuously reward yourself for meeting those
    mini-goals, you’ll find it much easier to stay motivated.

    I would try to reward myself at the end of each chapter with a small sugary treat
    and by applying what I’d just learned on my online portfolio. These may seem like
    trivial rewards, but they actually really helped me to stay motivated because
    there was always something tangible to aim for in the short-term.
