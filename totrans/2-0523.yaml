    post where we will start using the dataset to inform realignment decisions. There
    is a common complaint that conference realignment destroys traditional rivalries
    and the regional aspect of college football. It’s true that college sports tend
    to be regional. It’s even in the name of the conferences themselves: Pacific 12,
    Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, and Big East Conferences to name a few. Some get
    even more specific when we include the FCS: Ohio Valley Conference. Of course,
    the days of regional conferences in the FBS are long gone. In the last few days,
    it looks like the Pac 12 may be a relic of the past, as well.'

    the future of the beloved game of college football. For those of you who did not
    read part 1 or 2 a quick synopsis is that I created my own data set compiled from
    sources across the web. These data include [basic information about each FBS program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_programs),
    a non-canonical approximation of all [college football rivalries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games),
    [stadium size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_stadiums),
    [historical performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_bowl_records),
    [frequency appearances in AP top 25 polls](https://collegepollarchive.com/football/index.cfm),
    whether the school is an [AAU](https://www.aau.edu/) or [R1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States)
    institution (historically important for membership in the Big Ten and Pac 12),
    the number of [NFL draft picks](https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2020-04-27/college-football-teams-most-nfl-draft-picks-2000),
    [data on program revenue](https://graphics.wsj.com/table/NCAA_2019) from 2017–2019,
    and a [recent estimate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MiUOwx8X3H2bSkUOz8a1YhceyJWLLCoJ/view)
    on the size of college football fan bases. In part 1 we found that there were
    several features that correlated strongly with fan base size, so in part 2, we
    developed a linear regression and random forest regression model to predict fan
    base size.

    on a traditional core. You can think about them like a new computer hard disk
    drive. Cleanly organized in a contiguous manner in regional conferences. However,
    over the years, just like we create, manipulate, and delete files on our disk
    drive, the college football world has seen new conferences formed (mostly recently
    the AAC), old conferences implode (Big East football), and once midwestern conferences
    grow from New York to LA. The most interesting case study of this is the Western
    Athletic Conference. Below is a membership [graphic from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Athletic_Conference),
    and the WAC has pulled itself up by its own bootstraps many times. I’ll reserve
    a deep dive post for another day.'

    disk drive. What if we came up with conferences from scratch? If we strip away
    the tradition and the grant of rights, how will schools group together in 2022?
    The perfect approach to answer this question lies in an unsupervised machine learning
    approach called clustering. Unsupervised machine learning means that we will be
    feeding our model unlabeled data in the hopes of eliciting hidden patterns. Specifically,
    the goal of clustering is to by group together similar observations. These groups
    may be obvious or non-obvious even after a thorough exploratory data analysis.

    clustering. The idea behind k-means is described well [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-introduction/).
    Essentially, the user defines the desired number of clusters, k. The algorithm
    randomly assigns k centroids and finds the centroid closest to each item using
    the Euclidean distance. The item is then considered a member of that centroid’s
    cluster. Then, the centroids are shifted to the average location of the items
    assigned to that centroid. In the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)
    package, there is a user-defined number of iterations for this process.

    we can start anew.

    function. The most basic split we can do in college football is the Power 5 v.
    Group of 5 teams, so let’s start there. This means we want to divide the data
    into 2 clusters. The model won’t know that these two clusters are Power 5 and
    Group of 5 teams. It will only work to find a way to divide the 133 FBS teams
    into two groups. Given the differences in revenue and fan base size between Power
    5 and Group of 5 teams, my initial hypothesis is that this should be pretty easy.

    Houston, TCU, Texas Tech, and UCF), two Pac 12 teams (Oregon State and Washington
    State) and one ACC team (Wake Forest). Given that the data is based on revenue
    pre-dating the inaugural Big 12 season of BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF, it
    is no surprise that they are clustered with their current Group of 5 brethren.
    Baylor, TCU, and Texas Tech are in a state crowded with competition for football
    allegiance, and casual fans in the Lone Star State often gravitate to Texas A&M
    or Texas. For those who have been following the delicate future of the Pac 12,
    many have predicted that Oregon State and Washington State could be left out of
    any realignment raids of the Pac 12 by the Big Ten and/or Big 12.

    Tulane. This season is the first time Tulane has been ranked this millennium,

    For [30 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football), however,
    they were a member of the SEC conference.

    rivalry and geographic information in addition to revenue and fan base size, we
    can consider both money and tradition when forming our new conferences.
