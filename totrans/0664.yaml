    of the context in which your data was collected and how it relates to the bigger

    But now, James’s interest peaked, and after researching the amount for a deposit
    required to own a Volkswagen ID.3, he made the conscious decision to purchase
    one. And so he did. By mid-2021, James owned an electric vehicle. James wasn’t
    the only one that decided to take action; several million UK residents did. Either
    by increasing recycling efforts, reducing electric and gas usage or purchasing
    electric vehicles. The UK’s public awareness of the effect of climate change contributed
    to the increase in sales of electric vehicles in 2021\. Hence, in 2021 the number
    of electric vehicles sold was over 300,000; this is more than double the amount
