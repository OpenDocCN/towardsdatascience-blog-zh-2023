    footprint to the around 24 kgCO2e](/the-carbon-footprint-of-chatgpt-66932314627d).
    With little information available at the time about ChatGPT’s user base, my estimate
    was based on the assumption that the ChatGPT service was running on 16 A100 GPUs.
    In lieu of recent reports that estimate that ChatGPT had 590 million visits in
    January [1], it’s likely that ChatGPT requires way more GPUs to service its users.

    geographic locations. This makes it very difficult to estimate ChatGPT’s total
    daily carbon footprint, because we would need to know exactly how many GPUs are
    running in which regions in order to incorporate the carbon intensity of electricity
    in each region into the carbon footprint estimate.

    simpler, because we do not need to know in which geographic regions ChatGPT is
    running. Below I explain how one can go about estimating ChatGPT’s energy consumption
    and I specifically produce an estimate of ChatGPT’s electricity use in January
    2023\. The scope is limited to January 2023 because we have some ChatGPT traffic
    estimates for this month.

    GPT-3.

    was deployed on 16 Nvidia A100 40 GB GPUs and handled an average of 558 requests
    per hour for a total of 230,768 queries. Queries were not batched. The 914 KWh
    account for CPU, RAM and GPU usage [2].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    electricity usage.

    model) has 175b parameters, so everything else held equal, their energy consumption
    should be quite similar.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, a few things suggest that ChatGPT’s electricity consumption per query could
    be lower than BLOOM’s. For instance, ChatGPT receives way more requests per hour
    than BLOOM did, which could lead to a lower energy consumption per query. Figure
    1 below plots BLOOM’s electricity use against the number of requests and we can
    see that even at 0 requests, BLOOM had an idle consumption of 0.3 KWh, and at
    1,000 requests the electricity consumption was less than 5 times higher than at
    200 requests.

    versus the number of requests received by the instance in a 10 minute interval

    instance in this time span (bottom left of the graph), the energy consumption
    remains at approximately 0.28 kWh.” (Figure and text by [2] p. 6)'

    state that *“since inference requests are unpredictable, optimization of GPU memory
    using techniques such as batching and padding […] is not possible”* ([2] p. 5),
    we might expect that ChatGPT experiences a constant rate of requests high enough
    to make batching feasible. I would guess that batching of queries would lead to
    a lower energy consumption per query.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although handling a single query requires miniscule resources, the total amount
    of resources (e.g. electricity) add up to noticeable amounts when a product like
    ChatGPT scales. The search engine Bing now has incorporated ChatGPT [5] which
    might significantly increase the number of queries ChatGPT should handle, thereby
    also increasing the electricity consumption. In my opinion, this requires a debate
    about whether the incorporation of large machine learning models into existing
    products elevate the user experience to a level that justifies the large energy
    consumption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, unless the estimates put forward here are way too high, this article
    shows that running a machine learning based product in production can easily be
    way more energy consuming than training the model — especially if the product
    has a long life time and/or a large number of users. This should be taken into
    consideration when debating the environmental impact of AI and when thinking of
    how to reduce the life cycle carbon footprint of machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important for me to emphasize that the estimates put forward in this article
    come with great uncertainties as very little information about how ChatGPT is
    run is publicly available. In the best of all worlds, OpenAI and Microsoft — and
    other tech companies for that matter — would disclose the energy consumption and
    carbon footprint of their products. But while we wait for that to happen, I hope
    my estimates will spur a debate and inspire others to come up with better estimates.
