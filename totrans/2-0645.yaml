    What types of data roles are employers hiring for and would make a good career
    right now? And even which specific companies are hiring at the very end. So, you’ll
    want to stay tuned for that.

- en: Data related to the data job market was very difficult to find. So, please bear
    with me. I did the best I could with what I could scrounge up from a couple of
    different resources. The first data I found on the job market was from an Interview
    Query blog, which I’ve linked in the references below. It only goes through March
    of this year, but it still helps to paint a decent year-over-year picture of the
    job market for data roles.

- en: From March 2022 to March 2023, we see that there’s a massive decrease in job
    postings (i.e., a roughly 90% reduction) from Big Tech companies known under the
    acronym FAANG (or MANGA). On the other hand, other companies have actually increased
    their hiring by a few percentage points (i.e., an approximately 7% improvement).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is about the same number of job postings available overall in the market
    as there were in the previous year. And that’s because non-FAANG companies make
    up a far larger proportion of total jobs (i.e., in the tens of thousands) than
    their FAANG counterparts (i.e., in the hundreds).

    market has completely fallen off a cliff since March.” This is where some great
    data that I got from Luke Barousse comes into play. Here’s his tool [datanerd.tech](https://datanerd.tech/)
    if you want to play with this data yourself.

    has changed since then. It looks like, since March, the job market really did
    take a dive until May, at least in the number of total job postings available
    in Luke’s data. On the other hand, now it looks like it’s starting to recover.

    engineers, data analysts, and data scientists.

    So, if you’re applying for a junior role and it seems saturated, it’s likely because
    the supply of entry-level talent is far greater than that of senior-level talent.
