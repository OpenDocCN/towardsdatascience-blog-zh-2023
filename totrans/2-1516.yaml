    and it’s susceptible to [prompt injections](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1598253337400717313).”
    RLHF-optimized models can also enter a loop of conflicting priorities. Alexander
    says that “punishing unhelpful answers will make the AI more likely to give false
    ones; punishing false answers will make the AI more likely to give offensive ones;
    and so on.” It may not be possible to make LMs generate helpful, truthful, and
    non-offensive responses at the same time.'

    another happy idea that may — or may not — work as well as RLHF.
