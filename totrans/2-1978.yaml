    the average tenure of a CDO is a mere 2.4 years. This eye-opening finding highlights
    the challenges faced by data leaders and underscores the importance of equipping
    them with the essential technical skills necessary for long-lasting success.

    should be, unfortunately, in the early days, the lack of technical skills sometimes
    creates a shortfall of knowledge leading to shorter tenures.
