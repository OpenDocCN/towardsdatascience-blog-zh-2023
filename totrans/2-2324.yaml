    the possibilities to manage our data privacy. Especially regarding these two new
    features that control fundamental points such as making sure your interactions
    with ChatGPT are not used for training purposes if you don‚Äôt want to, or explicitly
    receive the exact data a company has about you.
  prefs: []

    For example, users should be aware also of **data retention policies**. That is
    knowing how long the platform retains the data, which ideally should be the minimum
    necessary. Understanding the **intended use of the data** you provide to the AI
    platform and being informed **whether the platform shares your data with third
    parties and which is the purpose of the sharing** should be also part of our main
    concerns.
