    solely on Python or SQL. With the era of big data and cloud computing, new data-related
    open-source projects have been emerging than ever before. Not only do we have
    multiple options for your tasks, but too many of them that require data engineers
    to know the pros and cons of each tool to pick.'

    situation from my selections. A few years ago, I loved chasing down the latest
    and undiscovered data engineering tools. Many of those projects didn't become
    popular, and many of them needed to be updated. It's terrifying that you find
    an excellent project on GitHub; the following year, it is abandoned. That's the
    speed of a data engineering framework dying out if it doesn't get enough usage.

    data into insights to help your business. Even if you run the business with paper
    or Excel, data is inevitable for business success.

    fashion. It works well at first as a proof-of-concept project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, after the excitement of showing a new way to run the job in a streaming
    manner, I started to need help to productionize it. There needs to be a more robust
    use case for streaming, and people are still happy with the batch approaches.
    I tried to find and persuade others to convert batch to streaming, and it didn't
    go well. I also found migration is costly, 24/7 streaming support is a pain, and
    many bugs drain my time on such a new framework.

    The Extract and Loading are about the data's location and storage read/write efficiency.
    Transformation is the core part that applies business logic.

- en: Data engineering is needed as the middleman or center of the data. Although
    it often only starts when the event or log is generated, getting involved in data
    generation early is critical, making it much easier to read and less chaotic to
    consume.

    it usually marks the starting time for many data engineering projects.

    can land on time for the end users to derive value for helping businesses make

    tool to make the pipeline run 10% faster than building essential metrics that
    can drive a 1% revenue gain is less important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The remaining 30% of responsibility is to gain domain knowledge, understand
    how data is generated in the first place (not transformed and given to you by
    some team), learn the preference of end users on how to build metrics and dimensions
    and collaborate (data engineering isn't a sole role)

    you more efficiently improve your velocity. The core part of digging the business
    out of the massive data is unique and often hard to achieve by adding other tools.

- en: You can put the data to consume into tiers or serve in analytics-friendly storage
    like an OLAP query engine. The business's most critical metrics and dimensions
    should be allocated as a gold dataset for the most crucial business use case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We often discussed leveraging OLAP, columnar storage like parquet, and parallel
    processing. However, the schema, data model design, user-friendly naming, and
    data catalog must be evaluated more.

- en: Knowing many issues aren't simply by throwing more computing resources is a
    hard lesson. The first time adding more resources could work, but it will only
    sometimes be the case. Until then, a more fundamental issue has surfaced, is there
    anything with how the data has been queried or flaws in the design?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before adding wasteful resources and redundant work, rethink the data modeling
    design, interact with the users, and develop real use cases to evaluate if they
    are covered. This process must be addressed as data engineers are busy assessing
    and trying the available toolings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My experience is any popular tool can archive 90% of the requirements for data
    engineering tasks. We shouldn't spend 90% of the time chasing down the best and
    fast ones but leave 10% of the time focusing on the most critical things — serving
    the data to help business to derive insights.
