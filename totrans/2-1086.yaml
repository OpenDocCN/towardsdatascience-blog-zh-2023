    retrospective already. In this piece, I’ll explore how generative AI is impacting
    data governance, and where it’s likely to take us in the **near** future. Let
    me emphasize **near** because things evolve quickly, and they can go a lot of
    different ways. This article isn’t about forecasting the next 100 years of data
    governance, but rather a practical look at the changes happening now and those
    just on the horizon.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metadata and documentation is probably the most important part of data governance,
    and the other parts build heavily of this one being done properly. AI has already
    started, and will continue to change the way we create data context. But I dont
    want to get your hopes too high. We still need humans in the loop when it comes
    to documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Producing context around data, or documenting the data has two parts. The first
    element, which makes up about 70% of the job, involves documenting general information,
    common for many companies. A very basic example is the definition of “email” which
    is common to all companies. The second part is about writing down the specific
    know-how that’s unique to your company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s the exciting part: AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting for the first
    70%. It’s because the first element involves general knowledge, and generative
    AI is excellent at handling that.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, what about knowledge that’s peculiar to your company? Every organization
    is unique, and this uniqueness gives rise to your own specific company language.
    This language is your metrics, KPIs, and business definitions. And it isn’t something
    that can be imported from outside. It’s born from the people who know the business
    best = its employees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my conversations with data leaders, I often discuss how to create a shared
    understanding of these business concepts. Many leaders share that to achieve this
    alignment, they bring domain teams **in the same room** to talk, debate, and agree
    upon the definitions that best fit their business model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take, for example, the definition of a ‘customer.’ For a subscription-based
    business, a customer could be someone who’s currently subscribed to their service.
    But for a retail business, a customer might be anyone who’s made a purchase in
    the last 12 months. Each company defines ‘customer’ in a way that makes the most
    sense for them, and this understanding usually emerges from within the organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to such peculiar knowledge, AI, as smart as it is, can’t do this
    part just yet. It can’t sit in on your meetings, join in the discussion, or help
    new concepts bloom. For Andreessen Horowitz, this might become possible when the
    [second wave of AI](https://a16z.com/2023/03/30/b2b-generative-ai-synthai/) hits.
    For now, we are still at wave 1.

    bot can write data documentation on demand for us, [what’s the point of writing
    it down at all](https://rachsmith.com/i-want-good-search/#:~:text=If%20a%20bot%20can%20write%20for%20me%2C%20what%20is%20the%20point%20of%20me%20writing%20in%20the%20first%20place%3F)?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There is some truth to this: if generative AI can generate content on demand,
    why not just generate it when you need it, instead of bothering with documenting
    everything? Unfortunately, it does not work like this, for two reasons.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, as I’ve previously explained, a part of documentation covers the unique
    aspects of a company that AI **cannot capture yet**. This calls for human expertise.
    It cannot be generated on the fly by AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, while AI is advanced, it’s not infallible. The data it generates isn’t
    always accurate. You need to make sure a human checks and confirms all AI-produced
    content.
  prefs: []

- en: 2\. Search and Discovery
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generative AI is not just changing the way we create documentation but also
    how we consume it. In fact, we’re witnessing a paradigm shift in search and discovery
    methods. The traditional methods, where analysts search through your data catalog
    seeking out relevant information, are quickly becoming outdated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A true game changer lies in AI’s ability to become a **personal data assistant**
    to everyone in the company. In some data catalogs, you can already approach the
    AI with your specific data inquiries. You can ask questions such as, “Is it possible
    to perform action X with the data?”, “Why am I unable to use the data to achieve
    Y?”, or “Do we possess data that illustrates Z?”. If your data is enriched with
    the right context, AI will help disseminate this context across the whole company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another development we’re expecting is that AI will transform the data catalog
    from a passive entity to an active helper. Think about it this way: if you’re
    using a formula incorrectly, the AI assistant could give you a heads-up. Likewise,
    if you’re about to write a query that already exists, the AI could let you know
    and guide you to the existing piece of work.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, data catalogs just sat there, waiting for you to sift through them
    for answers. But with AI, catalogs could start actively helping you, offering
    insights and solutions **before you even realize you need them**. This would be
    complete shift in how we engage with data, and it might be happening very soon.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Yet, there is a condition for the AI assistant to work effectively: your data
    catalog must be maintained. To ensure that the AI assistant provides reliable
    guidance to stakeholders, the underlying documentation must be 100% trustworthy.
    If the catalog is not properly maintained, or if the policies are not clearly
    defined, then the AI assistant will spread incorrect information throughout the
    company. This would be more detrimental than having no information at all, as
    it could lead to poor decision-making based on the wrong context.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You’ve probably understood it: AI and data governance are interdependent. AI
    can enhance data governance, but in turn, robust data governance is required to
    fuel the capabilities of AI. This results in a virtuous cycle where each component
    boosts the other. But you need to keep in mind that **no element can replace the
    other.**'

- en: 3\. Data policies and standards
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key component of data governance is the formulation and implementation
    of governance rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This usually involves defining data ownership and domains within the organization.
    Right now, AI isn’t up to the task when it comes to defining these policies and
    standards. AI shines when it comes to executing rules or flagging infractions,
    but **it is lacking when tasked with creating the rules themselves.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is for a simple reason. Defining ownership and domains pertains to human
    politics. For example, ownership means deciding who within the organization has
    the authority over specific datasets. This could include the power to make decisions
    about how and when the data is used, who has access to it, and how it’s maintained
    and secured. Making these decisions often involves negotiating between individuals,
    teams, or departments, each with their own interests and perspectives. And human
    politic, for obvious reasons, cannot be replaced by AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We thus expect that humans will continue to play a significant role in this
    aspect of governance in the near future. Generative AI can play a role in drafting
    an ownership framework or suggesting data domains. However, keeping humans in
    the loop still remains a must.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Data Privacy and Security
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, generative AI is set to shake things up in the privacy department of
    governance. Managing privacy rights is a traditionally feared aspect of governance.
    Nobody enjoys it. It involves manually creating a complex architecture of permissions
    to make sure sensitive data is protected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The good news is: AI can automate much of this process. Given parameters such
    as the number of users and their respective roles, AI can create rules for access
    rights. The architectural aspect of access rights, being fundamentally code-based,
    aligns well with AI’s capabilities. The AI system can process these parameters,
    generate relevant code, and apply it to manage data access efficiently.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another area where AI can make a big impact is in the management of Personally
    Identifiable Information (PII). Today, PII tagging is usually done manually, making
    it a burden for the person in charge of it. This is something AI can automate
    completely. By leveraging AI’s pattern recognition capabilities, PII tagging can
    be conducted more accurately than when it’s done by a human. In this sense, using
    AI could actually improve the way we we manage privacy protection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This does not imply that AI will completely replace human involvement. Despite
    AI’s capabilities, we still need human oversight to manage unexpected situations
    and make judgment calls when needed.

- en: 5\. Data Quality
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s not forget about data quality, which is an important pillar of governance.
    Data quality ensures that the information used by a company is accurate, consistent,
    and reliable. Maintaining data quality has always been a complex endeavor, but
    things are already changing with generative AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I mentioned above, AI is great at applying rules and flagging infractions.
    This makes it easy for algorithms to identify anomalies in the data. You can find
    a detailed account on how AI affects different aspects of data quality in [this
    article](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-ai-improve-data-quality-consistency#:~:text=AI%20can%20use%20machine%20learning,currencies%20across%20different%20data%20sources).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI can also lower the technical barrier of data quality. This is something SODA
    is already putting in place. Their new tool, [**SodaGPT**](https://www.soda.io/resources/introducing-sodagpt),
    offers a no-code approach to express data quality checks, enabling users to perform
    quality checks using natural language alone. This allows data quality maintenance
    to become much more intuitive and accessible.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve seen that AI can supercharge Data Governance in a way that is triggering
    the beginning of a paradigm shift. A lot of changes are already happening, and
    they are here to stay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, AI can only build on a foundation **that’s already solid**. For AI
    to change the search and discovery experience in your company, you must already
    be maintaining your documentation. AI is powerful, but it can’t miraculously mend
    a system that is flawed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The second point to keep in mind is that even if AI can be used to generate
    most of the context around data, it cannot replace the human element entirely.
    we still need humans in the loop for validation and for documenting the knowledge
    unique to each company. So our one sentence prediction for the future of governance:
    turbocharged by AI, anchored in human discernment and cognition.'
