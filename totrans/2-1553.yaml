- en: When I first started as a data engineer, I worked on a DevOps-focused team.
    While it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to be doing in my first role, it taught
    me a lot. Now looking back, if I hadn’t worked in that type of role then, I probably
    wouldn’t have the experience I have as an analytics engineer today.

    While this may sound similar to DevOps, they are very different. DevOps focuses
    on software as the product while DataOps focuses on producing high-quality data.
    For those focusing on DataOps, data is the product!

- en: While working as a DevOps data engineer, I supported software engineers making
    code changes to our web application. I focused on testing changes in the UI after
    each deployment rather than looking into the specifics of the data. Not once did
    I check on the number of rows in a table or if values in a field were populated.
    Instead, I made sure no errors were being thrown on the backend.
  prefs: []

- en: As an analytics engineer, any time I make a code change or push something to
    production, I need to focus on the metadata—or the data about the data. This involves
    writing validation queries to ensure things like row count, column count, and
    distribution of values look as they did before I pushed a change. Or, if I want
    them to look different than they did before, they reflect those changes!

    In this article we will dive deeper into the differences, touching on the product
    they aim to serve and the varying metrics of success.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DevOps involves the deployment and testing of software code changes. When I
    worked as a DevOps engineer it often involved long deployment nights, testing
    code changes in many different environments, and validating the changes with the
    software engineers that made them.

- en: DevOps teams work to serve software engineers. They help to manage the environments
    where changes are occurring, ensuring downtime is minimized and platforms can
    scale accordingly. DevOps data engineers don’t write the code they are deploying
    but rather manage the infrastructure that supports the code.
  prefs: []

- en: I would often work with software engineers to determine when changes should
    be pushed, which environment they should be pushed to, and then to validate that
    our AWS resources could properly handle the changes. I never read over pull requests
    or checked how someone’s JavaScript was written. I instead made sure I chose the
    right cluster size and scaled cloud resources accordingly. It’s important to remember
    that DevOps specifically focuses on the deliverability of software code changes.
  prefs: []

- en: To ensure you can deliver as a DevOps team, you need to have processes in place
    like building CI/CD pipelines and using these to constantly reiterate. Without
    proper testing before pushing something to production, deliverability often fails.
    To prevent breaking code it is critical to proactively test how code manifests
    in a new environment.

- en: DevOps teams use downtime as their core measure of success. This was what we
    checked religiously on my team to see how we were doing compared to previous months,
    or other teams. If our downtime was increasing, we knew there was something that
    needed to be changed. It was also a great indicator that the improvements in our
    systems were working.

- en: If you’ve done your job well, downtime is often limited because everything in
    the deployment process went smoothly. It signifies that you were properly prepared
    and knew how to fix potential problems that came your way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if the downtime is long, it’s a good indicator that something went
    wrong in the deployment process or the system couldn’t scale accordingly with
    the changes. This is critical in DevOps because customers are typically the ones
    affected by downtime. This is why you typically see SEV 1 and SEV 2 incidents
    caused by DevOps teams. These are considered critical because they are preventing
    customers from using your product.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DataOps treats data as the product. There isn’t a core software feature it supports
    but rather it focuses on high-quality metadata. As an analytics engineer, I focus
    on DataOps every day. If I don’t produce data that is fresh, accurate, and reliable
    then what is the point?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DataOps is a core part of any data role. Unlike DevOps, it’s not a separate
    team that overlooks changes, but rather something every data practitioner must
    perform. Analytics engineers and data engineers are expected to validate the data
    models they use in their models and the data their models produce. Many, like
    myself, do their own testing and then monitor those tests to ensure everything
    is going smoothly. There isn’t a separate team to quality-check how the new data
    is integrating into the already existing data environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With DataOps, there isn’t necessarily a deployment schedule or process, because
    it’s ongoing. Analytics and data engineers are expected to constantly monitor
    databases, data warehouses, and any other systems that generate data. Instead
    of a rigid process, it’s about continuously making changes and ensuring you test
    and monitor along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, like DevOps, DataOps may also involve building out features like CI/CD
    pipelines in order to make code changes easier and more reliable. DataOps can
    also involve setting up different environments to test how changes to source data
    or data models affect data downstream.

- en: Because DataOps is focused on data quality, key metrics of success include freshness,
    how close the computed values compare to actual values, and how often the data
    is available when it is needed. The same metrics that are emphasized in observability
    are considered metrics of success in DataOps.

- en: At the end of the day, the data that is being produced needs to be used by the
    business. If the business can’t use the data it needs to make decisions, DataOps
    isn’t being done well. Its purpose is to guide the business in the direction it
    needs to succeed and make the most revenue. High-quality data will help you do
    that, but low-quality data will do quite the opposite.

- en: While DevOps and DataOps are different in the products they serve and the metrics
    they measure, at the end of the day, both are in place to serve the end user and
    give them the best experience possible. For DevOps, this is a customer. For DataOps,
    this is a business stakeholder.

- en: Both DevOps and DataOps focus on the health of their products and gain insights
    into the possible things that can go wrong. They try to prevent any negative impacts
    on customers or stakeholders by properly testing the changes they make before
    they make them. At the core, they exist to minimize the number of problems that
    a business faces.

    different, both of my teams sat at the center of their organization. Their goal
    is to serve others and ensure changes go smoothly. They share common best practices
    such as enforcing strict data governance within an organization, using version
    control, and implementing CI/CD. At their core, DevOps and DataOps are service-centered
    disciplines that many companies would be very lost without.

    about the type of product you want to work on. Are you interested in software
    or data engineering? If you lean more towards data engineering, you may want to
    look into DataOps.

    in the middle of the night. If you’re someone who values they’re early bedtime
    and sleep, this may not be the role for you.
