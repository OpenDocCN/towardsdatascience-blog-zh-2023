    variety or diversity often takes the form of dispersion.

    we wouldn’t have found otherwise. Typically, we use the following as measures
    of dispersion: variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (IQR).
    However, we may need to examine dataset dispersion beyond these typical measures
    in some cases.'

- en: Whether we’re measuring people’s heights or housing prices, we seldom find all
    data points to be the same. We won’t expect everyone to be the same. Some people
    are tall, average, or short. The data generally varies. In order to study this
    data variability or dispersion, we usually quantify it using measures like range,
    variance, standard deviation, *etc*. The measures of dispersion quantify how spread
    out our data points are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    what if we want to compare the sales prices of a jewelry shop and a bookstore?
    Standard deviation won’t work here, as the scales of the two datasets are likely
    very different.

    also known as the *relative standard deviation*, is a standardized measure of
    dispersion. It’s expressed as a percentage and doesn’t have units. As a result,
    CV is an excellent measure of variability for comparing data on different scales.

    is another measure of *relative* dispersion, especially useful when dealing with
    skewed data or even data with outliers. The QCD focuses on the spread of the middle
    50% of a dataset, *i.e.*, the interquartile range (IQR). That’s why QCD is a robust
    measure.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why not focus on measures like standard deviation or IQR?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use standard deviation and IQR to quantify dispersion in datasets. The standard
    deviation shows the average distance between data points from the mean. The IQR
    shows the distribution of the middle 50% of our data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these measures may be deceptive when comparing the dispersion of two
    or more datasets with different units or scales, skewed distributions, or the
    presence of outliers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While standard deviation and IQR are useful statistical tools, we occasionally
    require CV and QCD to conduct fair comparisons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CV and QCD both measure and compare variability, although they do so in
    somewhat different ways. Your data and desired variability determine which one
    to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When to use CV
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CV is a good way to compare the amount of variation in different datasets that
    have different sizes, units, or average values. Because the CV is a relative measure
    of spread, it shows how different things are from the mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mean and standard deviation, two measures that are greatly affected by “outliers,”
    are used to create the CV. So, the CV can give a distorted view of spread in datasets
    that aren’t normally distributed or have outliers. Thus, CV works best with data
    that is evenly spread out and doesn’t have extreme values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the sales case, the price ranges for the two groups were very different,
    so the scales used to measure their sales were also very different. The jewelry
    store is likely to have much higher average sales and much more variation. If
    we used the standard deviation to measure how variable these two groups are, we
    might come to the wrong conclusion that the jewelry shop’s sales are more variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CV allowed us to compare the variability of sales between the two datasets,
    regardless of their different scales. If the CV is higher for one category, it
    means that the sales are more variable relative to the average sales for that
    category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When to use QCD
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The QCD uses dataset quartiles, which are less outlier-sensitive. QCD is a robust
    dispersion measure for skewed distributions or datasets containing outliers. The
    QCD concentrates on the center 50% of the data, which may better capture dispersion
    in such datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In our example, we examined the age differences between two companies: a startup
    company (A) with mostly younger employees and a well-established company (B) with
    mostly elderly employees. Given their distinct age ranges, the median age and
    variability would be higher for the older company. Using the Interquartile Range
    (IQR) to compare dispersion might inaccurately suggest higher age variance in
    the established company, as the IQR measures absolute variability and is higher
    for larger values.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The QCD is more effective as it standardizes variability against the median,
    enabling us to compare age variability between companies on different scales.
    A higher QCD indicates greater age variance relative to the median for that company.
    Therefore, the QCD was chosen for this comparison as it accounts for different
    scales and potential data skews or outliers.

    Dispersion (QCD) are crucial statistics for examining dispersion in numerical
    data. CV excels at comparing scaled data, while QCD helps in cases of skewed or
    outlier datasets. We looked at two cases (with Python programs and analysis) to
    see how this works in practice. By using them wisely, we may get useful information
    for making decisions.
