    sweeteners. It’s an economical alternative to authentic chocolate, due to its
    less expensive ingredients. You can find it in budget-friendly chocolate bars
    or candy coating. This type of chocolate holds a particular memory for many people
    in Poland, the country I live in. During the 1980s, it replaced authentic chocolate
    owing to shortages of essential ingredients.

    Learner’s Dictionary defines it as ‘*an* ***understanding*** *of what something
    is like*’. Dictionary.com describes it as ‘*apprehending the true nature of a
    thing, especially through intuitive* ***understanding***.’ Lastly, the Cambridge

    truly like*.’

    of competitive advantage. However, a surprisingly small fraction of companies
    harnesses its full potential. **Merely 27% of companies view themselves as data-driven
    [3]**. When envisioning businesses that truly leverage and derive value from data,
    the usual suspects come to mind: online giants like Amazon, Meta, and Netflix.
    Yet, the truth is, organizations of any size and across all sectors can fuel their
    growth through the efficient use of data.'

    specific business needs, its true value emerges only when applied effectively.
    This means decisions and subsequent actions must be grounded in the trends, nuances,

    Luckily, there are tools in place that help companies navigate through this process.
    Consider the **Insight Value Chain Mode**l proposed by McKinsey [4]. This conceptual
    framework guides organizations in transforming raw data into actionable insights,
    thereby generating business value. The model shows four main steps that explain
    how data goes from being raw to making valuable decisions. In the picture below,
    I use an example of a retail company trying to boost its sales to show how this
    model works.

    extraneous elements like frames, support lines, and unnecessary data points, which
    can distract from the main message. Think of color and text as strategic tools
    in your arsenal; they should be used to emphasize and highlight key information,
    not just to beautify the chart.

    attention with unnecessary and extensive suspense. Evaluate your storytelling
    using methods like the 3-minute story or the Big Idea [7]. **For instance, I vocalize
    my narratives, be it articles or presentations. If I can articulate the story
    smoothly, it boosts my confidence in its resonance with the audience.** Once you’ve
    won their attention, introduce key conclusions and call to action. Be sure to
    do that right after the story’s climax — that’s when they’re most engaged and
    receptive. However, if reservations arise, prioritize active listening. Address
    any uncertainties, and if needed, **suggest collaborative follow-up activities
