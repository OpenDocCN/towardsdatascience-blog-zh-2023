  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pose tracking is the process of detecting and tracking the movement of a person’s
    body in real-time using computer vision technology. It involves using algorithms
    to capture and interpret the movement of various body parts, such as the arms,
    legs, and torso.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technique can be relevant for analyzing body movement in sports, as it
    allows coaches and athletes to identify and correct movement patterns that may
    be negatively impacting performance or causing injuries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By providing real-time feedback, athletes can make adjustments to their technique,
    leading to improved performance and reduced risk of injury. Additionally, this
    technology can be used to compare movements to those of top performers in the
    sport for example, to help beginners identify areas for improvement and refine
    their technique accordingly.

    United States.

    stronger opponent by using leverage and technique. Practitioners aim to control
    their opponent’s body and position themselves in a dominant position where they
    can execute techniques such as chokes, joint locks, and throws.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The large emphasis on technique makes this martial art quite unique, and in
    the context of a jiu jitsu gym, it is usually the role of the black belt coach
    to give feedback to the student regarding the appropriateness of his or her execution
    of different techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it’s often the case that people want to learn but either don’t have
    the access to an expert, or the class contains too many students and it becomes
    difficult for the person conducting the class to give specific and personal feedback
    regarding whether or not the student is performing the movements correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within this gap of feedback is that I think tools like pose tracking can greatly
    benefit the world of martial arts in general and Jiu Jitsu in particular (although
    one can argue the same for Judo, wrestling, and striking-based martial arts as
    well), because they could be seamlessly integrated into a smartphone only requiring
    athletes to film themselves while performing the movement they are trying to improve.
  prefs: []

    this article is an attempt to provide directions for how such a machine learning

    play from the bottom using your “guard” (a reference to the usage of the legs
    to perform attacks on the opponent) or from the top by first taking down your
    opponent and then proceeding to pass the line of their legs to (usually) reach
    a dominant position like being mounted on your opponent or taking his/her back.'

    which can only be explained by the fact that some of the tracings obtained referred
    to the foot coming down rather than up while executing the movement.

    seemed to improve a bit and at least stay consistent at 20 (which in this case
    is the measure of the Euclidean distance between the two sequences).

    quite insightful that an approach like this could be converted into a measurable
    metric that compares the quality of a movement with respect to another.

    to the power of this technique to give a granular assessment of movement, despite
    the fact that it would still need a lot of work in order to become a useful tool
    for insight.
