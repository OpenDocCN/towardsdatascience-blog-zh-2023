    of data generated in any enterprise is enormous, and making timely executive decisions
    relies on having all the relevant data and most current analysis available at
    your fingertips. In many organisations, this critical task of data presentation
    is done through the use of automated dashboards, such as with Power BI or Tableau.
    Provided the source data is updated regularly, these visualisation tools will
    automatically generate the required graphs and plots for whatever metrics need
    tracking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dashboards are an example of an *integrated narrative* approach to data visualisation
    — the user is encouraged to explore the data for themselves, and gather insights
    for their own purposes. These types of visualisations allow viewers to study the
    data and discover key insights on their own. Business intelligence applications
    like Power BI and Tableau are prime examples of this form of storytelling, where
    interactive dashboards allow the viewer to dive into the data with minimal guidance.

    I created using Tableau Public. Tableau Public is a free service for anyone who
    wants to create their own interactive dashboards — with the caveat that all visualisations
    generated are publicly accessible (a licensed version of the application is also
    available, which would be more suitable for confidential data). I’ve included
    links to all the dashboards I’ve generated here if you’d like to explore the data
    in your own time.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first dashboard I’ve prepared displays metrics of various salaries across
    different experience levels, education levels, and job fields. These salaries
    were taken from a small subset of users on Glassdoor — the original dataset can
    be found [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data)on
    Kaggle. This kind of dashboard would be especially useful for job seekers and
    HR workers alike, as it gives a quick insight into the kind of salary ranges and
    demographics seen in the jobs market. To explore the data in this dashboard, you
    can view it [**here**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.lenehan/viz/SalaryAnalysisDashboard_16995718437200/SalaryDashboard).

    individuals with doctorates, I can select the PhD bucket on the box plot and the
    other visuals adjust for the filtered data.

- en: The overall survey is rightly skewed in terms of experience level, with the
    most common respondents having 2–3 years of experience. This may introduce bias
    in any decisions based on this dashboard — ideally a more proportionate survey
    should be taken for a better analysis (thankfully all visuals update immediately
    once additional responses are collected in the source file).
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unsurprisingly, research positions are dominated by those with PhDs — though
    we also see a large portion of doctorates working in web/software development,
    and in sales/marketing. It also appears that there’s a heavy gender imbalance
    in the PhD respondents, with far less women in this bucket than men.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next visualisation I created was a dashboard showing eviction trends in
    the New York municipal area, across the city’s five Boroughs. The original dataset
    was sourced from the New York City Open Data Portal, which can be found [**here**](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4).
    This dashboard would be particularly useful for those working in the municipal
    government or a non-profit, looking to reduce eviction trends across the city
    for example — you can follow the link [**here**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.lenehan/viz/NEwYorkCityEvictionsAnalysis/NYEvictionAnalysis)to
    explore the visuals in this dashboard.

    recorded in New York City over the last 6 years, bar plots of evictions per Borough
    (which can also be expanded to show evictions at the district or neighbourhood
    level), a line graph showing historical eviction trends by Borough, and a list
    of neighbourhoods ordered by the most affected. A slider at the top of the dashboard
    makes it possible to choose a range of dates for analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    below I’ve filtered the visual to only look at Bronx evictions in 2019\. Much
    like my earlier example, all other visuals adjust for the filtered data — for
    example, note how the map now only includes the Bronx Borough.

    time period for this report, followed by Brooklyn and Queens.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There was a clear drop-off in evictions between 2021 and 2022, apparently due
    to a moratorium on evictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The eviction rate in the Bronx for 2019 appears to decrease steadily with time,
    which is consistent with the trends of the other Boroughs during this period.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once again, these examples represent only a small subset of the possible observations
    that could be taken from the evictions dashboard. Delving deeper into the dashboard
    could unveil additional insights, which would ultimately support more informed
    decision-making around eviction resources.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last dashboard I want to talk through is a dashboard of Spanish tourism
    trends across all provinces and autonomous regions, from 2018 to 2021\. The data
    for this visualisation was taken from the Spanish government’s open data portal,
    which can be found [**here**](https://datos.gob.es/en/catalogo/ea0010587-pernoctaciones-por-residencia-del-viajero-provincias-oat-identificador-api-48427)(unfortunately,
    the Spanish government has not made data available for 2022 or 2023). This has
    clear business and governmental applications — for example, someone in Spain’s
    tourism department may use this data to decide where to spend money on developing
    regional tourism. Similarly, a business may use this data to predict which regions
    will see the most tourism in a given year. The dashboard can be found at the link
    [**here**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.lenehan/viz/SpanishTourismTrends2018-2021/SpanishTourismTrends)for
    anyone who wants to explore the data.

    by province and year, and a map of all the provinces in Spain.

    shows the tourism details for that province, with a bar chart showing the proportion
    of Spanish nationals to international tourists during this period.

    regions in Spain by a wide margin.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: International tourism far outpaced domestic tourism for the years 2018 and 2019
    — for 2020 and 2021 the split was roughly equal, most likely as a result of travel
    restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tourism to Barcelona province represents over half of the overall tourism to
    Catalonia, and almost 2.5 times more than the next most popular province in the
    region (Girona). This is almost certainly due in large part to the city of Barcelona.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar analysis and observations can be made of other regions and provinces
    in Spain, to get a more informed sense of how much tourism can be expected in
    those parts of the country.

- en: To summarise, Tableau is a powerful tool for data visualization, allowing users
    to create concise and impactful visualisations across a wide variety of datasets.
    I’ve walked through three relatively simple visualisations I recently created
    in this article, but many other examples can be found on Tableau Public. Many
    of the visuals which can be found on Tableau are highly intuitive representations
    of incredibly complex topics, which speaks to the power of these dashboards in
    visualising these data. The value in these analytical tools lies not only in their
    ability to generate timely graphs and visuals at speed, but in allowing the data
    to be presented in clear and intelligent formats, leading to faster analysis and
    decision making.
