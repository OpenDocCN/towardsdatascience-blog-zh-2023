    manage your expectations properly if you hope to sustain that excitement.

    There’s endless content on the difference between roles and the above is a gross

  prefs: []

    problem as the handoff between these roles can often be disastrous. But even if
    everything goes smoothly, all of these roles don’t exist at all companies. Startups
    often have data professionals doing at least a little of everything and large
    organizations often have at least one of each role and mid-size organizations
    have all the flavors in between.

    then ask them to learn enough ML work to do the portions past their function (or
    Machine Learning Engineers and then ask them to learn enough DE to do the portions
    before their function). Other organizations think they want Data Scientists but
    need Data Analysts [first]. Other organizations have all of the roles but the
    differentiation of work isn’t clear enough making communication between teams
    really difficult.

    looks like which can be heavily influenced by the perspectives of the Leads, Management,
    and Executive team. The ambiguity is what causes confusion in the variety of job
    postings or the misalignment in the needs of the organization and what you may
    want to do.

- en: If you’re applying for a role, I’d recommend having questions ready to interview
    the data team you’re trying to join. Analyzing their culture is a key part of
    the interview so you know what culture you will be joining and how they value
    data functions. Asking questions like what an average day of the role looks like
    and what excellent would look like can give a great idea of what the job is like
    past the job description.
  prefs: []

- en: Furthermore, pay very close attention to how they conduct the technical interview.
    Everything from what they ask of you (Leetcode questions, take-home assessment,
    pair programming, etc.) to how they evaluate your work is a gold mine of information
    on how data is perceived at the organization. Personally, I think quizzing on
    arbitrary Leetcode algorithms is a waste of time and tells me enough of the data
    culture that I usually turn down the interviews there. It has nothing to do with
    my ability to complete the task, it has everything to do with the reality of the
    job looking nothing like that and their inability to see it differently than software
    engineering. Take-home tests can show a great understanding that data work is
    heavily contextually dependent (while still assessing technical ability) and success
    should be measured with an ability to handle uncertainty. This also can be awfully
    done where the evaluation of the tests is poor which also prompts me to turn down
    companies pretty quickly. How I evaluate data interviews deserves a story on its
    own, but that’s a brief guide on how I personally approach interviews and I recommend
    you create a strategy that reflects the culture you want to be a part of.
  prefs: []

- en: If you’re already at a company, the recommendation I have is to adapt to the
    definition that your company persists. You’d be much better served to be a Data
    Engineer who has ML skills in an organization that strongly values that function
    over obsessing on having the Data Scientist title. We’re all doing our part to
    row the boat and anyone who tries to impose a hierarchy of importance between
    arbitrary titles is playing a losing game. Create value from data to guide effective
    decision-making, regardless of your title.
  prefs: []

    be fairly compensated for your efforts and skills regardless of title. If you’re
    a Data Analyst but performing the duties of the Data Engineer and Data Analyst,
    the pay should be appropriate. I’m advocating more for how you should be adaptable
    in framing yourself to be more successful and happy at your company.

    tools popping up, your ability is more-so measured on being able to solve technical
    data problems regardless of the scenario you’re in. This could mean with Cloud
    or not, with Data Viz tools or not, with Python or not, etc. There are standards
    that we see throughout the industry that the majority have adopted but they can
    still vary enough due to the wide range of tools and technologies available. So
    far, all high-performing data organizations I’ve seen have been very strong with
    programming and also have the ability to learn tools as they need them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One similar pattern I’ve seen in every single data infrastructure is the use
    of SQL and lots of it. SQL is the cat with 9 lives; it keeps coming again and
    again in various shapes and forms no matter where you look. SQL education gets
    underplayed a lot, but it is a significant part of the job. Being able to write
    optimized SQL queries and front load your dataset curation is very much in your
    favor when dealing with large-scale projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difficulty of SQL writing can vary from project to project but it’s important
    to expect lots of SQL use and even opt for it whenever you can. Your project's
    workflows will be faster and easier to debug. The issue with this isn’t as much
    that it’s a “problem” to do as much SQL as possible but more that it is not discussed
    nearly enough leading to aspiring Data Scientists not being ready. Learning SQL
    is not hard, but practicing SQL can be. Now there are some really solid free sites
    out there to practice but they’re all simulated, contrived environments with small/easy
    tables. Organizations can have a really messy data landscape where people may
    not even know where the data you’re looking for exists and how it connects to
    other data.

- en: Try to incorporate SQL work in your personal projects. The need for personal
    projects in this space is undeniable but a lot of them typically start with a
    pd.read_csv() from a small csv file from Kaggle. This is fine, but it won’t help
    you properly practice and train for the actual job. Try to simulate a real-world
    scenario by loading the data into a small, open-source database and then querying
    it to get what you need. The amount you’ll learn in this exercise is incredible
    but if that’s overkill then you can even use pysql to practice in a better scenario
    than free sites.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to solve challenges with it. Getting used to the language and thinking through
    how data can be retrieved and combined and manipulated via SQL can be immensely
    useful for the job.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it is generally known that the job involves communication skills, there
    is a lot of depth to this skill that doesn’t get discussed. A [very] common scenario
    is that you’ve built a complex statistical model or machine learning system and
    regardless of whether it performs well or not you have < 30 minutes to explain
    to a senior executive the results. In that time, you need to provide just enough
    technical details without inundating them with too much information that the point
    gets lost while also providing recommendations of what can be done next and wrapping
    it in a business context that matters to them. This is hard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s no great way around this issue as not everyone can go through the time
    and effort needed to learn the intricacies of the data science world so you have
    to do the extra work to meet them where they’re at. This is not the same as obfuscating
    important points or “dumbing down” the content, it’s carefully providing enough
    information concisely and clearly in a way that is understood by your audience
    in a timely fashion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve seen this done best when you have a good team around you. Having one person
    discuss technical details while another can zoom out and provide a clear picture
    of the forest usually is the best scenario. I’ve seen many use cases where rambling
    happens from highly technical people believing they’re very strong communicators
    but in the end losing the audience they’re communicating to. Tread carefully with
    letting these people lead the conversations; too much information where a discussion
    is being hijacked by one person is as ineffective as too little information where
    nothing is said.

- en: Be honest with yourself about your communication strengths and weaknesses. It
    helps no one to assume yourself an expert because you know the technical details.
    Ask for brutally honest feedback from your peers on how discussions go with you
    involved and where you can improve. Once you properly can identify your weaknesses,
    look to how you can work with your team to cover the areas you’re not as effective
    in but they may be. Having a collaborative discussion as a team is usually really
    successful in resonating with an audience because one person can focus on just
    the right technical details while the other can focus on the broader picture that
    the details relate to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taking courses on this topic is fine, but the field needs more people who are
    willing to admit weaknesses here and learn on the job. It’s really best learned
    with practice and each person on the team should be willing to improve. It’s challenging
    to openly admit mistakes or call people out on their weaknesses but a data culture
    that empowers people to grow into the best versions of themselves is the one that
    will last over time.

    case that there’s a PM onboard to guide what needs to get done and when. This
    can work well or not, but it works best if the PM has training in managing advanced
    data initiatives. If not, this work gets communicated by the PM but it ends up
    being done by the Senior Data professionals.
  prefs: []

    effectively. Knowing how to prioritize the right next steps is a deeply crucial
    skill to learn. This requires a tenacious balance between cost, effort, and value
    which should evolve with the project as new information is discovered.

    when you’re having to do it at a low-level feature implementation for a data product.
    This is because it requires a deep understanding of what a certain iteration would
    require and how difficult it may be to implement. Data Products are inherently
    very iterative and an ability to appropriately estimate what it takes and what
    value is yielded is done best by those who can build it.

    you get with real-world projects, the better your intuition becomes about difficulty.
    The more diverse of tools and concepts you immerse yourself in, the better your
    estimate becomes about cost. And the more connected you become to the business,
    the better your alignment to high-value work. How you prioritize work based on
    these three factors can vary on your team, department, and company but being able
    to understand your scenario and how to navigate it will immediately differentiate
    you from others.
