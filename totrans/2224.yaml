    supply chain management. In the field of AI and data science, it is used in various
    applications such as ETA (estimated time to arrival), or fleet optimization.

- en: In the blog, I will go through the top techniques to visualize a route. In order
    to illustrate the blog, I will take the example of taxi data in the city of Porto.
    The taxi has IoT devices that emit the location of the taxi every 15 seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For illustration purposes, I will take data related to one taxi trip. The data
    has the taxi location and speed at each location.

    the path or the trajectory.

- en: It is a simple, but very effective technique, to visualize the route taken by
    the taxi, which is between Palacio de Bolso and HF Tuela Porto. You can also additionally
    observe that half of the route is along the Douro river, and half of the route
    is inside the city.

    visual plot with lots of insights!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us make our analysis fancier by using a heatmap. Shown here is the same
    route, but with red and green spots. The red spots indicates that there are more
    location points in the data compared to green spots.

- en: We can observe the places where there is more number of locations points. As
    the IoT sensors are emitting data every 15 seconds, this means that the taxi is
    at a stop or going slow. With further analysis , we can conclude that that the
    taxi is at a stop at the start and end points, as well as going slow at a point
    which is a turn.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us now make the route analysis more intelligent by combining it with data
    analysis. There is a speed column in the data, which is desperately waiting to
    be analyzed! Let us do some justice to the column.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the efficient ways to analyze additional data is to use markers. Shown
    below is the route with markers, which indicate the point of maximum speed.

    One interesting analysis you can do is outlier analysis. Shown here is the route
    with markers indicating outliers on the higher side.

    the outliers on the higher side are useful.

    Here you saw an example of speed, but you can introduce markers on various other
    data, such as acceleration, or any other vehicle sensor data.
