    data management. Simplistically, these principles treat data as a first class
    product with clear ownership, accountabilities, supported by a self-serve platform
    and federated governance. Lots has been written about this [here](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Mesh-Delivering-Data-Driven-Value/dp/1492092398/),

    that is worth discussing. Simply put, the promise of Data Mesh is that it enables
    federation of data and federation of data management, which fosters local autonomy,
    which drives the speed, agility, and innovation required in today’s fast changing

    stretched to far) to the flowers. It is crucial to nurture the most promising
    and valuable data products, while also allowing for the natural process of selection
    to take place — and allow learning of what works, and what does not — to take
    place. Yes, poorly constructed data products will not be used, will lose funding,

    however, must also ensure that it is easy for data producers to create, certify,
    and govern data products in the registry. To make data trustworthy, data product
    consumers (and producers) must be able to provide feedback to data product owners.
    And to use the modern vernacular, they should be able to “like”, “up-vote”, or
    “star” data products. This “crowdsourcing” model has worked exceedingly well in
    software (GitHub “stars”) and social media (Facebook “likes”) and provide to data
    product owners a macro level view of data product quality and trustworthiness
    while providing invaluable information to data product owners. It almost goes
    without saying that the role of the “enterprise” is to provide the tools and utilities
    to make is easy to provide feedback.'
