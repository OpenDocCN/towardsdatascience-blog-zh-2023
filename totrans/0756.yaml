    to its answers. There is no guarantee that it would answer one prompt the same
    way when asked many times. To account for this, I asked GPT-3 to answer each question
    several times to capture differences in responses. By doing this, I determined

    oscillated more on.

- en: One reason to explain the general social progressiveness of GPT-3’s outputs
    may stem from OpenAI’s efforts to [align GPT-3 using human feedback](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/).
    In a climate of huge [political divisiveness and polarization in the United States](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/),
    it seems unlikely that GPT-3’s generations are meant to reflect the opinions of
    the general American public. Rather, GPT-3’s outputs seem to represent a progressive
    and liberal subset of American values, which also happen to align with the more
    [socially progressive political opinions often found in the tech world](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/silicon-valley-politics.html).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT were fine-tuned using [Reinforcement Learning from
    Human Feedback](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf), which means that the model
    outputs were influenced by the decisions of human annotators. One hypothesis is
    that GPT-3’s outputs reflect the values and opinions of the human annotators who
    provided feedback used for the reinforcement learning. There is currently little
    information about who the annotators were and what kind of (political, social,
    economic, work, etc.) background they had. However, it is likely that OpenAI (and
    possibly others from the AI safety research community) trained the annotators
    before they began their work. This implies that it is possible that GPT-3’s outputs
    reflect an amalgamation of political values and opinions coming from both the
    annotators and the staff that trained them.

    why it answered a certain way. I was especially curious to dig deeper into the
    questions for which GPT-3 did not answer consistently — the lack of consensus

    topics. While GPT-3 was consistent in its narrative for the most part, there were
    a few scenarios where, with repeated prompting of the same question, it gave answers

    the establishment show that GPT-3 does not respond consistently for all topics.
    In fact, given these sorts of controversial and timely topics, which currently
    plague and divide the American consciousness, it is no surprise that GPT-3 is
    also equally divided. Since GPT-3 was trained on Terabytes of blog posts, opinion
    pieces, and social media threads from the Internet, this inconsistency in answering
    controversial topics may stem from the variety of opinions it encountered during
    its training.
  prefs: []

    but not on the topics mentioned in the earlier section (abortion, sexual freedom),
    which are also controversial topics within American society. There is no good
    answer to why this is the case (and also if this will continue to be the case,
    as OpenAI continues to fine-tune and train the next version of GPT). Perhaps the
    diversity of opinions around these polarizing topics reflect those for which even
    the human annotators weren’t able to agree on, either.

    to measure agreement among different raters for a given prompt. The score ranges
    from 1 to -1, where a score of 1 means each round of GPT-3 answered exactly the
    same each time, 0 means random, and -1 meant systematically disagreeing.

    (e.g. “agreed” with itself) a large part of the time, it did have moments of disagreement
    with itself. This supports the qualitative analyses above, in which GPT-3 replied
    consistently on most questions but for a select few controversial topics.
