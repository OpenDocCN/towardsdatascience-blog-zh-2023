    came from university projects. At the same time, I thought I was a great writer!
    Now looking back, I cringe at some of my earlier articles.

    **communication skills**. Ultimately, it has made me a better data scientist.
    I want to share my experience and discuss some specific benefits. This includes
    writing readable code and providing the first step to writing about difficult
    topics.

    At the same time, we work in fields that are constantly changing. This means we
    need to keep up with the latest tools. This can be difficult and time-consuming
    so it takes a real commitment to learn continuously.

    a deep knowledge on those topics.

- en: Writing has been a great motivator. Not only can I learn new things but I can
    share those lessons with the world. It is addictive — having people read and interact
    with your work. The desire to consistently post new articles has pushed me to
    consistently learn new things.

    after I’ve tried to explain something that I’ve realised I don’t actually understand
    it. On top of this, I always aim to add value to a topic. Introducing novelty
    requires a good understanding. In this way, writing has been a check on my knowledge.
    It has pushed me to truly understand the technical concepts I write about.

- en: A related skill is writing readable code. Good code should explain itself. Similarly,
    a tutorial based on readable code is easier to write. I spend less time explaining
    what the code does and often you don't have to explain it at all. I’ve found this
    benefit extends to collaborating in industry.

    Image Regression Model](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/using-shap-to-debug-a-pytorch-image-regression-model-4b562ddef30d).
    In the tutorial, I worked with SHAP values given in a 5-dimensional array. I wanted
    to visualise this array using one of the package''s functions. To do this, the
    array first needed to be reordered. Originally, the code looked like this:'

    the code transposed the array’s 3rd dimension with the 5th dimension. I found
    myself writing a lengthy paragraph about how the code was doing this. So, instead,
    I rewrote the code:'

    When writing code for tutorials, I am always looking out for examples like these.
    Readable code makes the writing process smoother and the tutorial more digestible.

- en: I’ve found this skill particularly useful when collaborating with other professionals.
    You can never get away from handovers and code reviews. Explaining code during
    these processes is no different to explaining it in an online tutorial. Ultimately,
    writing readable code means I’ve spent less time explaining that code to colleagues.

    also critical. You not only need to get results but also explain them and your
    process. I had to produce emails, presentations or technical documents on a daily
    basis. There was no getting away from writing!

    are more technical, others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist

- en: Writing coding tutorials is great practice for this. The more I wrote the better
    I was at communicating at work. Complex analysis became easier to explain and
    I had to clarify my work less. I quickly saw the tangible benefits. Yet, this
    was just the start.

    deep thoughts or nuanced arguments. You just explain the code. This means they
    can be a way to get into more difficult writing.

    take my first steps. I started to experiment by adding catchy stories to the instructions
    and conclusions. Stumbling through these helped me to move into different types
    of articles.
  prefs: []

    a data scientist. These were articles based on more abstract concepts, my personal
    experience and feelings. I found these far harder to write than any coding tutorial.
    Yet, I would not be at this point if not for those first tutorials.

    improved my technical knowledge and learned to write readable code. Writing tutorials
    has also brought me to the point where I feel confident to write about nearly
    anything. I haven’t even mentioned the benefits for my reputation and the financial
    compensation.
