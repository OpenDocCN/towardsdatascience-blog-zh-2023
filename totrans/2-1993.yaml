    and Plugins to all ChatGPT Plus users. I thought it might be a good time to delve
    into some of the plugins I find useful and discuss their use cases in web browsing,
    summarizing, coding, and more.

    expecting a full report. That was definitely a pleasant surprise. I also found
    more [examples](https://app.noteable.io/p/efa0bae2-e7e2-49b1-8b10-6c73aff0bfa5/ChatGPT-Plugin-Examples)
    with more complicated use cases including various modeling and various styles
    of visualizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ❎ It took a little longer than I thought on each run and I get different results
    every time. I wish it could be faster and generate more consistent results. But
    that’s not actually an issue with Noteable, it’s more of an issue of using the
    OpenAI models. Everything generated is probabilistic, there is no guarantee to
    get the same result every time.

    politics. Very smart!

    selecting only three. While I understand that more plugins may consume additional
