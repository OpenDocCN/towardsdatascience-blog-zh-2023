    that might be of interest to those who learn data engineering (DE). I realised
    that there aren‚Äôt many of them in the market explaining data engineering as a
    concept holistically as a whole thing. Some of them are great with how to use
    particular tools and data platform architectures and some of them are my favourite
    bedtime reads: astonishingly easy to fall asleep while reading and gloriously
    boring. Some are great for strategy decision-making and some might seem a bit
    outdated but still useful. I hope you‚Äôll find it interesting.'

    for data engineering. It covers all essential data engineering topics such as
    data modeling and offers an abundance of examples of the most common data transformations.
    As mentioned in the book description it is about Python and data modelling so
    readers will focus on ETL techniques to extract, cleanse and enrich the datasets
    using Python tools. It explains Apache Kafka and Apache Spark in detail but also
    covers the essentials of working with file formats, data transformation and cleansing.
    The book offers some really good views on data pipeline deployments as well as
    working with data environments.

    point of view. It also covers the aspects of modern data infrastructure in the
    cloud, data pipeline monitoring and alerting. I remember I wrote an article on

    I would strongly recommend setting up accounts with one of the cloud platform
    vendors to start learning DE tools available in the market. Many of them offer
    free tier services and shouldn‚Äôt cost anything to explore the latest data engineering
    advances. Just make sure you keep an eye on billing while using free tier tools.
    The overview of the books given in this article will support your learning curve.
    The majority of them assume that readers are comfortable working with JSON, SQL,
    REST APIs and know the basics of Python programming. It corresponds with what
    I wrote before about the data engineering skillset in one of my previous articles.
    I hope you will find it useful.'
