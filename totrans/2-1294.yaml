    firstly, a company, flush with cash, that has cash to invest in growth and doesn’t
    want to lose any talented engineers. Secondly, a company which has financial constraints,
    and chooses to keep the same number of teams and output but take advantage of
    considerable cost savings by reducing their engineering headcount. Lastly, let’s
    consider a company who chooses to maintain their budget, but transform their roles
    and team structures to match the new ratios, so their costs remain neutral but
    their output increases.'

    my product and engineering ratio to other roles, I have assumed that for every
    team we have one product manager and five engineers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will also assume that there are two additional ‘*other*’ roles in each team
    (which could be data engineers, QA, design, UX, devops etc). This brings our teams
    to the ‘five to nine people’, two-pizza sweet spot for the teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, teams don’t run themselves, and so I’ve also assumed that for every team
    there is one more ‘*non-team*’ role in some central or management team, required
    to keep the weight of the organisation from crushing itself, and sending emails
    and buying donuts.
  prefs: []

    models.'

    company earns £65,000 and has additional staffing costs (on-costs) of around 1.5
    times their salary. This gives us a total salary bill of £10m, or thereabouts.
    These numbers (and currency) definitely won’t be realistic for your organisation,
    but they’ll suffice for our needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our 100 person product engineering team (with today’s 5:1 ratio) we have
    89 people working in 11 teams. Across those 11 teams are 11 product managers and
    55 engineers.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scenario 1: Growth'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take a wildly optimistic view. Our first company is not only exceptionally
    profitable and cash rich, but also deeply committed to all of their engineers.
    The leaders take the decision that they don’t want to say farewell to a single
    engineer, and instead want to embrace growth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With our new 1:1 tech and product ratio, this gives an exciting opportunity
    to increase output from 11 value creating teams to 55\. For the first time, that
    might actually be enough to deliver the whole planned roadmap this year!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now of course, this unbounded optimism comes with some challenges. First, they’re
    going to need to hire an incredible number of new product roles — 44, to be exact.
    And any increase in the number of outcomes they’re tracking is going to have a
    knock on impact for all the other roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the ratios we established earlier for other roles like QA, UX and design,
    they’re going to see an increase of 88 ‘*other team*’ roles, just to keep up with
    all the outcomes. And more people mean more people to support the people — more
    managers, more HR business partners, more talent acquisition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This hugely unrealistic, highly optimistic scenario leads us to an organisation
    of almost three times the size (275 people vs 100), with a correspondingly eye
    watering increase in gross salary bill (from £10m to £27m). But, at least we haven’t
    reduced the number of engineering roles, right?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For any company that is currently facing financial challenges from the challenging
    economic climate, the question is always going to be asked by the CFO or CEO;
    “where can we cut our costs”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an emotionless and coolly logical gaze, the question for product and tech
    leaders will become, “how small can our teams be and still deliver the same outcomes”.
    Our new ratios make the answer to this question especially stark. Where once we
    needed 55 engineers to support our 11 teams, the increase in per-developer productivity
    will suggest that we can make drastic cuts to that number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the leaders in the company facing this challenge are making purely economic
    decisions, they will choose to preserve their 11 teams and protect all the outcomes
    they have committed to. But this leads to substantial cuts in the engineering
    function, with 44 roles slashed from the budget.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although our basic ratios show that other team and non-team roles aren’t impacted,
    the reality would probably be different. Our overall product engineering team
    numbers fall from 100 to 55 which bring other benefits. Smaller teams mean less
    complexity, better communication, more overall efficiency and a better signal
    to noise ratio in the organisation. Much as I hate to admit it, the 55 person
    organisation would almost certainly outperform the 100 person organisation.

    is moderately successful and doesn’t have painful financial decisions to make.
    For this company, budgets should remain consistent and there is an opportunity
    to increase the number of outcomes we’re committed to without increasing our costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this model, the product and technology leaders look at the overall budget,
    and based on the new 1:1 ratio realise that they can keep the number of people
    in the organisation the same (100 full time employees), but now increase the number
    of teams working on valuable outcomes to 20.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To increase from 11 teams to 20 requires that we hire 9 new product roles (one
    for each team), and also increase the number of other roles to support these new
    teams. ‘Other team’ roles (like design and QA) grow from 22 to 40, while our non-team
    management and shared service roles grow from 11 to 20.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sadly, the growth of the product and other teams has to be funded without adding
    any costs, and that cost saving comes from the reduction in engineering roles.
    Although not as severe as others, this scenario requires that we also trim 35
    engineering roles from the organisation, a reduction that is predicated on enhanced
    developer productivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This structural change would still be quite jarring for the organisation, but
    considerably less so than the other two scenarios. It keeps overall team size
    and budget consistent, but with a quite different composition.

- en: At the most simple level, the question we have been asking in these scenarios
    is *“Are generative AI tools going to reduce the number of developers by five
    or increase the number of product managers by five?”.* It’s very important to
    remember that the 1:1 ratio is purely hypothetical, and probably the most extreme
    case we could consider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s more likely that the ratio will more subtly reduce to 3:1 or 2:1, based
    on both operational constraints (like covering absence), and the current research
    on the productivity increase (about 55% reduction in time to complete tasks).
