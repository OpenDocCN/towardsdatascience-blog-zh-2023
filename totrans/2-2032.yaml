    to mind is the idea of bits being represented simultaneously as zero and one.
    This is a behavior of microscopic particles that we call [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition).

    the qubit and receive back a random value of zero or one. That is, half of the
    time when we measure the qubit we will receive a result of zero, while the other
    half of the time we will receive a value of one.
