- en: In the dynamic world of data analytics, the need for immediate responses to
    data queries is a common challenge. Whether it’s a last-minute request from a
    manager, an impending board meeting, or a sudden, previously overlooked question
    from the executive team- analysts and ground-level practitioners often find themselves
    caught in the crossfire of urgent reporting demands. While this can be frustrating
    for those who actually need to provide the analysis, we can’t always fault executive
    / mid-level management for not giving advance notice on business questions.

- en: So how can you prepare for and minimize these scenarios? And are there any appropriate
    times to push back on these requests?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, just like every response in data science — it depends. These scenarios
    often place team leads in a true test of their leadership abilities, underscoring
    the importance of maintaining strong relationships with stakeholders and possessing
    a deep understanding of the business model to facilitate swift action. But through
    adhering to well-established development and organizational frameworks, you can
    position your team to be exceptionally well-prepared for these situations.

    When an urgent request comes in their inbox, their first inclination might be
    that the analysis is something that needs to be built from scratch. This is an
    understandable perspective, as leaders aren't responsible for understanding the
    ins and outs of your BI environment.

    business logic can be leveraged for the request. Often times, [leaders are asking
    the same questions about the business](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/10-common-questions-data-analysts-are-likely-to-encounter-and-how-to-answer-them-5d4d967635da),

- en: Let’s assume that the required metric does not exist anywhere else, and it is
    crucial for the organization to answer this ad hoc question immediately. So you
    and your team move forward with the request to pull the required data to answer
    the question. However during the following week, your stakeholder comes back asking
    for an update on the same reporting request, with a refresh of the underlying
    data. In this case, it could be an appropriate time to push back to answer this
    immediately and take the required time to build a more scalable solution.

- en: 'In short, “The 2 Time Rule” accounts for the first request to be truly ad hoc
    which analytics teams can provide the answer in “the quick and dirty way”. But
    any subsequent request means that it is recurring for the business & should be
    treated as a scalable project. In this case, its detrimental to all parties involved
    *to not* build this question into a scalable dashboard or model moving forward.
    This is important for the following reasons:'

- en: As a manager / leading contributor to any analytics team, it is important to
    scope work accordingly. Stakeholders may not know what the best tangible solution
    is to their problem (ie. an Excel Workbook, a Dashboard, a Jupyter Notebook saved
    as a pdf), nor is it their responsibility to. For many department leads who handle
    smaller reporting requests independently, Excel is the dominant tool — likely
    in an environment where underlying data is stagnant and needs to be exported from
    an underlying source system & manually manipulated to summarize a pivot table.
    Because domain focused stakeholders are often not working with advanced tooling,
    it can also be the role of the analyst / team lead to scope the appropriate tool
    to answer a business question.

    report is delivered & discuss what prompted the immediate need. Through this,
    you should look to understand how you and your team can build reporting in the

    have been acquired since the start of a new sales initiative. Your initial reporting
    request might have been to categorize each customer into their respective regions,
    or show a timeseries chart of cumulative daily customer growth. But whenever you
    provide an effective analysis, it sparks additional conversation amongst leadership
    (this is how you can validate that you're outputting quality work). But this also
    means that you should be prepared to dig into the “why” and greater impact of
    your initial analysis.

    think is relevant to its impact on the organization? And Im not just referring
    to adding additional dimensional fields to re-categorize the same metrics. But
    rather, what other perspectives are also important to providing full context around
    the business question your answering?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From this example, another thoughtful idea might also be to compare the new
    sales initiative against customer churn. You might show that new customers are
    being acquired from the new initiative, but how is this impacting the net growth
    of your customer base? You might also want to consider conversion rate. In which
    case, what is the average conversion rate for different customer segments? And
    finally, for customers that failed to convert, what are the reasons as to why
    they said they are not interested?

    stakeholders, the better you will be able to future proof dashboards or models
    for them. Its beneficial for all analysts to work closely with stakeholder teams
    in understanding specific nuances / challenges in their domain. For example, how
    does your operations team log orders, and what are the challenges in accurately
    calculating time to fulfillment for various SKU numbers?

    you are more likely to ask the same questions as them about the business. I’ve
    worked with many great analytics managers who were great at scoping out what stakeholders
    would find most useful in a dashboard before they even asked for it. In one scenario,
    my team was preparing a product revenue report for a board meeting, where we were
    given very specific directions by management on what visuals we were required
    to build. I asked one of my managers:'

    can easily be overlooked as an individual contributor. As an analyst, it can be
    easy to get more focused on the code behind the solution, answering the questions
    provided granularly and at face value. When we find ourselves in this perspective,
    its best to take a step back and holistically understand *why* we are answering
    a particular business question in the first place.

    just about responding to immediate reporting requests but also about building
    a robust and forward-thinking data analytics strategy. By understanding your stakeholders,
    drawing boundaries to management when appropriate, and proactively preparing for
    future reporting needs, you can set your team up to drive impactful analytics.
    Embracing the dynamic nature of your organization and staying ahead of industry
    trends will also ensure that you are always prepared for whatever challenges may
    come your way, making your team an indispensable resource for data-driven decision-making.
