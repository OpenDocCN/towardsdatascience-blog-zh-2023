    or MNIST digit classifier. Projects like these have been done a million times,
    and they add very little to your profile because there’s no way for employers
    to verify that the work is your own. For all they know, you’ve just copied and

    Prediction: they’re boring, and it’s hard to set yourself apart by doing them

    not saying you have to reinvent the wheel. There will be plenty of times when
    a simple Linear Regression model with a well-known dataset is all that’s needed.
    But — and here’s the clincher — if you do plan on using a well-known dataset,
    you still need to show that you can think creatively and critically about how
    to use it. Don’t just reproduce others’ work with this dataset; try and identify
    a new approach you can take with the data and/or show how it links back to the
    industry you’re targeting. I’ll explain how I approach this very shortly.

    or companies you’re targeting. Not only does this signal that you’re capable of
    solving real-world problems; by doing these kinds of projects, you’ll build your
    understanding of what the industry’s challenges are, giving you great fodder for
    interviews.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason *relevance* is so important is that, as techies, I think we can have
    a tendency to get so absorbed in the details of our algorithms and tech stacks
    that we forget to make it clear to non-techies which problems we’re solving. This
    is a problem because if we can’t articulate this, we’re unlikely to convince anyone
    to adopt our solutions and we’re unlikely to drive any value.

  prefs: []

    Netflix as an example. What’s Netflix’s big picture problem? [Telling stories](https://about.netflix.com/en).
    The fundamental problems that Netflix are trying to tackle include deciding which
    stories to tell, how to tell them, and how to make sure as many people as possible
    are moved by them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An organisation’s **operational problems**, by contrast, tend to be much less
    specific. Operational problems are the day-to-day problems that a business faces
    as it tries to solve its big picture problem. Netflix, for example, faces operational
    problems like churn (people cancelling their contracts), marketing (how to attract
    new customers), recruitment, demand forecasting, measuring performance, as well
    as thousands more. As you can see, operational problems aren’t really specific
    to Netflix at all; in some way, all organisations will face problems like this.

    I do when trying to come up with a good Data Science project idea is to make a
    list of all the problems faced by organisations that I’m interested in working
    for. How I do I identify these? A good place to start is companies’ vision statements
    and *About* pages, which are usually the places where they’ve tried to articulate
    in their own words which problems they’re trying to solve.

    neatly summarises the main problems for you. Thank you very much, Deloitte!

    learning *tasks* could be relevant, you could start by thinking about what some
    relevant *datasets* could be, and then take a look at sites like Kaggle to see
    if others have used machine learning on any similar datasets. For example, if
    you identify *churn* as an organisational problem your target company faces, go
    onto Kaggle and search for datasets related to churn, and see what others have
    done using these datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to get ideas is to see whether your target company has a blog where
    they document their Data Science and Engineering work. Here, you’ll be able to
    see examples of problems they have worked on and how machine learning is being
    used to tackle them. Of course, small companies might not have these kinds of
    blogs, but large ones often will. Some of my personal favourites are the blogs
    of [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/), [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/engineering/),
    [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/tag/engineering/), [Meta](https://medium.com/meta-analytics)
    and [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/category/data-science/). By reading
    these, you’ll quickly get a sense of how their Data Science teams are framing
    their companies’ big picture and organisational problems in terms of machine learning.

    for something like “machine learning {the-industry-im-interested-in, e.g. media,

    examples of where people have tried applying machine learning in this space.

    obvious place to start, but if you’re looking for something a bit more bespoke
    you might want to check out sources like [BigQuery Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data)
    and [Harvard Dataverse](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-dataverse).
    I’ve also found a lot of success with looking at the GitHub pages of Data Science
    academics, which often include customised datasets which are freely available
    to use. That’s how I came across the [Fragile Families](https://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/)
    dataset and [Hate Speech Data](https://github.com/leondz/hatespeechdata).

- en: Once you’ve decided on a task and dataset, you need to think carefully about
    how to put your unique spin on the project. The crucial thing to recognise here
    is that **you don’t have to reinvent the wheel**. It’s perfectly OK to take inspiration
    from past work, using pre-existing datasets and tackling the problems using common
    algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forests. Your goal is not to make
    the project original in every single way; your goal is to find ONE meaningful
    way in which you can put your unique spin on things.

    I didn’t use a particularly innovative data source or visualisation/engineering
    approach, but was still able to differentiate the project by using a cutting-edge
    NLP model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). When I completed the Fragile
    Families Challenge project, on the other hand, my modelling approach was incredibly
    simple (Linear Regression and Random Forests). The way I differentiated my work
    was by using NLP techniques to extract more nuanced features and using `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`
    to neatly organise my code and package it up. On another occasion, when completing
    the most cliched project possible (at the time) — analysis of mobility patterns
    during Covid-19 lockdowns — I differentiated by producing some customised visualisations
    through which I tried to show my flair for communicating data insights.
