    you think you are done with interview prep. But you might be missing the most
    important and hardest-to-prepare-for part of the interview — problem-solving skills.
    And based on my experience of interviewing others as well as going through interviews
    myself, I can confidently tell you, this part is more than often what makes or
    breaks your interviews.

    articles, I have mostly touched on technical concepts that commonly show up in
    interviews. For reference, the previous articles are listed below:'

    is the most difficult part; I think the soft skills are the hardest to grasp,
    learn or teach when it comes to interview prep. As a manager, that’s the most
    important thing I look for when I’m hiring for my team. Because let’s face it,
    technical skills are easy to brush up on and learn (not only for humans, but also
    for machines — ChatGPT can implement code pretty well these days), but the ability
    to understand, solve business problems and communicate effectively is not something
    you can build up in a day or two.

    of a template interviewers follow; instead, a lot of times the interview would
    go in the direction you take it. Before you get discouraged, I have summarized
    a couple of ways the soft skills are tested in interviews and tips that can help
    you prepare for this part of the interview.
  prefs: []

- en: There are in general two modules of the interview that fit into the soft-skill
    category — case study (which is to test your ability to carry out structured problem
    solving) and behavioral interview (which tests your communication and again, structured
    thinking ability).

- en: This portion of the interview is usually a case that’s very similar to the consulting
    case interview, with a slight data science flavor added on top. It’s usually a
    RCA (root cause analysis) type of question for a metric movement or business decision.
    Examples are questions like “our daily active user decreased by 10% in the past
    week, how to debug what the cause is?” OR “we want to put electric chargers for
    our fleet around SF, how should we make the decision about where to put them?”
  prefs: []

- en: '**What is it testing?** These questions are testing your ability to come up
    with a problem-solving framework and your ability to explain the framework. It’s
    extremely important to have one in your day-to-day work as a data scientist so
    you can make sure that your solution is thorough, comprehensive and can easily
    make sense to others.'

- en: '**What do interviewers want to see?** Keep in mind there’s no right or wrong
    answer for this kind of questions, only organized or unorganized ones. The interviewers
    really want to see how you organize your thoughts and walk people through the
    problem-solving process. So make sure you verbalize all the assumptions you are
    making, all the details you are exploring and ask all the clarifying questions
    you might need to ask.'

    Sometimes your interviewer will give you some guidance or hint about where they
    want you to take the case

- en: '**How to prepare?** The best way to prepare for a case interview is practice,
    practice and practice. I suggest getting yourself one or two books related to
    consulting case interviews or PM case interviews, books like ***cracking the PM
    interview*** and ***case interview secrets*** come to mind as recommendations.
    But just reading through the examples the trying to force memorize the frameworks
    in the books won’t help as much. The most effective thing to do in my opinion
    is to take sample cases in the book and mock the case with a friend. Very likely
    your answer will not be identical as the “sample solution”, but ask your friend
    to check “is my thinking process easy to follow?”, “was it clear how to arrived
    at each step in the process?”.'

    that the team is looking for aside from hard skills. And if the interviewer is
    a hiring manager, they would want to see that they can effectively communicate

- en: '**What do interviewers want to see?** Depending on the team, interviewers/hiring
    managers may care about/want to test different things. But in most cases, I have
    seen interview questions aiming to prob about your ability to learn, to adapt
    to changing scope, to collaborate with others and to manage stakeholders.'

- en: '**How to prepare?** A couple things can be helpful for this portion of the
    interview. 1) Make sure you are super familiar with any project you have on your
    resume, because the interviewer will likely ask about details of different projects
    on your resume to get a sense of your working style. And 2) make sure you practice
    the top-down communication style and follow the [STAR framework](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)
    when talking about your projects.'

- en: Finally, always remember, interviews are a two-way assessment; you are gauging
    the company’s fit for you as much as they you, and the behavioral portion of the
    interview is the best way to test whether YOU like THEM. The people who interview
    you will likely be the group of people you work really closely with; so if you
    feel like the “vibe is off” (which trust me, happens more than you would expect),
    maybe it’s a good signal you should take into the consideration when deciding
    between offers.
