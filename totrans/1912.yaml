    a mean relative to the population.

    µ1 and µ2\. Remember that a confidence interval calculation is only approximate
    for large samples with differences that are not normally distributed. Our assumptions
    for calculating a t-interval calculation are having a large sample/differences
    that are normally distributed and having a simple random sample (SRS).

- en: In this bootcamp we’ve covered t-testing extensively. Specifically, when to
    use paired and non-paired t-tests. After reading this article, you should recognize
    scenarios when data violates the assumption of independence and for those that
    retain their independence how to perform the necessary calculations. We also explored
    the subcategories within independent t-tests — i.e. pooled and non-pooled, so
    always remember to check your standard deviations. Whenever we make inferences
    from data it is ALWAYS important to acknowledge and assumptions we made in performing
    the analysis.
