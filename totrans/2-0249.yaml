    It represents a continuous topographic elevation surface through a series of cells
    where each cell represents the elevation (Z) of a feature at its location (X and
    Y). Digital Elevation Models only contain information about the elevation of geological
    features, such as valleys, mountains, and landslides, and do not include any elevation
    data concerning features such as vegetation or buildings.'

- en: Accurate high-resolution DEM data is important for hazard mapping because it
    provides a detailed representation of the terrain which is essential for assessing
    potential risks posed by natural hazards. This data can better inform predictive
    models of how climate change will affect various land surfaces, by allowing scientists
    to measure the effects of changing temperature, precipitation, and other climate-related
    factors on land surfaces of different elevations. DEM data can also be used to
    identify areas that are at risk of flooding, landslides, and other extreme weather
    events, which can help inform policy decisions about how to mitigate the impacts
    of climate change. Additionally, DEM data helps to create detailed maps which
    can be used to create evacuation plans, alert systems, and other risk-management
    strategies.

    to the number of times that particular elevation value occurs within the data
    set. A DEM histogram can be used to identify elevation extremes, as well as to
    detect elevation outliers or to determine the overall elevation range within the

- en: Slope is a terrain attribute, or measurement, that describes the rate of change
    in elevation in a given area. It is the measure of the steepness or inclination
    of a surface and is typically represented as a percentage or an angle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The slope of a DEM is typically expressed in degrees, ranging from 0° (flat)
    to 90° (vertical). Armenia is generally a mountainous country, with most of its
    terrain featuring steep slopes. The country does have some flat or gently sloping
    areas, primarily in the valleys of the Aras and Araks rivers.

- en: When the slope is represented as a percentage, it is calculated as the ratio
    of the elevation (rise) over a given distance (run) and is called ***Slope Rise-Run.*
    A slope** rise-run of 14% means that for every 100 units horizontally, the slope
    rises by 14 units vertically. For example, the highest slope rise-run is located
    in the Caucasus Mountains in Armenia, near the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan.
    The Caucasus Mountains in Armenia are a range of mountains that form part of the
    Euro-Asian mountain system and are located in the south of the country. The average
    elevation of the mountain range is approximately 4,500 meters (14,764 feet). The
    average slope of the Caucasus Mountains in Armenia is 15%.

    a given location on the surface of the earth. It is measured as an angle from
    0 to 360 degrees, with 0° representing the north, 90° representing the east, 180°
    representing the south, and 270° representing the west.

- en: Visualizing and analyzing digital elevation models is important for many use
    cases around climate change, hazard risk mitigation, and infrastructure planning
    as it allows for the analysis of topographic features that are essential for understanding
    the dynamics of climate change, assessing the risk of natural hazards, and designing
    effective infrastructure projects. DEM data also form the basis for generating
    digital terrain models, which can be used to map areas vulnerable to flooding,
    landslides, and other extreme weather events. Furthermore, DEM data can be used
    to create detailed 3D models of landscapes and terrain that can be used to simulate
    potential infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridges, and to assess their
    environmental impact.

    explore, and visualize the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and its attributes. With
    this knowledge, you can use Python to create detailed maps of terrain and analyze
    the elevation of different areas. In addition, you can use Python to compare different
    DEMs and their attributes and gain insights into changes in terrain over time.
    With these tools, you will be able to explore and analyze the landscape in depth.

    province, Armenia — home to Mount Aragats, the highest peak in the country. Mount
    Aragats is an extinct volcanic mountain, which is composed of four separate peaks,
    each of which can be climbed, hence a dream destination for hikers and climbers.
