    and we have seen Generative AI (GenAI) take the world by storm. From large language
    models (LLMs) to stable diffusion models for image generation, it is really quite
    remarkable what this new technology can do. A friend described it to me as the
    first time AI has felt tangible to them, as if what we only dreamed about through
    science fiction has now become reality.

    can’t do to transform their business processes. There are certainly many cool
    things you can do with GenAI, but there are also some misconceptions floating
    around out there that business leaders should be cautious about. The focus of
    this post is to share with you some of the core things that GenAI can do while
    also tempering one’s expectations to caution on what it cannot do.

    is the ability to use large language models (LLM) in particular to condense a
    lot of information into something far more digestible. For example, you can take
    a transcribed dialogue from a meeting and use GenAI to summarize the information
    into a few key bullets. Additionally, you can take a large legal document and
    have an LLM pull out the most relevant bits of information. Of course, you should
    always be cautious to verify that the output of the LLM is correct, but this can
    save a ton of time in many different business contexts. I highly expect this to
    continue to gain traction in more and more industries over time.

    In reality, LLMs are simply word prediction machines, albeit these models are
    so interestingly precise that it almost appears as if they are emulating true
    consciousness. Because LLMs act on probabilities between words, it can never be
    truly certain of its final output. Ironically however, it always will produce
    a very confident output. We refer to these confident but false statements as **hallucinations**.

    however, unlike the human, the LLM won’t tell you, “I don’t know.” Instead, it
    will confidently give an answer, except you and I know that the LLM can’t possibly

    context. In the GenAI community, we refer to this as **retrieval augmented generation
    (RAG)**. If we were to ask the LLM to fill in the blank above without any additional
    context, it will definitely give us an answer, but that answer may be hallucinated.
    Now, let’s say we gave the LLM some additional context. Let’s alter what we might
    input to the LLM with the following:'

    in its response. Remember, the LLM is assessing probabilities between words. In
    the RAG process, we are simply augmenting the probability of producing an output
    with a more correct answer. This doesn’t boost the probability of certainty to
    100%, but it definitely can help quite a bit!

    answer, the RAG process is not one that is automatic. In other words, GenAI technologies
    like LLMs don’t have the ability to go learning things for itself. These GenAI
    models are trained on information provided to it at a snapshot in time, almost
    as if its knowledge is frozen to that fixed date. When we provide additional context
    to the LLM, the context can be helpful to produce a more precise output, but **this
    RAG context is NOT actually altering the underlying model itself**.

    you can tell GenAI itself to go find that information for itself. Even in the
    cases like Bing Chat where it appears that the LLM is searching the internet,
    it is not actually the model that is crawling the internet. **Rather, the information
    is being brought to the LLM, and the LLM is making sense of what is brought to
    it.** We’ve not yet reached that Skynet-like level of superintelligence where
    these AI models can figure things out for themselves. 🤖

    about the word “can” with this point. It’s no secret that people have found ways
    to leverage LLMs for coding purposes, and to be perfectly clear, LLMs can be great
    for helping to write code. Whether it be autofilling common tasks or helping to
    debug errors, GenAI can be a very useful tool when it comes to coding.

    by being trained on information at a snapshot in time, my personal experience
    is that the LLMs tend to hallucinate quite a bit when asked to write code for
    very nuanced situations. **Remember, LLMs are only as good as the context you
    provide it.** If you have an error that stems from something related to your very
    specific system, the LLM can’t be aware of your system’s details and will thus
    ultimately hallucinate the answer. This isn’t to say that GenAI can’t be helpful
    for writing code, but I would view it more as an assistant than anything.

    fact, OpenAI at one point released a tool to help teachers determine if a piece
    of homework was created using ChatGPT. Eventually, OpenAI retracted this tool,
    and if you understand the underlying math and architecture of these GenAI solutions,
    I would contest that we’re quickly getting to a point where this will literally
    be impossible.

    GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 2\. These LLMs can produce outputs that appear extremely
    human-like, and this is because the underlying architecture is able to assess
    the probabilities between words with a staggering level of precision. Carefully
    treading the line between actual and artificial consciousness, one can’t help
    but wonder if human speech can also be predicted as probabilities between words.
    At that point, the end results of an LLM and a human are probabilistically indistinguishable,
    so no tool would be able to definitively say, “This was made by GenAI; this was
    made by a human.”

    interface like ChatGPT, almost all the major GenAI players offer programmatic
    solutions through things like APIs. This means we can engineer GenAI technology
    into new and existing software processes. In fact, most GenAI startups are doing
    precisely this. Specifically, many GenAI startups are using APIs from providers
    like OpenAI or Anthropic as a backend “engine” to support their GenAI needs. (Which
    is why you should also be careful who your company chooses to do business with,
    as they are probably interacting with a 4th party behind the scenes!)

    While GenAI can produce snippets of code to do things like query specific information
    from a database, I personally would never rely on an LLM for a task like this.
    Because we can’t have 100% certainty that the code would be correct, it would
    be imprudent to rely on GenAI this way. This isn’t to say you should never incorporate
    GenAI into your software systems! There are still great use cases where you can
    leverage GenAI in a programmatic solution in a way that is still beneficial while
    also still being cautious.

    attention this far, you’ll understand why this isn’t possible. Though LLMs are
    trained on information at a snapshot in time, it’s not as if it is tying all the
    probabilities between words back to specific sources. What the LLM is only storing
    is referred to what is known as **weights and biases**. Without going too deep
    into the underlying architecture of LLMs, LLMs are essentially comprised of tons
    of mathematical operations, and at the time of training, these weights and biases
    are updated to more closely align to the information it is being trained on. (Actually,
    if I were to deeply explain the architecture of an LLM, you’d be astounded that
    the math is rudimentary enough that it almost seems magical that LLMs can do as
    much as they can!)

  zh: 这是我经常被问到的问题，如果你到现在为止都在认真听讲，你会明白为什么这是不可能的。尽管LLM是在某一时间点上的信息上进行训练的，但并不是说它将所有词语之间的概率联系到具体的来源。LLM所存储的仅仅是被称为**权重和偏差**的东西。无需深入LLM的底层架构，LLM本质上由大量数学操作组成，在训练时，这些权重和偏差会更新以更贴近它所训练的信息。（实际上，如果我详细解释LLM的架构，你会惊讶于数学的基础到几乎令人感到神奇的程度，LLM能够做得如此之多！）
- en: That’s all there is to an LLM. **There’s no direct tie back to the source information,
    so if you were to ask it to cite its own source, you would receive a hallucination
    at best**. I actually believe specific LLMs like ChatGPT have been fine tuned
    to say that its not possible to reveal its sources, which I would say is a better
    response than a hallucinated one. But it’s not impossible to receive a hallucinated
    response. There’s [the infamous scenario](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2023/attorneys-face-sanctions-after-citing-information-hallucinated-by-chatgpt/)
    where a lawyer used an LLM to cite a source in a legal case, and it was discovered
    that the cited source was hallucinated and ultimately fake. Be careful you don’t
    also fall into this same trap!

    can also simply be a good assistant at any knowledge task. I personally use LLMs
    like ChatGPT as a sort of “search engine” for general knowledge questions. For
    example, it is excellent at providing definitions to words, and it is great to
    receive more elaborative answers as you follow up with additional questions. It’s
    like interacting with a very knowledgeable friend. While internet search engines
    can provide the most up-to-date and relevant information, the back-and-forth of
    a conversation flow is unmatched by a barebones search engine.

    While LLMs might be more helpful about historical events and locations like Ancient
    Rome, you’ll certainly receive a hallucinated answer if you asked it what today’s
    weather is. If it does provide back a correct answer, this would again be because
    the LLM is being augmented in a RAG manner, NOT because the LLM was able to derive
    that information itself. Also, beware of using LLMs for math problems specifically.
    Remember, these LLMs are trained to look for probabilities between words, so there’s
    not any mathematical computation being done when a math problem is given to it.
    In recent months, popular LLMs like ChatGPT have been seemingly augmented to handle
    math problems better, but it is unclear how they are doing this. In any case,
    I would still try to avoid doing complex math problems with an LLM.
