    and we have seen Generative AI (GenAI) take the world by storm. From large language
    models (LLMs) to stable diffusion models for image generation, it is really quite
    remarkable what this new technology can do. A friend described it to me as the
    first time AI has felt tangible to them, as if what we only dreamed about through
    science fiction has now become reality.

    can‚Äôt do to transform their business processes. There are certainly many cool
    things you can do with GenAI, but there are also some misconceptions floating
    around out there that business leaders should be cautious about. The focus of
    this post is to share with you some of the core things that GenAI can do while
    also tempering one‚Äôs expectations to caution on what it cannot do.

    is the ability to use large language models (LLM) in particular to condense a
    lot of information into something far more digestible. For example, you can take
    a transcribed dialogue from a meeting and use GenAI to summarize the information
    into a few key bullets. Additionally, you can take a large legal document and
    have an LLM pull out the most relevant bits of information. Of course, you should
    always be cautious to verify that the output of the LLM is correct, but this can
    save a ton of time in many different business contexts. I highly expect this to
    continue to gain traction in more and more industries over time.

    In reality, LLMs are simply word prediction machines, albeit these models are
    so interestingly precise that it almost appears as if they are emulating true
    consciousness. Because LLMs act on probabilities between words, it can never be
    truly certain of its final output. Ironically however, it always will produce
    a very confident output. We refer to these confident but false statements as **hallucinations**.

    the RAG process, we are simply augmenting the probability of producing an output
    with a more correct answer. This doesn‚Äôt boost the probability of certainty to
    100%, but it definitely can help quite a bit!

    answer, the RAG process is not one that is automatic. In other words, GenAI technologies
    like LLMs don‚Äôt have the ability to go learning things for itself. These GenAI
    models are trained on information provided to it at a snapshot in time, almost
    as if its knowledge is frozen to that fixed date. When we provide additional context
    to the LLM, the context can be helpful to produce a more precise output, but **this
    RAG context is NOT actually altering the underlying model itself**.

    you can tell GenAI itself to go find that information for itself. Even in the
    cases like Bing Chat where it appears that the LLM is searching the internet,
    it is not actually the model that is crawling the internet. **Rather, the information
    is being brought to the LLM, and the LLM is making sense of what is brought to
    it.** We‚Äôve not yet reached that Skynet-like level of superintelligence where
    these AI models can figure things out for themselves. ü§ñ

    about the word ‚Äúcan‚Äù with this point. It‚Äôs no secret that people have found ways
    to leverage LLMs for coding purposes, and to be perfectly clear, LLMs can be great
    for helping to write code. Whether it be autofilling common tasks or helping to
    debug errors, GenAI can be a very useful tool when it comes to coding.

    by being trained on information at a snapshot in time, my personal experience
    is that the LLMs tend to hallucinate quite a bit when asked to write code for
    very nuanced situations. **Remember, LLMs are only as good as the context you
    provide it.** If you have an error that stems from something related to your very
    specific system, the LLM can‚Äôt be aware of your system‚Äôs details and will thus
    ultimately hallucinate the answer. This isn‚Äôt to say that GenAI can‚Äôt be helpful
    for writing code, but I would view it more as an assistant than anything.

    fact, OpenAI at one point released a tool to help teachers determine if a piece
    of homework was created using ChatGPT. Eventually, OpenAI retracted this tool,

    be impossible.

    GPT-4 and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 2\. These LLMs can produce outputs that appear extremely
    human-like, and this is because the underlying architecture is able to assess
    the probabilities between words with a staggering level of precision. Carefully
    treading the line between actual and artificial consciousness, one can‚Äôt help
    but wonder if human speech can also be predicted as probabilities between words.
    At that point, the end results of an LLM and a human are probabilistically indistinguishable,
    so no tool would be able to definitively say, ‚ÄúThis was made by GenAI; this was
    made by a human.‚Äù

    interface like ChatGPT, almost all the major GenAI players offer programmatic
    solutions through things like APIs. This means we can engineer GenAI technology
    into new and existing software processes. In fact, most GenAI startups are doing
    precisely this. Specifically, many GenAI startups are using APIs from providers
    like OpenAI or Anthropic as a backend ‚Äúengine‚Äù to support their GenAI needs. (Which
    is why you should also be careful who your company chooses to do business with,
    as they are probably interacting with a 4th party behind the scenes!)

    While GenAI can produce snippets of code to do things like query specific information
    from a database, I personally would never rely on an LLM for a task like this.
    Because we can‚Äôt have 100% certainty that the code would be correct, it would
    be imprudent to rely on GenAI this way. This isn‚Äôt to say you should never incorporate
    GenAI into your software systems! There are still great use cases where you can
    leverage GenAI in a programmatic solution in a way that is still beneficial while
    also still being cautious.

    attention this far, you‚Äôll understand why this isn‚Äôt possible. Though LLMs are
    trained on information at a snapshot in time, it‚Äôs not as if it is tying all the
    probabilities between words back to specific sources. What the LLM is only storing
    is referred to what is known as **weights and biases**. Without going too deep
    into the underlying architecture of LLMs, LLMs are essentially comprised of tons
    of mathematical operations, and at the time of training, these weights and biases
    are updated to more closely align to the information it is being trained on. (Actually,
    if I were to deeply explain the architecture of an LLM, you‚Äôd be astounded that
    the math is rudimentary enough that it almost seems magical that LLMs can do as
    much as they can!)

    so if you were to ask it to cite its own source, you would receive a hallucination
    at best**. I actually believe specific LLMs like ChatGPT have been fine tuned
    to say that its not possible to reveal its sources, which I would say is a better
    response than a hallucinated one. But it‚Äôs not impossible to receive a hallucinated
    response. There‚Äôs [the infamous scenario](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2023/attorneys-face-sanctions-after-citing-information-hallucinated-by-chatgpt/)
    where a lawyer used an LLM to cite a source in a legal case, and it was discovered

    While LLMs might be more helpful about historical events and locations like Ancient
    Rome, you‚Äôll certainly receive a hallucinated answer if you asked it what today‚Äôs
    weather is. If it does provide back a correct answer, this would again be because
    the LLM is being augmented in a RAG manner, NOT because the LLM was able to derive
    that information itself. Also, beware of using LLMs for math problems specifically.
    Remember, these LLMs are trained to look for probabilities between words, so there‚Äôs
    not any mathematical computation being done when a math problem is given to it.
    In recent months, popular LLMs like ChatGPT have been seemingly augmented to handle
    math problems better, but it is unclear how they are doing this. In any case,
    I would still try to avoid doing complex math problems with an LLM.
