    I kicked off the “Read with Me” book club to explore Judea Pearl’s “The Book of
    Why”. I would like to thank everyone who has shown interest and [signed up](https://zzhu17.medium.com/subscribe)
    to join the club. I am hopeful that we can embark on a journey to deepen our understanding
    of causality by reading and sharing insights together. After two weeks, as promised,
    I am sharing some key points I took from the first two chapters.

    reviews the historical development of causal theory. We will further deep dive
    into the three Rungs.

- en: Back in 1800, from Galton to Pearson, as they sought to understand how humans
    inherit genetic traits, they found that correlation was sufficient in a scientific
    sense. After all, “***Data is all there is to science***." To them, causality
    is merely a special case of correlation that can never be proven. On the other
    hand, correlation is powerful enough to explain why sons of taller fathers are
    taller than the population average. Correlation-based forecasting models make
    predictions by identifying the most predictive variables to the target of interest,
    even though it might not make sense in many cases. For example, there is a strong
    correlation between a nation’s per capita ***chocolate consumption*** and its
    number of ***Nobel Prize winners***. Apparently, eating more chocolate wouldn’t
    give you a higher chance of winning the Nobel Prize, and a country’s wealth is
    more likely to be the confounder here. We can find a lot of examples like this
    one that don’t give meaningful and scientific information. When presented with
    these findings, Pearson dismissed them as mere “**spurious**” correlations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides “spurious” correlation, it is also common to find correlation found
    in population reversed in subgroups. For example, when measuring the correlation
    between skull length and breadth, the correlation is negligible when measured
    separately in male and female groups. However, it is significant when combining
    the gender groups. This is common when confounders exist, and we call it Simpson’s
    Paradox.

    decent accuracy during static settings. Statisticians have developed many sophisticated
    models to extract insights from data. With larger data samples collected and more
    complicated algorithms embedded, we can build decent models to predict sales,
    customer churns/retention, etc. However, when facing new situations, correlation-based
    models cannot make trustworthy predictions lacking historical data. To maintain
    good performance, model developers must keep feeding the models with more and
    more data, covering all existing situations explicitly, which is always lagging
    behind new settings. Just as Pearl wrote:'

    will happen to this product’s sales if I increase its price? Will this customer
    continue to pay a subscription if I stop giving him promotions? Rung 2 questions
    cannot be answered by correlation-based models anymore. For example, when we use
    observational data to find the past correlation between price and sales, it is
    likely to be biased by the macroeconomic situation, sales and price of other products,
    etc. Rather than estimating the pure impact of price on sales, observational data
    show the combinations of many factors’ impacts on sales. Some of these factors
    can be observed and quantified, but some are hard to quantify, preventing us from
    getting the pure impact.

    path diagram illustrating the factors leading to coat color in guinea pigs. The
    diagram not only lists all factors but also gives guidance on estimating the strength
    of each factor. To answer Rung 2 questions, besides data collected from Rung 1,
    we will need causal hypotheses, like Wright’s path diagram. The following graph
    illustrates a causal diagram Wright proposed to estimate the birth weight of guinea
    pigs.

    factor. For example, what’s the pure impact of the gestation period on birth weight?
    Even if there are factors we cannot quantify or unobserved by us, we can propose
    other factor that is closely correlated with the unquantifiable factors and estimate
    their effect appropriately in the causal diagram. The concept of instrument variable
    originated from here.

    1920s, it was the theory that was never accepted by the mainstream. Judea compared
    the situation with Galileo when he claimed Earth revolves around the sun. The
    objection came from the norm that “***data were to receive priority in all cases
    over opinions and interpretations***.” After all, data are objective, and opinions
    are subjective. However, as Judea wrote:'

- en: Things only began to change around the 1960s, when economists and sociologists
    started using structural equation models (SEM). These models embedded causalities
    in linear algebra. Among the structural equations, there are variables specified
    as endogenous variables, which are causally related to the target, and others
    are called exogenous variables. Including endogenous variables helps solve the
    confounding problems when drawing a causal conclusion. The only drawback is that
    the causalities that exist in these models are non-directional. Thus, it still
    doesn’t solve the issue of reverse causality for questions like could it be that
    y caused x rather than x caused y?

    emergence of Bayesian theory, which provides an objective way of combining observed
    data with subject prior knowledge. Bayesian statistics start with a subjective
    prior belief, such as a coin is not fair, and then they keep revising their belief
    by collecting new evidence — tossing the coin multiple times. If we see the head
    roughly half the time, then modify the belief that the coin should be fair. Due
    to the inclusion of subjectivity, the causality theory starts with Bayesian probability,
    then takes a huge detour, which is the story that will be shared in the next chapters.

    ***imagination*** takes place. It helps our ancestors to experiment with different
    scenarios by making local alterations to the model. For example, if we increase
    the number of hunters, how much can we increase the success rate? If the size
    of a mammoth is larger than usual, how many more hunters should we include to
    maintain the same success rate? The ability of imagination takes us to the highest
    ladder in causality at Rung 3.

- en: Counterfactuals have a particularly problematic relationship with data because
    data are facts, and counterfactuals are imaginations. Data cannot tell us what
    will happen in an imaginary world where some observed facts are bluntly negated.
    Causal models, on the other hand, can guide us in this scenario by helping us
    reason what would have happened. In the business world, these “would haves” represent
    the most profitable questions — what would have happened to the product sales
    had I increased the price? Answering these questions correctly will guide us to
    make any decision with confidence.

    **Finding why behind what** is innate to human intelligence, which, at the same
    time, is what AI lacks. AI cannot resemble human-level intelligence without causal
    structures — — the compact representation of human subjective thought processes.
