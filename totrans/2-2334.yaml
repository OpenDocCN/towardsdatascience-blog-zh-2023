    form of probabilities between 0 and 1\. And because probability is a measure of

    calculates the probability of those words and patterns occurring in a positive
    review versus a negative review. This probability is called the **joint probability**
    and is defined as the probability of a set of features occurring together in the
    data. For instance, the model may learn that words like “broken” and “disappointed”
    occur frequently together within negative reviews while words like “highly recommend”
    and “very satisfied” occur frequently together in positive reviews.

    in the machine learning community, the easiest way to explain how a model generates
    new text is to say that it *predicts the next word in a series based on the text
    the model was trained on and the text in the prompt.* In the example below, the
    model predicts that the word “smoothies” has the highest probability of occurring
    next in the response. This is influenced by the fact that the model has learned
    from the training data that words like “smoothies” and “shakes” are related to
    “blender” as well as the fact that our prompt asks the model to mention the word
    “smoothies” in the response.

    and variations in the input data which allows them to calculate the joint probability
    of features occurring together. This enables them to predict probabilities of
    existing data belonging to a given class (e.g. positive or negative reviews) and
    generate new data that resembles the training data. But what exactly does this
    “new data” look like? The truth is, data generated by machine learning models

    Because open source models generally undergo less stringent (if any) post-model

- en: The misuse of generative video technology swiftly became apparent when it was
    employed to harass and threaten women through the distribution of [deepfake pornographic
    content](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/deepfake-porn-victims-are-seeking-federal-protections-through-a-new-bill?ref=gptechblog.com).
    In March 2023, the Federal Trade Commission released a [statement](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes?ref=gptechblog.com)
    urging caution as phishing scams exploded in complexity thanks to the use of “voice
    cloning,” an AI trained on a short audio clip of a person’s voice that can then
    be prompted by text to say just about anything.

    promise, it’s crucial to be aware of its risks and limitations, especially given
    the current lack of legislation regulating its creation and use. This means taking
    time to deliberately weigh the potential benefits of using generative AI with
    adverse consequences, taking ethical considerations into account. Here are some
    [tips](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/ai-best-practices/?ref=gptechblog.com)

- en: In this article, we’ve discussed the key aspects of generative machine learning
    models, particularly their capacity to differentiate between various data types
    and to create new data that closely resembles existing data. The quality of generative
    models has increased dramatically in the last decade, leading to an explosion
    of investment in the companies and technologies behind generative AI, namely in
    regard to generative text, images, and audio.

    accuracy, and creating harmful content. We must continue to monitor these issues
    and practice personal vigilance and awareness when using generative AI products.
