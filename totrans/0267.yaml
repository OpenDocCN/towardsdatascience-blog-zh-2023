    a lot about about [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
    (LLMs). Probably the most well-known example is [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/),
    which more specifically is an LLM-based chatbot developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
    ChatGPT is known among developers to offer a powerful help related to coding.

    and many of our conversations were related to Python coding. They led me to think
    that if one doesn’t know too much about Python, Bard would not be a good teacher.
    Its¹ replies helped me a lot, but I quickly noticed that I had to be careful when
    talking to it: many of its replies were misleading, difficult to understand, or
    even incorrect. So, while it indeed helped me answer some Python questions, it
    was rather clear to me that Bard was not ready to teach Python beginners, not
    yet.'

    whether it knows Python and how it works with it. In the first stage, I asked
    Bard whether it can use Python and how it does this. I learned that it knows Python
    and considers itself a very good Python programmer. It also told me that it can
    run Python 3.10, both in a containerized environment and directly in a Python
    session. In addition, Bard told me it can install and use PyPi packages.

    exercises to figure out whether Bard can be considered a good source of Python

    that will look very sensibly — but unfortunately these will not be real sources.
    Instead, it will come up with some sensibly sounding names, titles and journals
