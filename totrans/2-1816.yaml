    past several years. Of the many convenient [add-ins](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    available, there is one that I’ve so thoroughly integrated into my workflow that
    I immediately add it when I start using a different computer. It’s the Scratchpad,
    pictured below.

    to make a quick test to see if a code snippet works. Or maybe you want to output
    something, but doing so in your current working cell would disrupt something else.
    With a scratchpad, it’s super convenient to simply press `ctrl+B` and have a new
    cell pop up. I use this feature almost more than anything else. Not only is it
    nicer for keeping extra cells out of my code and forgetting that they’re there,
    but it’s also *faster* — just a couple taps of `ctrl+B` to open and close, as
    opposed to adding and deleting new cells and scrolling up and down a page. It’s
    almost like having a dual monitor for your Jupyter Notebook.

- en: There are plenty of tutorials showing you how to [download](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
    and add this extension (go ahead and explore the other unofficial extensions while
    you’re at it, and let me know if there are any that you love!). I wouldn’t have
    written this post, except for one reason. I recently have been using Google Colab
    far more frequently, and was frustrated that there didn’t seem to be a way to
    get the same functionality. It almost was enough to make me not use Colab. I tried
    to find a workaround with a few Google searches, but the “[Scratchpad](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb)”
    I came across was nothing like what I was looking for. Then I stumbled across
    something with similar functionality. Now, at the time of writing this post, it’s
    not as fast as getting the scratchpad in Jupyter Notebooks, but at least it’s
    there! It certainly still keeps my final code cleaner, and I don’t have any cells
    sitting around that I’ve forgotten about that end up messing up the flow later
    on.

- en: 2) This opens up a side window that copies the lines from the cell you’re working
    on. If you edit code in here, it transfers to the working cell. It’s not quite
    the same as an unconnected scratchpad that I find useful for testing code. You
    have to select the pop-out window icon again.

    just like the scratchpad version in Jupyter. Now you can code away!

    shortcut to access this feature, but if you’re like me and use Scratchpad more
    than anything else, this is a viable option for if you’re using Colab. Feel free
    to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-lewis-0366146b/),
    and let me know what other extensions help in your workflow. Hopefully this one
    will help you out as you tackle some projects [similar to ones I’ve done](https://nrlewis929.medium.com/)!
