    the way we do things. This includes data pipeline design and analytics. Today
    I‚Äôd like to talk about how AI powers automated big data analysis and reporting.
    I‚Äôm sure you are familiar with Business Intelligence (BI) if you are reading this
    post. Throughout my almost 15-year career in analytics, there was a persistent
    discussion about the impact of artificial intelligence on BI. It‚Äôs quite difficult
    to say what‚Äôs bigger: AI‚Äôs BI merge and its great potential, or all the buzz around
    it. This narrative reflects my personal views and beliefs regarding the evolving
    role of AI in analytics and Business Intelligence.'

    every minute. BI as a discipline aims to analyse that data to generate insights
    that might have a certain monetary value. This in return grants a competitive
    advantage. However, BI effects on this are somewhat limited. That‚Äôs where AI comes
    into play bringing all the benefits of AI-powered enhanced process automation.
    So how does it work exactly?

    flaws that restrict the value it can provide to a business.

    for many years. The problem with it is that BI itself can‚Äôt predict data results
    and can‚Äôt create suggestions.

    a very basic linear regression exercise incorporated into a robust BI tool. It‚Äôs
    a managed feature so analysts don‚Äôt need to worry about the regression model itself.
    BI tools does it all and its AI engine has the following models under the hood:'

    problem-solving and learning (the official definition) then it becomes obvious
    how potentially significant this impact on BI might be. AI-powered BI capabilities
    can remove those limitations. We can use AI not only to understand text but also
    to understand what users might want and to generate further suggestions.

    they need. For example, in one of my previous stories I wrote that BI tools like
    **Sisense** (Simply Ask) [2] and **Thoughtspot** use AI-powered intuitive ‚ÄúGoogle-like
    search interface‚Äù [3] to get data insights from any modern data warehouse solution,
    i.e. Google Big Query, Redshift, Snowflake or Databricks.

    faster then it is a viable technological improvement worth further implementation
    into the BI process. Businesses that use artificial intelligence beat their competitors
    in terms of revenue generation and overall operational performance.

- en: Many BI tools will offer **narrative and explanation features.** How does it
    work? AI behind your report analyses all elements (fields or field combinations)
    that have caused the change in a specified point in a data collection (time, location,
    etc.) For example, it can identify that the `device category` is a possible explanation
    for a certain increase in `revenue`.

    AI can **advise** end users on what to do based on BI data. Imagine a marketing
    report with promotions and other campaigns. When the marketing team interacts
    with those insights AI can suggest how to optimize new campaigns for a particular
    audience or another promo event.

    instance, the clustering example when an AI-powered reporting solution generates
    suggestions on how to optimize retargeting for different user audiences. For example,
    with **Tableau‚Äôs Einstein Discovery** [6] enabled we will get recommendations
    for improving the predicted results. It swiftly runs through millions of rows
    of data to uncover significant correlations, forecast outcomes, and recommend
    strategies to enhance those expected results.

- en: Business Intelligence, as a concept, refers to systems that automate big data
    processing and analysis. The full value of business intelligence is recognised
    when large amounts of data are broken down into granular insights but it has certain
    limitations as a process. It helps to understand a wider business picture in a
    nutshell. With AI getting insights from your company data should be as simple
    as querying Google. AI automation is a highly welcomed business feature as businesses
    focus their efforts on building their channels and cutting overhead costs related
    to a better user experience. Companies that use artificial intelligence beat their
    competitors in terms of revenue generation and overall operational performance.
    Despite this, many firms are still lagging when it comes to incorporating AI into
    their analytics. It is a noticeable trend in the BI world where almost every solution
    tries to offer AI capabilities by bringing key model-discovered features to the
    semantic model for feature impact analysis [6]. If you are a company executive
    it is worth reading a few books on AI-powered analytics.
