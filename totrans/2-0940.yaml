    are [three common types of cloud computing](https://generativeai.pub/cloud-computing-unleashed-how-to-harness-the-power-of-cloud-for-your-business-f72e8e23be9),
    with different divisions of shared responsibility between the cloud provider and
    client. The most flexible **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** allows you to
    essentially rent empty space in the data centre. The cloud provider maintains
    the physical infrastructure and access to the internet. In contrast, the **Software-as-a-Service
    (SaaS)** model has the client renting a fully-developed software solution ran
    through the internet (think *Microsoft Office*). For enterprise data, the most
    cloud popular model is the middle ground **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** where
    the provider chooses the OS with the client able to build its data architecture
    and enterprise applications on top.'
