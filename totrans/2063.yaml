    on the *hard skills*. You might want to learn a new ML algorithm like an SVM with
    a non-linear kernel, a new software technology like MLflow, or a new AI trend
    like ChatGPT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These skills are comfortable to learn because it is **easy to measure success
    in them**. Take MLflow as an example. You might first start to learn about what
    MLflow can provide to your ML lifecycle. You learn about model artifacts, ML project
    structure, and model registration. You finish a course, spend a few hours reading
    the user guide, and even implement it in a real-life project. Great! After doing
    this, you can confidently say that you know some MLflow and can add this as a
    skillset in your CV.
  prefs: []

    the same process? Really stop and think about this. There are certainly books
    on time management you could read, but it is not nearly as concrete as reading
    the documentation on MLflow. You could implement time management in your daily
    routines, but it is not as demonstrable as implementing Mlflow in an ML project.
    You could list time management in your CV, but what does that even mean? 😧
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    nature of being less tangible**. Many people draw the conclusion that soft skills
    are less valuable than hard skills. But this is a critical mistake! Just because
    something is difficult to measure does not mean that it is not worth working on!

    to such a degree that their output was almost twice the amount of others. This
    is a boost that is almost impossible to obtain with hard skills. Nowhere have
    I ever seen someone learn MLflow, and then have twice the output of other data
    scientists. So even if soft skills are hard to measure, they can provide value
    well beyond many typically hard skills 🔥

    scientist is someone with great problem-solving capabilities. The negative stereotype

    can gain a massive advantage and use this to forge your own career path**.

    they are wrong, take a minute to actually listen. The product owner is maybe evaluated

    and also to a Power BI dashboard for internal tracking. Then both the front-end
    developers and the data analysts should be kept in the loop regarding the future
    format of the data. You might even provide them with mock data for the exact structure
    of the data. In this way, you ensure that the people that depend on you don’t

    be really good at setting models in production and monitoring for data drift.

    hand, if you simply have a lot of free-flowing code in a massive R script, then
