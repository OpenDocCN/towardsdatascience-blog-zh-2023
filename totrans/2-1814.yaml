- en: Advances in technology and the rise of data science have led to an exciting
    new era in biological research, as scientists use computational methods to gain
    a deeper understanding of the inner workings of cells. In fact, computer-based
    data analysis and mathematical modeling is today ubiquitous in chemistry, biology,
    and actually all branches of science. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular,
    have been instrumental in revealing the movements and interactions of individual
    atoms, providing crucial insights into cellular processes. However, these simulations
    have traditionally been limited to small systems due to their computational demands.
    Recent breakthroughs, as I present here, are close to enabling the first computational
    simulations of whole cells, offering a groundbreaking opportunity to model the
    tiniest complete biological units at near-atomic level. This new approach, rooted
    in pure physics, is set to revolutionize our understanding of cells and their
    complex behavior, opening up new avenues for research and discovery in data-driven
    biology. In this article, I present and discuss the mathematical modeling and
    data science behind the very first model of a protocell, on which scientists have
    sampled molecular motions and interactions inside cell-like membrane compartments
    through computer simulations; and a recent perspective article that shows how
    integrative approaches can couple -omics data with physics-based simulations to
    model the smallest cells at full complexity.

    are an incredibly powerful tool for understanding the inner workings of intracellular
    machines. These simulations allow researchers to study the movements and interactions
    of individual atoms over time, providing insights into the molecular basis of
    cellular processes. However, these simulations are extremely computationally demanding,
    so they have traditionally been limited to studying small systems, such as individual
    proteins or just relatively groups of them, as well as small sections of cell
    membranes.

    Stevens et al outline how an integrative approach can be used to model an entire
    cell at full complexity. Indeed, the researchers show how to model a minimal cell,
    called JCVI-syn3A, at full complexity. (As an interesting but side note, JCVI-syn3A
    is the minimal cell created by the J. Craig Venter Institute by stripping down
    a *Mycoplasma* bacterium, which is itself one of the smallest bacteria that we
    know about.)

    models consists in merging cryo-electron tomography images as a source of 3D information
    about intracellular architectures at low resolution with experimental or pre-simulated
    3D structures of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and metabolites, plus -omics
    data describing the numbers of molecules of each kind found in a real cell. All
    the data is put together by combining mesoscale modeling with the 3D structures
    and models, which provide high-resolution, near-atomistic information, plus quantitative
    data about intracellular processes and compositions. In the last step of the procedure,
    MARTINI models are generated for all the cellular components using various tools
    of the MARTINI software packages, and they are then put together in three dimensions
    considering their appropriate abundances as described by the -omics data.

    model of JCVI-syn3A reported in the article includes over 60,000 individual soluble
    proteins plus over 2200 protein complexes embedded in the cell envelope (“membrane”)
    and over 500 ribosomes (each of which includes several proteins and RNA molecules),
    a piece of circular DNA made up of over half a million base pairs, 1.3 million
    lipids making up the membrane, 1.7 metabolites (small molecules floating around
    the cytoplasm), and 447 million water beads plus 14 million ions that would constitute
    the “aqueous” phase inside and outside the cell model. These numbers add up to
    561 million MARTINI beads, representing around 6 billion atoms. The size of the
    resulting cell model is around 0.4 micrometers, just around that of actual JCVI-syn3A
    cells or the smallest bacterial cells.

    al discuss how such a model can be used as a starting point for the simulation
    of the spatiotemporal evolution of the cell’s interior using molecular dynamics
    simulations. They explain that having a starting model for JCVI-syn3A at hand,
    the current challenge is to perform an actual simulation to see how the system
    evolves over time. For the moment this is far from trivial, given the huge sizes
    of even these minimal cells.

    molecular dynamics simulations, which group atoms into “beads” thus making the
    systems smaller and simplifying the numbers of calculations involved in each time
    step of the simulation. One such coarse-grained model is MARTINI, which is developed
    and maintained by the group of scientists who wrote the perspective, and was recently
    used by Vermaas et al in a study published in the *Journal of Chemical Information
    and Modeling* to develop an efficient workflow for constructing still small but
    at least cell-scale membrane envelopes, and embedding membrane proteins into them.

    and around 200 nm for the larger, being around the same order of magnitude as
    the cell model built and reported in the other study. (Actually given the cubic
    scaling of volume with length, the 200 nm protocell is around 8 times smaller
    than the 400 nm, so strictly speaking this is close to one order of magnitude
    smaller… but probably this can be pardoned at the time, given the very cutting-edge
    nature of the study).

    simulation entailed around 25 million propagations of Newton’s equations of motions
    in time steps of 20 fs (femtoseconds). At each step, the program had to take the
    positions of all the beads and calculate the net force resulting on each of them
    from the interactions with all neighbors; then it had to compute the resulting
    accelerations and integrate them up to velocities and to new positions. I have

- en: Leaving that comment aside, the important point is that 500 ns is a decent amount
    of time by current standards given the system sizes, being “just” perhaps 2 two
    orders of magnitude less than what you’d normally report these days for a MARTINI
    simulation on a system of size typically used to study individual macromolecules.
    Still, 500 ns of MARTINI simulation should be enough to observe some diffusion,
    membrane stability, and certainly water permeation. Satisfyingly, the simulations
    reported by Vermaas et al showed that the membrane envelopes of their simulated
    “protocells” remained stable over time and exhibited water flux only through specific
    proteins, demonstrating the success of the methodology in creating tight cell-like
    membrane compartments. The authors also detected substantial lateral diffusion
    of proteins embedded in the cell membrane, correlating inversely with protein
    radius as expected. This diffusion resulted in the formation of (presumably) nonspecific
    interactions between adjacent membrane proteins, leading to the formation of protein
    microclusters on the cell surface. Although knowing how well this all reflects
    actual biology needs to be addressed, many proteins are indeed known to cluster
    at membranes. And it is important to stress that seeing this is in the simulations
    is enabled by their scales.

    an important step toward achieving a more complete understanding of how cells
    function, thus of great interest to biologists. When the simulation of entire
    cells becomes fully possible, researchers will be able to explore the complex
    interplay between the different cellular components and gain new insights into
    the molecular basis of cellular processes. As exemplified in the perspective article
    by Stevens et al, such simulations will bridge the gap between the hardcore data-centric
    subdisciplines of biology and bioinformatics, with the physics-centric world of
    physically realistic simulations -and with the huge amount of structural data
    generated by modern machine learning methods like AlphaFold.

    methods are developed, we can expect that someday atomic simulations of entire
    cells will be feasible, and then a few years later just commonplace. It’s not
    a matter of “if” but about “when”, and it comes together with lots of other questions
    that I won’t delve into here (for example but not limited to balancing system
    size vs. the simulation time required to actually answer the equation). Such simulations
    will open up new avenues for discovery in the field of cellular biology that are
    only science fiction today. For example, we could study if and how candidate drugs
    permeate through the membrane into the cell to reach their targets (or off-targets),
    how metabolites move around the cell, how the cytoplasm organizes, how proteins
    engage specific vs. nonspecific interactions, etc.

- en: And all this is without including any chemical reactivity (bond breaking and
    formation), which requires even more complex simulations than atomistic or coarse-grained
    ones; in fact, these so-called quantum simulations demand so much computational
    power that today we can’t even think of running them on the scales of whole cells.
    While this could someday happen, hybrid schemes that blend simulations at multiple
    levels of resolution (for example coarse-grained, atomistic, and quantum, for
    different atoms) are more likely to be applied first to whole cells; and even
    this is still quite far.

    Reading these new articles and writing this blog entry made me feel like “the
    return of basic science”, as opposed to the burst in machine learning methods
    that often outperform physics-based models but without providing obvious tangible
    clues about how they achieve such good modeling.
