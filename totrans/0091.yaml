    to change careers into Data Science, and unlike some of my coursemates, I wasn’t
    coming straight from my bachelor’s degree. I’d already been working for a few
    years since graduating, and I was entering this field with two very specific aims:'

    a difficult balancing act. In this article I’ll share 4 things that worked for
    me in the hope that they help you, too.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is that a lot of research is very theoretical, and if you’re aiming
    to go into industry after completing your degree, a lot of academic research projects
    won’t be particularly relevant to the employers you want to work for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During my bachelor’s degree, for example, I poured my heart and soul into a
    10,000 word dissertation on the foreign aid policies of Arab countries. I loved
    the project, but aside from the soft skills I honed through it (communication,
    research, etc.) it had very little relevance to any of the jobs I could get afterwards.
    The project gave me a lot of life experience, but in terms of my employability,
    I think it added very little.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result, when I started my master’s degree, I knew I wanted to take a different
    approach. Each year, my academic department at Oxford would send out a 30+ page
    booklet listing potential thesis projects we could work on, yet I knew right away
    that none of these ideas would work for me. My main aim in the degree was not
    to contribute to some esoteric academic project. It was to prepare for working
    as a Data Scientist in industry, and I knew that doing an academically interesting
    yet commercially irrelevant project wouldn’t help me towards that aim.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t get me wrong — I’ve got nothing against niche academic projects. Life’s
    about more than economic output and careers, and it enriches society to have people
    doing research even if it isn’t directly “industry-relevant.” But because I knew
    I wasn’t going to be sticking around in academia for long, I decided that my efforts
    would be best spent on trying to find a project which was *directly relevant to
    an industry use case*. If I could find one like that, I figured, the thesis could
    double up as commercial(ish) experience that I could talk about on my resumé and
    in job interviews. This would be especially valuable for me, given that I didn’t
    have any prior commercial experience in Machine Learning/Data Science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so, when the time came to start planning my thesis, I started looking for
    an industry-relevant project. How did I find a project like this? I cold-messaged
    5 people on LinkedIn who worked in Data Science/ML teams at cool companies, mentioned
    a couple of ideas about how I could contribute to some problems they might be
    working on, and asked if they’d be up for collaborating with me on a Data Science
    project. Why only 5 messages? Because that’s the limit for a non-paying, non-Premium
    LinkedIn account!
  prefs: []

- en: 'From my past experience working in Outbound Sales, I knew not to expect a high
    response rate. The people I messaged were senior members of their organisations,
    and I knew that they might not have time to help me with this kind of request.
    But that didn’t deter me: all I needed was one person willing to take a chance
    on me.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Eventually, I got a bite. A very kind person from a large(ish) US tech company
    offered to help, and he and his colleagues provided enormous amounts of support
    in helping me produce a thesis which used real-world data to tackle a commercially-relevant
    problem. The experience taught me a lot about how Data Science *actually* works
    in large organisations and I was able to talk about what I’d learned (and contributed)
    in subsequent interviews.

    project which has no relevance to your future ambitions. Find a problem faced
    by a real-world company and pitch them a solution to that problem using Data Science.
    If you can convince them that you might be able to help, they may be willing to
    provide data and a mentor to help you write a killer thesis and kill two birds
    with one stone.'

- en: If your master’s degree is one year long, I don’t think it makes sense to apply
    to jobs for at least the first 6 months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Why? Firstly, because applying to lots of jobs is a surefire way to suck the
    joy out of what you’re doing in the moment. If you’re only going to be studying
    for a year, don’t squander that time: make the most of getting stuck into your
    course and meeting new people. Enjoy it, and don’t spend all your time thinking
    about “what’s next.” Tomorrow will worry about itself.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second reason you should delay making job applications is because you’re
    unlikely to have much success at the start of your degree. Sure, you may well
    get through the first stages and be invited to interviews based on the strength
    of your academic credentials. But if you haven’t actually learned much Data Science
    yet, then you won’t have the skills to get through the technical interview stages.
    It’s much better to wait until you’ve built your knowledge and skills and have
    something more concrete to offer prospective employers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you’re thinking, “I can’t wait 6 months to apply — I need to get something
    sorted NOW!” then I really get where you’re coming from. When you’re in your final
    year of university, it can feel like there’s a lot of pressure to apply for jobs
    early on, especially given that lots of large companies typically recruit for
    roles near the start of the academic year. If that’s you, my advice would be:
    don’t let the pressure get to you. Apply when you’re ready. You will definitely
    find *something*, and if you really want to apply for a milkround job then just
    apply next year and take a gap year while you’re waiting.'

    “After all,” I reasoned to myself, “my aim in this degree is to get a good grade
    so that I’m more likely to get a good job afterwards.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thing is, however, this is really dangerous reasoning. If you only ever
    choose courses/jobs that you feel 100% comfortable doing, you’ll never really
    grow or improve your skills. You’ll get stuck in the same rut, exercising the
    same skills over and over again. Sure, you might do pretty well grades-wise. But
    you won’t grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on my experiences, my advice would be to flip the tables on this way of
    thinking and pick the modules that *scare* you. Why? Because university is a very
    unique opportunity for personal growth. Compared to working full-time in a corporate
    job, you’ve got a lot more freedom in terms of how you use your time. In my experience,
    you won’t grow much if you use this time to stay in your comfort zone. Instead,
    try some new and scary-looking courses and see what happens. Chances are, you’ll
    find out an awful lot about what you enjoy (and what you *don’t* enjoy), which
    will help you make a much more informed decision about your future.
  prefs: []

- en: In my case, this worked out pretty well. I took a scary-looking course on Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) — a course which I knew I would struggle with — but
    ended up getting much more out of it than any other course I’d taken at Oxford.
    It catapulted me into a NLP Data Scientist job immediately after I finished the
    course, and sparked a sustained interest in the field. I never would have known,
    if I’d not taken a chance on this scary-looking course in the first place.

    have a repository of projects you can showcase to employers and use to prove that
    you are a fantastic Data Scientist. If you want to take this a step further, you
    can use a no-code platform like [datascienceportfol.io](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/)
