    products. Ever faster hardware makes it possible to train ever larger machine
    learning models — in shorter times, too. With around 100 papers submitted per
    day on machine learning or related domains to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/pastweek?skip=0&show=635),
    chances are high that at least one-third of them have leveraged the hardware’s
    capabilities to do hyperparameter searches to optimize their used model. And that’s
    straightforward, is it not? Just pick a framework — [Optuna](https://optuna.org),
    [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site), whatever — plug in your normal training loop,

    the primary driving function — needs to be modified to take an additional parameter,
    the queue. We need not dive deeper here, but this queue object serves as a bridge
    to the calling function (i.e., the function that has called main(), run(), train(),
    or similar). Within the main function, we can essentially leave things as they
    are*. As is common practice in parameter searches, improving the training/evaluation
    code’s return value is the optimization practice’s target.

    Python 库，只需添加几行新代码和对现有设置进行一些更改即可实现。最后，将优化框架指向一个中间包装函数，而不是直接指向训练代码。
