  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can either learn from your experience or the experiences of others. The
    former is slow and painful, while the latter is (relatively) quick and easy. This
    is why having mentors can help accelerate progress toward your goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this all sounds great in principle, **actually finding the right mentors
    is much easier said than done**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This was something I struggled with for months. It felt like my interests were
    too niche. I was (and still am) interested in the intersection of data science
    and entrepreneurship. While I found many data scientists and entrepreneurs out
    there, it was difficult to connect with those that identify with both categories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, after months of futile cold messages on LinkedIn, there came a turning
    point when I decided to transition my search **off of LinkedIn and onto Upwork**.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those unfamiliar, Upwork is a freelancing platform where clients post jobs,
    and freelancers apply for these jobs. I first interacted with Upwork as a [freelancer
    back in grad school](https://medium.com/the-data-entrepreneurs/how-to-start-freelancing-in-data-science-150551f25fda).
    However, I came in as a client in this most recent interaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a client on Upwork, you can browse and book time with freelancers. As I explored
    the talent, I quickly realized there are *serious data scientists* on Upwork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m talking about decades of experience and 6–7F revenues on the platform (and
    that’s just on Upwork). But the real kicker is any data scientist on Upwork is,
    by default, an entrepreneur (or at least closer to one than what you’ll typically
    find on LinkedIn). So it seemed I had found my niche mentors.

    I structured the calls in 3 parts: Past — how did you get started?, Present —
    how do you operate now?, and Future — where is this going?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from these conversations. I hope this gives you some context and inspiration for
    what your data entrepreneurship journey can look like.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most striking observations from these calls is that no two data science
    freelancer journeys were the same. Just to give a sense of this, here are the
    educational backgrounds of the 10 freelancers I spoke with *Biomedical Engineering,
    Industrial Engineering, Biostatistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science,
    Finance, Physics, Data Science, Marketing, AI, Economics, Math, MBA, and DS Bootcamp*.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that draws a wide range of perspectives and experiences, which makes for very
    interesting conversation and collaboration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    backgrounds extends to how freelancers operate and where they are headed. Put
    simply, ***different is the norm here*.**

- en: '**How did you start freelancing?**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While each freelancer’s start was unique, there was a common starting strategy
    that came up a few times. In the early days, many freelancers tended to have a
    **strong focus on learning and reputation building**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is more to data science freelancing than just the “hands-on-keyboard”
    work. Not only do you need to do data science, but you also need to sell yourself,
    juggle clients, manage your financials, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common way freelancers navigated this was to take on a (relatively) high volume
    of small projects in the early days. Not only does this provide several repetitions
    to learn from, but having a long list of successfully completed projects (with
    testimonials) creates credibility and makes it easier to get new clients.
  prefs: []

- en: While this “small-and-wide” strategy was great for getting started, it did not
    seem to be a common (or good) long-term strategy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In keeping with the “*different is the norm*” theme, there was a wide mix of
    how these freelancers currently worked and got paid. Here are a few examples to
    give you an idea of this.

    their work to what works best for them.
  prefs: []

- en: For those who were not seeking full-time work, it was common to limit the weekly
    time commitment for each client. 10 hr/week per client seemed to be a sweet spot,
    with a typical variation between 5–20 hr/week. With this time allotment, freelancers
    would typically have 2–3 clients at a time.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There were **3 common ways the freelancers got new clients**. The **first**
    and most common way was applying for contracts on Upwork or other sites.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **second** way was via inbound leads (i.e. clients found them) on Upwork
    or other platforms. This occurred most often for those with a great reputation,
    a list of testimonials, or a strong presence on social media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the **third** way (which was common for the most successful freelancers)
    was getting work from referrals alone. This seemed to happen when there was much
    more demand from clients than the freelance could supply (which also naturally
    drove up prices.)

  prefs:

- en: Each freelancer had a unique vision for their future. However, to make this
    more digestible, here I partition the long-term goals into 3 buckets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Keep Freelancing & Scale Up Consulting Business**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first bucket includes the ones that can see themselves **freelancing forever**.
    They enjoy it, and it gives them a nice life. They work when they want, on what
    they want, with who they want, and where they want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, in this bucket, I put the ones who want to **scale up their consulting
    business**. This tends to happen organically for those who have too much work
    than they can do alone and who enjoy project management. For many, this is as
    simple as having subcontractors that they work with frequently or even full-time
    employees.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Generate Passive Income & Build a Product-Oriented Company**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although freelancing provides tremendous freedom and can be lucrative, it still
    mainly consists of trading time for money *e.g. I pay you an hourly rate to do
    a job*. While this isn’t so bad, most would rather trade a little time for a lot
    of money *e.g. you build a product once and sell it many times*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is the second long-term goal bucket which lumps together generating passive
    income with building a product-oriented business. While these are technically
    different, they both can serve the same purpose: **generating more value in less
    time**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some freelancers planned to do this by creating online courses or other digital
    products. A handful of freelancers were actively building trading bots or other
    trading tools for personal use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Others considered building software solutions tailored to mid-size companies
    or specific industries by leveraging their freelance experience and clientele.
    While I haven’t yet personally seen a successful realization of this latter idea,
    I am optimistic about it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While freelancing offers flexibility and independence, some freelancers may
    eventually transition into full-time roles. Some even consistently cycle in and
    out of full-time roles. A few reasons for this from those that I interviewed were:
    you can make a bigger impact at an enterprise, more social interaction and collaboration,
    more certainty and income stability, greater opportunities for career growth,
    and a client becomes an employer.'

    helped accelerate progress toward my goals. While it’s hard to say how things
    will turn out, I have a feeling this may be **one of the best investments I made
    in my entrepreneurship journey**. I’m looking forward to putting these learnings
    into practice and continuing to build relationships with others in this space.

    mind for future freelancing endeavors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Do good work so you can operate on reputation and referrals**. If people
    come to you, you have greater leverage and optionality to help ensure the work
    and clients you take on are aligned with your goals.'

    pond. Here are some niches that came up in my interviews: finance, crypto, energy,
    OCR, LLM applications, and data strategy.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Form alliances across the tech stack**. Data science work alone can be limited
    in its business impact and value generation. This is why forming relationships
    with other specialists (e.g. SWE, web dev, UX/UI, etc.) can help you provide greater
    value to your clients.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Develop a personal brand**. Having a strong brand presence on social media
    platforms can make it easier to land freelance contracts by giving you credibility.
    Additionally, sharing valuable content and showcasing your expertise can help
    ideal clients find you (as opposed to you having to find them).'
