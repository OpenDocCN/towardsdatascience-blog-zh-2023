    As a data scientist with business acumen, you should already have a good idea
    — but it’s important for this step to engage your stakeholders and leverage their

    to a specific customer accurately mirrors recent changes in their behavior or
    profile. The frequency of recalculating these segments depends on how rapidly
    the associated dimensions can change. For a supermarket where customer shop several
    times a week, re-calculating the segments weekly might make sense — especially
    if it coincide with weekly marketing efforts and decisions. For an online retailer
    where most customers shop a couple times a year, a monthly cadence of segment
    refresh could be more fitting.
