    data is much easier said than done.

- en: I remember back when I was studying for my master’s in Data Science, a little
    over a year ago. Throughout the course, I found that coming up with project ideas
    was the easy part — it was *finding good datasets* that I struggled with the most.
    I would spend hours scouring the internet, pulling my hair out trying to find
    juicy data sources and getting nowhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since then, I’ve come a long way in my approach, and in this article I want
    to share with you the 5 strategies that I use to find datasets. If you’re bored
    of standard sources like Kaggle and FiveThirtyEight, these strategies will enable
    you to get data that are unique and much more tailored to the specific use cases
    you have in mind.

    technical name (“synthetic data generation”).

    synthetic data is a fantastic way to get original and tailored datasets.

    — a model that can predict how likely a customer is to leave a company. Churn
    is a pretty common “operational problem” faced by many companies, and tackling
    a problem like this is a great way to show recruiters that you can use ML to solve
    commercially-relevant problems, as I’ve argued previously:'

    are (at the time of writing) only two main datasets obviously available to the
    public: the [Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset),
    and the [Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets).
    These datasets are a fantastic place to start, but might not reflect the kind
    of data required for modelling churn in other industries.'

- en: Of course, ChatGPT is limited in the speed and size of the datasets it can create,
    so if you want to upscale this technique I’d recommend using either the Python
    library `faker` or scikit-learn’s `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` and `sklearn.datasets.make_regression`
    functions. These tools are a fantastic way to programmatically generate huge datasets
    in the blink of an eye, and perfect for building proof-of-concept models without
    having to spend ages searching for the perfect dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, I have rarely needed to use synthetic data creation techniques
    to generate *entire* datasets (and, as I will explain later, you’d be wise to
    exercise caution if you intend to do this). Instead, I find this is a really neat
    technique for generating adversarial examples or adding noise to your datasets,
    enabling me to test my models’ weaknesses and build more robust versions. But,
    regardless of how you use this technique, it’s an incredibly useful tool to have
    at your disposal.

    the type of data you’re looking for, but the obvious problem is that you’ve got
    no guarantee that the data are good representations of real-life populations.

    is, surprise surprise…

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way of doing this is to reach out to companies that might hold such data
    and ask if they’d be interested in sharing some with you. At risk of stating the
    obvious, no company is going to give you data that are highly sensitive or if
    you are planning to use them for commercial or unethical purposes. That would
    just be plain stupid.
  prefs: []

- en: However, if you intend to use the data for research (e.g., for a university
    project), you might well find that companies are open to providing data if it’s
    in the context of a *quid pro quo* joint research agreement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'What do I mean by this? It’s actually pretty simple: I mean an arrangement
    whereby they provide you with some (anonymised/de-sensitised) data and you use
    the data to conduct research which is of some benefit to them. For example, if
    you’re interested in studying churn modelling, you could put together a proposal
    for comparing different churn prediction techniques. Then, share the proposal
    with some companies and ask whether there’s potential to work together. If you’re
    persistent and cast a wide net, you will likely find a company that is willing
    to provide data for your project *as long as you share your findings with them*
    so that they can get a benefit out of the research.'

    is exactly what I did during my master’s degree](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/4-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-data-science-degree-40815f6a311d).
    I reached out to a couple of companies with a proposal for how I could use their
    data for research that would benefit them, signed some paperwork to confirm that
    I wouldn’t use the data for any other purpose, and conducted a really fun project
    using some real-world data. It really can be done.

- en: The other thing I particularly like about this strategy is that it provides
    a way to exercise and develop quite a broad set of skills which are important
    in Data Science. You have to communicate well, show commercial awareness, and
    become a pro at managing stakeholder expectations — all of which are essential
    skills in the day-to-day life of a Data Scientist.

    Kaggle, but are still publicly available for use by other researchers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways to find datasets like these is by looking in the repositories
    associated with academic journal articles. Why? Because lots of journals require
    their contributors to make the underlying data publicly available. For example,
    two of the data sources I used during my master’s degree (the [Fragile Families](https://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/)
    dataset and the [Hate Speech Data](https://github.com/leondz/hatespeechdata) website)
    weren’t available on Kaggle; I found them through academic papers and their associated
    code repositories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How can you find these repositories? It’s actually surprisingly simple — I start
    by opening up [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/), search for papers
    in the area I’m interested in, and look at the available datasets until I find
    something that looks interesting. In my experience, this is a really neat way
    to find datasets which haven’t been done-to-death by the masses on Kaggle.

    There are literally *hundreds* of datasets covering everything from Google Search
    Trends to London Bicycle Hires to Genomic Sequencing of Cannabis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things I especially like about this source is that lots of these
    datasets are incredibly commercially relevant. You can kiss goodbye to niche academic
    topics like flower classification and digit prediction; in BigQuery, there are
    datasets on real-world business issues like ad performance, website visits and
    economic forecasts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lots of people shy away from these datasets because they require SQL skills
    to load them. But, even if you don’t know SQL and only know a language like Python
    or R, I’d still encourage you to take an hour or two to learn some basic SQL and
    then start querying these datasets. It doesn’t take long to get up and running,
    and this truly is a treasure trove of high-value data assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use the datasets in BigQuery Public Datasets, you can sign up for a completely
    free account and create a sandbox project by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox).
    You don’t need to enter your credit card details or anything like that — just
    your name, your email, a bit of info about the project, and you’re good to go.
    If you need more computing power at a later date, you can upgrade the project
    to a paid one and access GCP’s compute resources and advanced BigQuery features,
    but I’ve personally never needed to do this and have found the sandbox to be more
    than adequate.

    than using generic search engines as you’re often provided with metadata about
    the datasets and you have the ability to rank them by how often they’ve been used
    and the publication date. Quite a nifty approach, if you ask me.
