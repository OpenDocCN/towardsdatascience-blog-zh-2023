    using the ChatGPT system. In almost all cases, the generated chords were at least
    decent and sometimes very good, but the generated melodies were always bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of text on the Internet showing songs with chords and discussions of chord progressions.
    Conversely, only a few sites show melodies in ABC or any other text-based format.
    As a result, it generally knows what a melody is and clearly understands the ABC
    format, but apparently, this is not enough for the system to compose decent melodies.

    used in rock and pop music. The bridge adds some variety to the song by using
    a different progression, the iii — ii — V — I progression, which adds a sense
    of contrast and can help to build excitement and tension leading into the final
    chorus.

- en: The results here seem good, too. However, note that the system is again confused
    about which chords are dominant and which are minor. In the Roman numeral format,
    uppercase letters indicate major chords, and lowercase letters indicate minor
    chords. The chords for the bridge part were specified as “G#m — **F#** — B — E
    (iii — **ii** — V — I),” where the ii chord should be F# minor, but it shows as
    F# major. It did get the G# minor chord correct. I decided to roll with the mistake,
    but I asked the system to use 7th chords, often used in both country and rock
    music. I just needed to ask.

    7th chords, which add a bit more complexity and color to the chords. The 7th chords
    add a sense of tension and dissonance, which can be particularly effective in
    a country rock context.

    lead melody, which is common in country rock. The guitar work was particularly
    lovely, although using a pedal steel guitar would have been fitting. And the chords
    from ChatGPT worked well once again. To my ears, the bridge part is the piece's
    highlight, despite (or maybe because of) the erroneously dominant F#7 chord.

- en: As I have shown, ChatGPT knows a lot about music theory and can generate chord
    progressions for various styles of music and provide color commentary for its
    choices. It can also take feedback to create variations of the composed songs
    and provide additional comments. It occasionally makes mistakes, like giving contradictory
    and seemingly incorrect recommendations for chords. But the results sounded just
    fine in the two cases where that happened.
