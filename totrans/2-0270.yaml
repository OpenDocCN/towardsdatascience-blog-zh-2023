    of “catness” that the AI model has learned from its training data, a mind-boggling
    number of cat photos you wish you had but you can’t afford. It’s just like all
    that [statsy stuff involving simulating from statistical distributions](http://bit.ly/quaesita_sims),
    and it comes with many of the same pros and cons, plus the added con that you
    don’t actually know much about the distribution you’re drawing cats from.*

    (even if it’s processed by someone else) that you couldn’t afford to acquire yourself.
    Thanks to recent progress in AI, the machine-made fakes are pretty darned convincing
    to a human. Unfortunately, even if they look convincing to *you*, when it comes
    to using them for [training](http://bit.ly/quaesita_mrbean) your own AI systems,
    they might have a fatal flaw you’re unable to see with your naked eye…
