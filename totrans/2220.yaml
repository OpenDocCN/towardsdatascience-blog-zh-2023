    of our decisions can lead to considerable economic and social impacts, the research
    on decision-making was highly interdisciplinary from the beginning. Scientists
    from mathematics, sociology, psychology, economics, political science, and computer
    science have been actively studying how to make better decisions since the mid-20th
    century. Among the many achievements in these fields, the most well-known are
    the expected utility, prospect, and game theories. These theories are driven by
    mathematical models but often face challenges from empirical tests of real-world
    scenarios.

    technologies, decision support systems (DSS) have advanced in parallel with the
    decision theories to assist humans in making decisions, particularly in the business
    and organizational context. A typical DSS includes scalable knowledge databases
    to collect and store large amounts of information, statistical and analytical
    algorithms for forecasting and projection, and user interfaces (including charts
    and dashboards) for human decision-makers to visualize and interact with the decision-making
    process.

    and error. The iterative approach is particularly effective in dealing with unknowns
    in a novel environment. It requires explorations for new information and assessments
    of errors to refine decision-making. Remarkably, deep reinforcement learning has
    emulated the trial-and-error nature of human decision-making and surpassed human
    players in specific games.

    examples of AI and deep learning revolutionizing the decision-making field. We
    now find ourselves in an era where AI provides the foundation to bring all decision-making
    disciplines together, fastens the pace of understanding the human decision-making
    process, and further empowers humans to make data-driven rational decisions.

    consequences. Plenty of stories in the literature and our daily lives have taught

    theories have focused on how the alternatives are evaluated and how humans make
    the final choice, based on the assumption that each option should have an expected
    value for a purpose. In the biological world, the value could be to reduce hunger,
    thirst, or other basic survival needs. In many different situations, it could
    be a reward or punishment. The most straightforward value for a financial or economic
    decision is the money earned or lost.

    Bernoulli back in 1713 and was later finalized by other economists and mathematicians
    in the 20th century. The theory proposes that a rational agent should choose the
    option with the maximum expected utility. The expected utility is the weighted
    average of all the probable utility levels an action is expected to reach under
    specific circumstances. In essence, the utility reflects both the expected value
    and the risk a person will get for a choice.

    ensure people make choices consistent with their goals. It also takes into account
    diminishing marginality, in which when the value of money increases, the extent
    of utility increase slows down (e.g., a wealthy person has a lower desire for
    an extra hundred dollars than a poor person).

- en: In 1979, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky challenged the expected
    utility theory with their experimental findings. Their research revealed that
    people do not consistently choose the maximum utility but have the propensity
    for more risk-aversive or risk-seeking options depending on the relativity of
    the value and risk. The discoveries led to the development of the prospect theory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the same example above, most participants choose option 1 for scenario
    1 because $450 is guaranteed with 100% probability. For scenario 2, most people
    choose the risker option 2 even though its utility value ($550) indicates more
    loss than the other option. In other words, people prefer smaller utility gains
    to avoid risks but are willing to take more risks when facing losses.

    for both gains and losses in the expected utility theory, the prospect theory
    has an asymmetrical S-shaped curve with the negative utility curve significantly
    steeper than the positive part of the curve (see the picture below). In a nutshell,
    the expected utility theory is about what people should do to make a rational
    choice of the maximum utility. In contrast, the prospect theory explains why people
    tend to make worse decisions due to their preference for avoiding immediate losses
    instead of achieving long-term gains.

    to our human mind. The value could depend on well-being or other psychological
    or social factors. Furthermore, in many cases, we have yet to determine the probability
    of each outcome. A general challenge for the decision theories is that they all
    have assumptions only suitable to the particular field and have been tested using
    small samples. In addition, the expected value and probability are not static
    but depend on many factors and could be relative to other options. Decision-makers
    must re-evaluate the utilities every time those factors or options change.

    from phase 3\. Humans can assign the expected value, find the maximum utility,
    and act immediately. In many other situations, however, the best option is not
    apparent or available after the evaluations. We often encounter situations where
    the two choices provide equal value in a complementary or competing way, and the
    cost seems comparable when choosing one versus the other. The typical dilemma
    could make it challenging to decide or make the decision-making process stand
    still. It is when people seek help from others (e.g., family members or friends)
    or leverage social groups to decide. When there are multiple decision-makers for
    a specific problem, game theory has been developed to address this type of dilemma
    in decision-making (note: game theory is a vital field in social decision-making,
    but beyond the scope of the current article.)'

    facing a novel problem, humans must go through the typical four decision-making
    phases described above. However, our human mind often struggles to rationalize
    a complex situation due to our brain capacity limit and potential biases. Since
    the mid-20th century, decision support systems (DDS) emerged to extend the human
    capacity to support decision-makers in making better decisions. The main features

    the aspects that they pay attention to while ignoring many details deemed irrelevant
    in the first place. The acquired short-term memories then gradually decay if without
    use, and only a small portion is stored for the long term. Sometimes, even when
    a fact is stored in the brain, humans may experience difficulty in finding it
    (e.g., a search problem.)
  prefs: []

    have a separate place to store different instances of our experience. It uses
    the same brain areas that initially recorded and processed the information to
    store the memory. Whenever we recall or replay it mentally, the same neural network
    is activated, and the synapses’ weights are adjusted. In addition, because of
    the neural network’s pattern recognition and associative nature, our brain can
    automatically fill in details that were not recorded or observed initially. It
    explains the framing effects of how initial questions asked and implicit suggestions
    during problem-solving can distort people’s memory and impact their decision-making.

    choices. Given this, data analytics can help alleviate the impact of emotions

    related to those types of “unknowns” in this famous line stated by the former
    US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (at a press conference in 2002). If everything
    is known (known knowns), no more decisions are necessary since the outcome is
    already determined. The “known unknowns” are represented by the probabilities
    and risks for the options, which are used in the utility functions to identify
    the optimal choice with the maximum utility. However, the “unknown unknowns” underscore
    the uncertainty of the outcomes that cannot be predicted or forecasted given the
    existing knowledge and experience. They can only be identified or discovered after
    specific actions occur.

    It is how humans become the masters of anything they do, including decision-making.
    Because of this mode of iterative learning, most of our choices are automated:
    some are fully wired by nature, such as reflexes (e.g., withdrawing hands from
    a fire, blinking to avoid an intense light beam), and others are the results of
    learning from training (e.g., win a game, fly an airplane).'

    deep neural networks to RL, which enabled the model to learn a game from scratch

    in this article. Within the model, an agent makes observations, evaluates optimal
    paths, takes actions, and receives feedback through rewards from the environment.
    Subsequently, the agent compares its anticipated rewards with the actual rewards
    and uses the difference to fine-tune its next round of actions. With the iterative
    adjustments over time, it will act in a way that maximizes the rewards. It’s worth
    noting that RL uses the term “reward” instead of “utility” because the computation
    of rewards diverges from the utility calculations in the utility theories.
