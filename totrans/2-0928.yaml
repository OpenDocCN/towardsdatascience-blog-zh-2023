    gained more than 2K followers on Medium, and recently launched my first e-book

    work sometimes already recognize me just because of my blog.

    as a domain expert. It gives my online profile a visibility that I couldn’t get
    otherwise.
  prefs: []

- en: This visibility opened up several career opportunities for me in the past, including
    my gig as Applied Scientist with Amazon in 2019, and my recent career transition
    to Machine Learning Engineering at Meta in 2022\. In both cases, recruiters discovered
    me online, not the other way around.

- en: Additional income streams are a hedge. As we’ve seen in the 2022/2023 large-scale
    tech layoffs, no job is secure, not even fancy ML roles. One of my writing goals
    has always been to create multiple additional income streams, making myself less
    dependent on a single paycheck.

    in proportion to how much time readers spend on them, much like Spotify pays artists.
    In addition, if your writing is good, Medium’s recommendation algorithms will
    distribute it to more readers, creating more engagement and therefore more royalties.

    has grown over the years as I kept learning, trying out new things, and improving.
    My most popular piece, “[Algorithms are not enough](/algorithms-are-not-enough-fdee1d65e536)”,
    has made me close to $500 in royalties. Land 2 such pieces a week, and you’re
    starting to look at a pretty sizable income stream.

    especially so in companies with a strong culture around the written narrative,
    such as Amazon. Jeff Bezos famously [banned](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-its-arguably-smartest-management-move-that-hes-ever-made.html)

    today happens not synchronously in the office, but asynchronously and remote.
    Sitting in my Seattle home office, I may work with some collaborators in the Bay
    Area, some in New York City, and some in the UK, and the best way to get everyone
    on the same page is with a shared document containing a written narrative. Good
    writing has become a cornerstone for collaboration in the post-COVID, hybrid/remote
    work environment.

    enjoying it. The experience of starting with a blank page and filling it with
    content is satisfying to me, and even more so once I see how users engage with
    that content. It’s creative work, and I love it.

    for me — none of the other reasons would be sufficient. As with anything in life,
    passion is the most important ingredient to keep going.
