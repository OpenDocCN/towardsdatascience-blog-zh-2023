    a Google Form I made to collect data on myself, tracking items such as whether
    I cried, exercised, drank coffee, or washed my hair. I also collected data from
    Apple Health and Google Location History to get a more complete picture of my
    patterns and behaviors throughout the year. In this article, I provide insights
    into my personal experiences in 2022 through a combination of all of this data

    York, started a new job, and traveled to many cities. To reflect on the year that
    just happened in a proper data scientist fashion, I combined all of this data
    and analyzed it to understand my patterns of crying — where I cried, when I cried,
    how often I cried, and a tiny bit of insight into why I cried. The hope is that
    these insights will prepare me for many more days of crying to come in the New
    Year. (Note: these analyses are purely for fun and are not meant to be very rigorous.
    No statistical claims are made).'

    live), Toronto (where my partner lives), Seattle (where my work is), visiting
    my parents, and traveling. Nearly 36% of my crying days were in Toronto. Even
    accounting for the fact that I spent 49 days in Toronto (compared to 239 in New
    York), I cried way more often in Toronto than anywhere else.

    and February 2022 there — not only was it excruciatingly cold, but Toronto was
    *still under lockdown at that time*. So that might explain why I spent so much
    time crying in Toronto. There was nothing else to do.

    days I exercised. Above is a breakdown of types of exercise I did in different
    locations. I did martial arts (Muay Thai, boxing, and a singular Wing Chun class)
    mostly in New York and Toronto while I did more cardio (running, biking, hiking)
    during my visits to Seattle or to see my parents. Days of dancing (salsa, hip
    hop), walking (a catch-all for days I walked over 10K steps but didn’t log a specific
    workout), and other exercise (including yoga, home workouts, and going to the
    normal gym) are sprinkled among the different locations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I calculated the percent of days I spent crying on days I did certain exercises,
    relative to total days I did that exercise. At first sight, it looks like I cried
    way more on days I went dancing. But in reality, I only went dancing 8 days in
    the entire year, so the fact that I cried 2 of those days is not a strong enough
    indicator that dancing causes crying (or vice versa, that crying causes dancing?
    Although that would be pretty funny).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, I cried the least on days I did martial arts. This makes
    sense, given that a large reason I go to the boxing gym is to get all of my rage
    and frustration out. Even if the correlation is spurious, it’s still a good reason
    to keep doing what I’m doing.

    monthly cycles affect mood, hormonal health, and so much more. I was curious about
    what part of my cycle I cried more during. Anecdotally, it felt like I was always
    crying before my period started, so I hypothesized that I would see a lot more
    crying happening right before my period started.

- en: A large part of crying happens on Day 16 of my period. This is usually right
    after ovulation happens, and this makes given that a lot of hormonal fluctuation
    is happening then. I also cried a lot on Days 21 and 22, which is about a week
    before my period starts and usually when I feel the worst PMS. I cried the least
    on Days 13 and 15 (right before ovulation) and Days 5, 8, and 9 (the first few
    days after the menstrual phase ended).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, the reality is not as clear-cut as “I cry a lot before my period.” I cry
    during *all* parts of my 28-day cycle, but not equally on each day. I cry *more*
    on days of greater hormonal fluctuations, such as right after ovulation and a
    before the menstrual phase begins again. But I now know to keep in mind that the
    time after ovulation is one especially susceptible to tears.

    two principle components only explained 7% of the entire variance, which is not
    very high). At first glance, there didn’t seem to be much of a clear distinction
    between the embeddings for days I cried vs. days I didn’t cry. Perhaps this is
    because the reasons for crying vary differently for each instance and it is likely
    I didn’t write about crying in similar ways each time it happened.'

    In the test data, there were only 12 days of crying (out of 72 days). This is
    an example of an imbalanced class, in which there are way more days of not crying
    than crying. In terms of modeling, I kept things simple as possible. I used an
    out-of-the-box [Gradient Boosting Classifier from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html).

    results of each classifier. The first model (trained without embeddings) was more
    likely to predict a day as crying, even if it wasn’t. The second model (trained
    with embeddings) did not incorrectly predict a day as crying, but it also missed
    most of the actual days of crying. The two models did not differ greatly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of this to say — neither model was very good at actually detecting actual
    days of crying. It’s easy to get a high accuracy by just predicting “not crying”
    for every day, due to the data imbalance (there were many more days of not crying
    than crying). However, it’s difficult (at least with this early stage of modeling
    without doing anything fancy) to make any simplistic conclusions about clear indicators
    for crying. My journal entries, especially, did not give clear indications for
    crying. This further supports the idea that each crying session is varied in its
    cause, type, and essence. Predicting whether or not I’ll cry on a given day is
    pretty difficult!
