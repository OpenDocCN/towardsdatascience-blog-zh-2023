- en: I’ve had multiple positions as a data scientist in different organizations and
    companies since graduating from a Dutch university in the data science field.
    What has surprised me and some other graduates is the gap between the skills you
    are taught at university and the skills required to be a valuable data science
    employee. In this article, I’d like to highlight the four biggest gaps in skills
    taught at uni and skills I’ve found necessary to perform well as a data science
    employee.

- en: At university it is often common to work ‘Notebook-style’, using Jupyter Notebooks.
    The most solid project structure I set up at uni was calling different modules
    from a *main.py* file and using a *requirements.txt.* But using a *setup.py*?
    Or a *pyproject.toml*? Nope.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The requirements companies want from a data science project are much different.
    Your data science project should often be built as an installable package, e.g.
    through `pip install <package_name>`. A *requirements.txt* is sometimes necessary,
    but at least the package’s dependencies should be specified in the *pyproject.toml*
    (nowadays preferred over *setup.py,* see[PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next to being installable, your data science project should often be able to
    run as a Docker container-based API in the cloud. By calling your API using REST
    requests, data can be processed through pipelines or even predicted with a Machine
    Learning model.
