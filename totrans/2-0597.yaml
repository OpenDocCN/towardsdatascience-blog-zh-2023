    publish your resume on website to stand out or create your own blog website. Possibilities
    are endless. There is a simple, fast and most importantly free way to host a static
    website without knowing little to no previous web experience leveraging prebuilt
    themes. In this post, I will show how to do just that.

    these themes. While we can build websites fairly quickly using these themes with
    minimal simple customisation, it is worth mentioning that the more customisation
    we want to make, the more web development experience and time will be needed.
    In our example, we will pick one of these prebuilt themes and slightly customise
    it together. Simple changes like replacing sample content with your content will
    be as simple as replacing text in any software.
