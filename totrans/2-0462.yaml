    Github Actions is a platform from Github with which one can automate workflows,
    and is commonly used for CI/CD (continuous integration / delivery) pipelines —
    e.g. to automatically run unit tests when wanting to merge a new PR. Since these
    pipelines are run frequently, and their execution time can grow significantly,
    it makes sense to see where to save time — and caching action outputs is one such
    method.

    is quite brief and leaves some questions unanswered — thus I here wanted to shed
    a bit more light into this. We begin by a short introduction to Github Actions
    and how caching works, and then demonstrate this using two examples: the first
    follows the original toy example about creating prime numbers, while the second
    one is more realistic — we cache a full Python environment.'

    I introduced this topic in more details — thus here we will just briefly cover
    this, and I would like to refer to the linked article for details. However, in
    summary Github Actions allows to automatize workflows, often used for CI/CD pipelines,
    e.g. for running unit tests, checking style guides etc. After receiving certain
    trigger events, runners (which can be hosted by Github or custom ones) pick up
    jobs consisting of different steps. Let’s use an example from the previous post
    for demonstration:'

    version. The job has different steps, which checkout the repo, setup Python, and
    output different messages.

    the repository is mostly checked out freshly, meaning every time the set environment
    has to be installed anew. Thus, here we show how to cache this environment — meaning
    instead of downloading and installing the packages, the full environment is cached
    and downloaded from the cache. In particular, this example will show the usage
    of [poetry](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/dependency-management-with-poetry-f1d598591161),
