- en: With the technological advances of recent years, especially since the turn of
    the millennium, data science has become a discipline in its own right, separate
    from computer science and more closely aligned to statistics. It has carved out
    a niche for itself where data scientists apply themselves to solving business
    problems that rely on the access, processing and ultimately the interpretation
    of data.
  prefs: []

- en: This demands a particular skillset such as a good understanding of programming
    languages, for example Python and R, to help simplify analytics workflows required
    to access large disparate data sets. The data scientist’s skillset combined with
    that of the economist delivers a winning formula for those looking to distinguish
    themselves from the herd and master modern economics.

    of Economics [1] has extended its curriculum in recent years to include an undergraduate
    degree titled the BSc Data Science and Business Analytics, with the strapline
    promising learners that they would “learn to analyse data to address real world-problems”,
    real-world problems which are naturally based in economic and business relations.

    [2] and the joint-winner of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences,
    Paul Romer, is a proponent of Jupyter Notebook, an open source web application
    which allows users to create and share documents including live code, equations
    and visualisations to support interactive computing across multiple programming
    languages. This final remark is at the core of Jupyter, the name Jupyter being
    an acronym meaning Julia, Python and R, all three being programming languages.

    volumes — no pun intended — and it clearly indicates the direction of travel.
    As Romer noted on a blogpost back in 2018: “Jupyter rewards transparency; Mathematica
    rationalizes secrecy. Jupyter encourages individual integrity; Mathematica lets
    individuals hide behind corporate evasion”. [3] Here he is comparing Jupyter with
    a competing platform, Mathematica, however if we look beyond the descriptives
    it is quite clear that Romer strongly identifies with the benefits and possibilities
    which data science brings to the forefront.'

    the UK is approaching its three year anniversary of adopting its post-Brexit EU-UK
    relationship, working according to its newly imposed trade regulations.

    single market on June 23rd 2016, it took over four years as part of a transition
    period lasting up to 31st December 2021 before the agreed changes were implemented.

    as a key factor in the success or demise of the UK economy, there are now several
    other factors which have joined the party which conveniently muddies the waters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the late arrivals to the party is of course the Covid pandemic. Considering
    this human tragedy purely through a financial lens, Covid led to an unprecedented
    halt in consumer spending and in turn an increase in the average household’s savings,
    largely brought on in response to office workers transitioning to working from
    home, all social and leisure arrangements including travel being postponed indefinitely.

    time when the financial system was already overheated with 0% interest rates thereby
    limiting options for monetary acrobatics to help ease the economy into a recovery.

- en: That covers two factors, Brexit followed by Covid. As if that wasn’t enough,
    along came the energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine-Russia conflict which started
    with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the 24th February 2022\. Again, purely considering
    this humanitarian disaster through an economic lens, the conflict led to the demand
    for energy outstripping supply and in turn the prices of all impacted consumer
    goods rocketing.

    storm which will demand all parties to pull together to sail us through the choppy
    waters ahead.

- en: With both data science and economics being built on statistics, the key distinction
    is that data science tends to focus more on predicting future interaction between
    variables whilst economics tends to focus more on the historic interaction i.e.
    forward looking vs backward looking, prediction vs causality.

    leading up to 2023, data and visuals supplied via the Office of National Statistics
    [4]. It clearly highlights that whilst all G7 members’ trade plummeted during
    the pandemic years of 2020–2022, they all recovered to pre-pandemic levels, bouncing
    back strongly with exception to the UK which is still lagging behind other members,
    as illustrated in the visual below:'

    in relation to its other six G7 counterparts, a valid statement as at Q2 2022\.
    Rather than promoting trade relations outside of the EU as argued by Brexiteers
    with the run up to the referendum, it appears that the UK’s trade openness, in
    layman’s terms its ability to trade, is in fact reducing, insights supported by
    data science.

    of inflation, the target being to contain it under 2%. As of October 2023 the
    UK inflation is set at 4.6%. [5]

    Analyst within Investment Management, it’s evident that data science and economics
    disciplines are closely interlinked, data science effectively serving as a key
    pillar of economics and the decisions it drives and supports.

    rewards by leveraging new technologies and data interrogation methods available
    on the market today and everything points to this being a trend which is still
    in its formative years.
