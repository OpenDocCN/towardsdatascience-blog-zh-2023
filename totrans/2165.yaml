- en: In the world of statistics and data analysis, hypothesis testing is a fundamental
    concept that plays a vital role in making informed decisions. In this blog, we
    will delve deeper into [**hypothesis testing**](https://medium.com/geekculture/what-is-hypothesis-testing-in-statistics-motivation-and-interpretation-39f8e63b1baf),
    specifically focusing on how to reduce type I and type II errors. We will discuss
    the factors that influence these errors, such as significance level, sample size,
    and data variability. So, let’s dive in and explore the intricacies of hypothesis
    testing!

    information you have about the population. This means that the precision of the

    have a smaller probability of committing a type I error.

    be more difficult to detect a true effect. In other words, the probability of
    a type I error increases. This is because the test statistic has a larger spread
    and it’s harder to distinguish between the null hypothesis and the alternative
    hypothesis.
