    and unexpected. Energy providers need the data to make sure power throughput will
    meet demand when thousands of AC units on their grid turn. Demand for Citibike
    rides in New York City drops dramatically when it starts raining. Retailers even
    use weather data to target cold and flu medicine advertising at consumers during
    unseasonably cold weather.

- en: A vast amount of weather data is collected by governments and academic institutions,
    meaning that when it comes to building analyses and models, the data you need
    is often available for free. This is particularly true in the US where data collected
    by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes
    the National Weather Service (NWS), is public domain.
  prefs: []

- en: The problem with much of this high-quality free data is that it’s buried in
    hard to find, antiquated hosting areas, FTP servers, or two pages deep into Google
    behind a whole slew of private companies. For example, much of NOAA’s data is
    only available through a shopping cart process where you may need to know the
    exact datasets you want before you even start looking. The difficulty in accessing
    these data means your easiest options are usually private data providers with
    APIs and high search rankings. Those sources can be great, but typically have
    free tiers with prohibitively strict rate limits, historical time limits, resolution
    limits, etc. So, to help you in your data search, I’ve put together five high
    quality and reliable data sources that are, most importantly, free.

- en: NCEI, under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), offers
    access to one of the most significant archives for environmental data on Earth.
    They provide comprehensive information on atmospheric, coastal, oceanic, and geophysical
    parameters. You can download data for historical weather patterns, paleoclimatology,
    solar events, and more in various formats.

- en: If you follow the datasets link above, a great starting point is the Global
    Hourly Data under Legacy Applications. You’ll be able to retrieve hourly data
    for most major airport-based weather stations globally, and every official station
    in the US (mostly but not always airport-based). If you’re trying to augment data
    for a specific location, start with the nearest airport.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another interesting dataset is the storm events database, which provides not
    only information about the likes of tornadoes and hail, but recorded outlier events
    such as snow in Florida, and weather-related events like avalanches that resulted
    fatalities.

    and particularly useful for seasonality-based projects. In the same section you
    can also see Weather Radar, which is reflectivity data from NWS radar installations.
    The radar data is your best option if you’re looking for something like hyper-local
    rainfall, and for better or for worse, will pose you a significant technical challenge
    in terms of making it usable for analysis in code.

    European states. It provides medium to long-range weather forecasts and allows
    free access to its datasets through the ECMWF Web API. Their ERA5 dataset is especially
    valuable for climate research, providing detailed information about the atmosphere,
    land surface, and ocean waves from 1979 to present.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the NOAA observation data, ERA5 is what’s known as “reanalysis data”.
    In contrast to observations, reanalysis is essentially a model interpolated view
    of the weather across the modeled region. For ERA5, the data is global with a
    0.25 degree resolution. Every data point location has multiple vertical levels
    available, so you can create vertical profiles of the atmosphere at any given
    time since 1979.

- en: Helpfully for us data folk, these data are available through an excellent API
    that accesses the ECMWF Copernicus data store (CDS). To use the service, you need
    to register and get yourself API keys. A pro tip for using the API is to download
    data in NetCDF format and use the xarray Python module to read it into a pandas
    dataframe.

- en: The ECMWF is high up this list because it’s such a high quality and well-regarded
    source of data. However, you must be careful in understanding the terms of use
    for the data they provide as they don’t operate under the public domain like US
    government sources. Of the publicly accessible content, some items are subject
    to their own terms of use. Such items either carry an indication of who controls
    the rights in the item and, in some cases, a link to a click use licence, or restrictions
    concerning their use are listed in image credits. The [open data page](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data)
    is a good starting point, with summaries of available data, delivery means, and
    clear links to licence requirements.

    TV or pop up on your phone, it was a human weather forecaster at the NWS who issued
    it. If you need access to current data, e.g., you have a model or dashboard operating
    in real-time, this is where you’ll want to start.

    forecasts, and wave heights, for the entire United States and territorial waters.
    More limited reporting of just current conditions is available globally. Documentation
    and access details can be found on the NWS’s official website, linked above.

    data free of charge. The available data isn’t of the same granularity and depth
    as available through NOAA or the ECMWF, but provides the best source of local
    weather and climate information for Japan.
  prefs: []

    in operation today, and provides extremely high-quality imagery of Japan, South
    East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.

    forecasts, and warnings in a range of formats, including text, XML, and graphical
    formats, are available at the link above or in relatively easy to find areas of
    the website. If you start digging deeper, you’ll probably need to use translation
    as much of the information is in Japanese.
