    a lot. It is extremely helpful to brainstorm, correct or improve texts, do translations,
    write code and find errors in it, etc. Thanks to its web nature, ChatGPT is always
    just a URL away, free, with no installs or downloads needed. That feature of OpenAI’s
    model, key for mass adoption, is only paralleled by Google’s Bard; however, since
    it rolled out later, it is arguably less popular, at least around my collaborators
    and friends. Why not give it a chance?

    for our (upcoming, stay tuned!) website for chemistry education using WebXR-based
    virtual reality, and to my horror I found that it was not operational. Well, I
    said to myself, this is a chance to try out Bard, which is also just a URL away.

    the tools in my everyday work.
