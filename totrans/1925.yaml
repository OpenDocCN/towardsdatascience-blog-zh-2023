    that can be divided into individual Parts and how each Part relates (**absolutely
    or relatively)** to that Whole. The analysis can be **Static** (shows composition
    at a moment in time) or **Dynamic** (shows changes in composition over time).

- en: Pie Charts (**PCs**) (Figure 1) are circular diagrams divided into wedged-like
    sectors used to display **Parts of a Whole** of mutually exclusive and not overlapping
    categories. The full circle represents the **Whole** while the wedges (slices,
    sectors, segments) represent the **Parts**. So, the full circle must represent
    the sum of all data and must consistently add up to 100%. Numerical data included
    in one slice must not be included in another slice because, as previously indicated,
    sectors must be mutually exclusive and overlapping is forbidden. Conceptually,
    they indicate a simple share of the Whole.

    because, inevitably, the audience’s attention will be focused on that sector.
    In addition, there is a visual distortion that makes it difficult to make direct
    comparisons with other sectors.

    vertically (horizontally). They have two axes: one axis shows categories, and
    the other axis shows numerical values with its corresponding scale. Each bar represents
    a principal category and it is divided into rectangular sectors representing subcategories
    of a second categorical variable. The numerical value of each subcategory is shown
    by the height (length) of those rectangular segments that are stacked end to end
    vertically (horizontally). The final height (length) of each principal bar indicates
    the total amount of each category (except in 100 percent stacked bar charts).'

    heights (lengths) whilst all the principal bars have the same height in 100 Percent
    SBs. You must use 100 Percent SBs when only **relative differences** matter while
    using Simple SBs when **relative and absolute differences** matter.

- en: Caution should be exercised with the number of stacked sectors or when charting
    over long periods of time. It is advisable not to stack more than four or five
    sectors on each principal bar. The audience may also get confused when there are
    too many principal bars or more than three sectors for very long periods of time.
    Given this situation, our recommendation is to employ **stacked area charts**
    when you need to display a lot of temporal data and/or four or more sectors per
    principal bar.

    you to represent a hierarchically-ordered (tree-structured) set of data. The conceptual
    idea is to compare quantities and show patterns of some hierarchical structure
    in a physically restricted space. For that purpose, rectangles of different sizes
    and colors are used to display the dataset from different perspectives. The goal
    is not to indicate the exact numerical values but to ‘break’ the dataset into
    its constituent parts and quickly identify its larger and smaller components”

    a Part of a Whole relationship. As the area of every rectangle is directly proportional
    to the numerical value it represents, they began to be used to indicate relative
    proportions and differences between parts. The full rectangle area must represent
    the sum of all data. Treemaps only show composition at a moment in time (**Static
    Composition**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Treemaps have **two principal advantages** against pie charts: 1) they can
    include ten or thousands of Parts in a scheme of nested rectangles in a relatively
    small space; 2) they code numerical values with areas, a better visual attribute
    than arc lengths along the perimeter of the circle.'

    absence of a common baseline seriously difficult the comparison between the rectangles
    that conform the parts.
