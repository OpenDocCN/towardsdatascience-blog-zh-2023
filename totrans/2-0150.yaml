- en: For me, I was motivated by a mix of career- and learning-related reasons. Before
    deciding to enrol, I spoke to many senior Data Scientists who had all told me
    that getting a master’s degree was objectively not necessary for pursuing a career
    in Data Science. I also already had a good undergraduate degree (so I didn’t need
    to show employers that I was academically capable), and I saw that there were
    enough online Data Science short courses to enable me to self-teach all the content
    I’d learn in a master’s. Nevertheless, as someone coming from a completely non-AI
    background (my previous jobs had been in Sales and Marketing), I knew that I would
    benefit from an intensive period of study, and felt like coming to Oxford was
    a bit of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

  zh: 对我而言，我的动机是职业和学习相关原因的结合。在决定报名之前，我与许多高级数据科学家交谈，他们都告诉我，获得硕士学位对于从事数据科学职业并非客观上必要。我也已经有了良好的本科学位（因此我不需要向雇主证明我的学术能力），而且我看到有足够的在线数据科学短期课程可以让我自学硕士课程中的内容。然而，作为一个完全没有AI背景的人（我之前的工作是在销售和市场营销领域），我知道自己会从一个密集的学习阶段中受益，感觉来牛津大学是一个难得的机会。

- en: 'In all likelihood, the answer isn’t as straightforward as you might like: it
    depends. If you’ve already got a degree in a STEM-related field, for instance,
    getting that master’s might not do much to boost your job chances. This is *especially*
    true if you’ve already got another higher-level qualification like a master’s
    or a PhD. That qualification already demonstrates your aptitude with numbers,
    and another degree might not add much to your profile in the eyes of prospective
    employers. Rather, the limiting factor in your career development might simply
    be your lack of commercial experience in data/analytics. In that case, you’re
    better off trying to do things that plug the “experience” gaps in your CV, for
    example getting internships or lower-level jobs.'
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 很可能，答案不像你想象的那么简单：这要看情况。例如，如果你已经有了一个与STEM相关的学位，那么获得硕士学位可能对提升你的就业机会帮助不大。这在你已经拥有如硕士或博士这样的高层次资格时尤为*明显*。这些资格已经展示了你对数字的能力，而另一个学位可能不会在潜在雇主眼中增加太多的价值。相反，你职业发展的限制因素可能仅仅是你在数据/分析方面缺乏商业经验。在这种情况下，你不如尝试弥补简历中的“经验”空白，例如获得实习或较低级别的工作。
- en: 'My point is that you shouldn’t assume that getting a master’s will significantly
    help you in your journey. The simple way to find out how necessary it is is to
    speak to people in the company/industry you’re specifically interested in. Try
    it: reach out to some senior/principal Data Scientists at companies you’d like
    to work at, and ask whether they’d consider a master’s degree a prerequisite for
    working there.'

    use of your time. At first, this might seem like a strange question. Surely, we
    think, full-time study is the best way to learn lots quickly? The thing is, however,
    while a master’s seems like an obvious way to achieve that goal, it’s not the
    only way, and might not even be the most efficient. During my master’s, for instance,
    it was compulsory to take papers in many subjects which were not directly relevant
    to Data Science (e.g., papers on survey design, the social science of the internet,
    etc.). Don’t get me wrong: these papers were very interesting and provided great
    fodder for [my portfolio](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-portfolio-that-got-me-a-data-scientist-job-513cc821bfe4),
    and I loved the broad academic experience which is hard to get outside of a university.
    But if you have very specific aims (e.g., become an expert in NLP), then doing
    a generalist/broad qualification like a master’s might not be a very efficient
    way of investing your time.'
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 接下来的问题是，你是否将这个学位视为时间的有效利用。一开始，这可能看起来是个奇怪的问题。我们认为，全日制学习是快速学习大量知识的最佳方式？然而，问题是，尽管硕士学位似乎是实现这一目标的明显途径，但它并不是唯一的方式，甚至可能不是最有效的。在我的硕士期间，例如，必须修读许多与数据科学不直接相关的课程（例如，调查设计、互联网社会学等）。不要误解我的意思：这些课程非常有趣，为[我的作品集](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-portfolio-that-got-me-a-data-scientist-job-513cc821bfe4)提供了很好的素材，我喜欢这种在大学之外难以获得的广泛学术体验。但如果你有非常具体的目标（例如，成为NLP领域的专家），那么像硕士这样的广泛资格可能不是一个很有效的时间投资方式。

    the pros and cons of different opportunities. Ironically, for me an example of
    this came when I was *finishing* my master’s, when one of our professors was encouraging
    us to think about extending our studies into PhDs. His argument went something
    like this: employers rate PhDs much more highly than master’s degrees, so if we
    wanted to get top jobs, we should strongly consider extending our studies for
    a few more years and working towards PhDs.'

  zh: 考虑机会成本是评估不同机会利弊的一个非常有用的经验法则。具有讽刺意味的是，我在*完成*硕士学位时遇到了这个例子，当时我们的一个教授鼓励我们考虑将学习延续到博士学位。他的论点大致是这样的：雇主对博士学位的评价远高于硕士学位，所以如果我们想获得顶级职位，我们应该强烈考虑将学习延续几年，争取博士学位。
- en: The thing is, however, this isn’t really a fair comparison, because if a PhD
    takes 4 years to complete, then really we should be comparing a PhD to a masters
    + 3 years of work experience in Data Science. And all of a sudden it seems much
    less obvious that a PhD is a good idea, given that 3 years of work experience
    adds an awful lot to a candidate’s profile in the world of AI.

  zh: 然而，这实际上并不公平，因为如果博士学位需要4年时间完成，那么我们实际上应该把博士学位与硕士学位加3年数据科学工作经验进行比较。突然之间，博士学位是否是一个好主意变得不那么明显，因为3年的工作经验在人工智能领域中对候选人简历的提升是巨大的。
- en: 'Don’t get me wrong; a PhD might still be a prerequisite for certain jobs. The
    point I’m making is that you need to look at all the options and compare them
    fairly. A simple way to do this is to think of your time as a resource that you
    can invest. Simply ask yourself: how can I invest this resource to drive maximum

    not a guaranteed that you’ll find a well-paying job, so don’t assume that any

    my fees. I also worked for a couple of years before doing my master’s degree,
    so that I had time to save up for it. Because of the large financial outlay, I

- en: Other things to consider are whether the course is a taught or research masters,
    whether it offers the chance to do work placements, whether it’s online/remote,

    suitable it is for you. In my case, I had a bit of coding experience, but really
    wanted something that would be comprehensive and cover all the bases of a general
    Data Science education. Given that I had a social sciences and business background,
    I was also keen to pick a course that focused on the application of AI to problems
    in economics and business, rather than a purely theoretical course which downplayed

  zh: 我认为很多人攻读硕士学位是为了推迟关于未来的决定。不要这样做！不如选择一个间隔年，获得一些实际工作经验，以了解你是否喜欢日常工作。
- en: Ultimately, Data Science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider
    that data science might not be the right path for you. You might be more suited
    to an adjacent field like product management, software engineering, design, human-computer
    interaction, research, statistics, data visualisation, analytics translation,
    or something like that. There are tons of related careers out there, and you shouldn’t
    write off the less-well-known or less-hyped options just because you don’t know
    much about them. I tried a few different jobs before settling on my master’s,
    and I think they really helped me know for definite that AI was the area I wanted
    to go into. Plus, once you come out the other end of the master’s, having some
    prior commercial experience will help propel you into that next job.

  zh: 最终，数据科学并不适合每个人，考虑到数据科学可能不是你合适的路径，这一点很重要。你可能更适合其他相关领域，比如产品管理、软件工程、设计、人机交互、研究、统计学、数据可视化、分析翻译等。相关的职业有很多，你不应该因为对它们了解不多而排除那些不那么知名或不那么热门的选项。在决定攻读硕士学位之前，我尝试了几份不同的工作，我认为这些经历确实帮助我明确了自己想进入人工智能领域。此外，一旦你完成了硕士学位，拥有一些商业经验将有助于你顺利进入下一份工作。
