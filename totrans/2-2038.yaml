    polynomial has an R²=1 on both the train and the test sets. And this should tell
    us something…

    the data (but we could tell so even because we get R²=1 for both the train and
    the test sets. But, again: we found something obvious here. But it’s good to discover
    obvious things because we know we''re doing well!).'

    and quadratic model, the KDEs clearly tell us that these are not good models to
    solve this ML problem. So, we should investigate other models.

- en: Finally, to give a piece of final advice, if we really want to calculate `p-values`
    so that we’re sure our model respects the hypotheses, we can calculate them in
    the end (so we’ll calculate them only for the model we believe is the best one).

- en: The usage of `p-values` is somehow a controversial topic. It is useful to test
    our hypotheses, but it doesn’t give us any guarantees about the results, as per
    what the ASA says.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My personal idea is that `p-values` are more suitable in scientific research,
    where it’s important to show we’ve used a rigorous method when arriving at some
    results (remembering that, as per what ASA said, the results mustn’t be based
    only on `p-values`).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considering we need to test different ML models on a given dataset for the no-free
    lunch theorem, when providing business value with ML there’s really no need to
    use `p-values` for giving a scientific base to our results. Anyway, if we want
    to use them, we can test the hypotheses at the very end, to show that the model
    we’ve chosen respects the hypotheses.
