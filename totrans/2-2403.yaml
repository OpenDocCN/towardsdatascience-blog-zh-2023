    music. My [first article](/writing-songs-with-gpt-4-part-1-lyrics-3728da678482)
    covered writing lyrics for songs, and my [second article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/writing-songs-with-gpt-4-part-2-chords-173cfda0e5a1)
    delved into composing chords to go along with lyrics. In this article, after a
    brief introduction to GPT-4, I’ll show you how to coax the model to create melodies
    for songs with chords and lyrics. I’ll wrap up with a general discussion and offer
    some next steps for composing music with AI.

    paid version of their ChatGPT service, which costs US$20 per month. The model
    is an improvement on their previous iteration, GPT-3.5\. Here’s an excerpt of
    what OpenAI says about the new model on their [GPT4 landing site](https://openai.com/gpt-4).

    edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as
    composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style. … We
    spent 6 months making GPT-4 safer and more aligned. GPT-4 is 82% less likely to
    respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual
    responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations - OpenAI

    OpenAI is working on extending GPT-4 to use images in prompts. This model is not
    available to the public yet, but it is available in a beta version of an app called
    [Be My Eyes](https://openai.com/customer-stories/be-my-eyes). The app helps people
    who are blind or have low vision with daily tasks by analyzing pictures and reading
    a text description of the scene.

    as plain text. Instead of the usual musical notes on a staff, guitar tabs show
    which frets are used over time for the strings on an instrument. For example,
    here’s the first line of “Happy Birthday to You” as a six-stringed guitar tab.

    to play at points in time. A bigger number corresponds to a higher note. After
    experimenting with this, I found that there were enough guitar tabs with the corresponding
    commentary found in the web-based training data to allow language models to compose
    in this format.
