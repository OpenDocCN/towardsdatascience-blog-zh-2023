    GPT-4\. At their recent I/O event, Google unveiled the captivating PaLM 2 model
    family, ranging from the smallest to the largest: **Gecko, Otter, Bison, and Unicorn.**
    Not only PaLM2 is better, faster, and smaller than the previous PaLM, but it also
    outshines gpt-4 in certain areas of reasoning, according to Google [PaLM 2 Technical
    Report](https://www.notion.so/133e1a64b8ed4329851394435eb41adb?pvs=21) **(** (see

    learning journey to adopt LLMs to better serve our outdoor community. Recently,
    we had the opportunity to put PaLM2 and GPT-3.5 to the test using real-life use
    cases from Outside. If you are contemplating the choice between Google and OpenAI
    as your LLM provider, or you simply want to learn how to build a Langchain agent
    equipped with search and questions-answering from knowledge base tools, I hope
    this post may offer some inspiration for devising an evaluation framework suited
    to your domain.

    it turns out that it was related to the authentication process. Their authentication
    operates in a cascading style, flowing from organization to project to services.
    My scenario is “a user impersonates the identity of a service account”. And the
    solution is that I need be to granted “Service Account User Role” in order to

    providing quicker responses during interactions. However, when it comes to following
    human instructions (more “steerable”), gpt-3.5-turbo clearly wins. The quality
    of answers from gpt-3.5-turbo, at least from the questions we tested, tends to
    be superior. Additionally, both models exhibit the ability to navigate around

    Palm could be a favorable choice. On the other hand, if the ability to follow
    nuanced instructions and deliver high-quality answers while maintaining a friendly
    tone is paramount, OpenAI’s gpt-3.5 seems the preferred option (gpt-4 is even
    better if cost is not your concern!)

  zh: 在选择这些模型时。如果速度是**至关重要**的，那么 Google Palm 可能是一个不错的选择。另一方面，如果遵循细微指令并在保持友好语气的同时提供高质量回答是**关键**的，那么
    OpenAI 的 gpt-3.5 似乎是更好的选择（如果成本不是问题，gpt-4 更佳！）
