    GPT-4\. At their recent I/O event, Google unveiled the captivating PaLM 2 model
    family, ranging from the smallest to the largest: **Gecko, Otter, Bison, and Unicorn.**
    Not only PaLM2 is better, faster, and smaller than the previous PaLM, but it also
    outshines gpt-4 in certain areas of reasoning, according to Google [PaLM 2 Technical
    Report](https://www.notion.so/133e1a64b8ed4329851394435eb41adb?pvs=21) **(** (see

    learning journey to adopt LLMs to better serve our outdoor community. Recently,
    we had the opportunity to put PaLM2 and GPT-3.5 to the test using real-life use
    cases from Outside. If you are contemplating the choice between Google and OpenAI
    as your LLM provider, or you simply want to learn how to build a Langchain agent
    equipped with search and questions-answering from knowledge base tools, I hope
    this post may offer some inspiration for devising an evaluation framework suited
    to your domain.

    be superior. Additionally, both models exhibit the ability to navigate around
    political and personal questions, ensuring a reasonable responsible conversational
    environment. Another thing I‚Äôm really impressed by gpt-3.5 is that it often provides
    more thoughtful and friendly advice.

    Models, I find myself oscillating between a sense of amazement at their abilities
    and reasonably growing concern in terms of being part of the force pushing humanity
    towards an uncertain future. Actually, I made [a whole video](https://youtu.be/eQ6z6S8EHVs)
    about it if you don‚Äôt mind the potential cringes from a newbie YouTuber.

    One thing that came to me is that while it‚Äôs informative to refer to the evaluation
    methods outlined in LLMs‚Äô technical reports, it‚Äôs perhaps more crucial to derive
    the specific evaluation requirements and priorities for your users and your organization‚Äôs
    particular use cases.

    Palm could be a favorable choice. On the other hand, if the ability to follow
    nuanced instructions and deliver high-quality answers while maintaining a friendly
    tone is paramount, OpenAI‚Äôs gpt-3.5 seems the preferred option (gpt-4 is even
    better if cost is not your concern!)
