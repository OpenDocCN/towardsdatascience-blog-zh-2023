    have also noted Data Governance as a must-have for organisations dealing with
    High-Risk AI Systems to stay compliant. Despite the increasing scale of data,
    organisations have regressed instead of enhancing governance efforts, leading
    to weaker Data Governance practices.

    Governance for your organisation.
  prefs: []

- en: 1\. Replace Data Stewards with a Co-Pilot
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my many years of implementing Data Governance for clients, I am yet to meet
    a happy Data Steward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They have the impossible task of translating the data into business and vice-versa,
    with little authority to enforce compliance. The reasons for failure usually include
    poorly designed Governance models, lack of senior management buy-in or seeing
    Governance as a one-off project with minimal investment.

- en: '[A Co-Pilot using LLM](https://atlan.com/ai/) can create policy documents,
    capture business and technical metadata, verify data creation is according to
    agreed standards etc. Even if you can''t invest in a new tool, a Co-Pilot can
    be a Slack/Teams Bot, linked to your organisation''s metadata tool, simply answering
    "FAQs" such as who owns the data, which data is the master, what''s the definition
    of a particular column etc. for the end user.'

    Data Engineers can ensure enough metadata is documented and fed to the Co-Pilot
    to stop the queries from end users coming their way. Data Analysts/Scientists
    can rely on the Co-Pilot to answer enough questions to help with their analytical
    queries.

  prefs:

    the sake of saying "thanks, bye!" at the end of the call.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A weekly data working group & metadata forum, a two-weekly data quality forum
    and a monthly data committee meeting. Although started with good intentions, most
    of these forums tend to have similar audiences, repeating the same or similar
    messages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A decision matrix and intelligent workflow automation should be able to handle
    over 90% of incoming Data Governance requests. For example, if a request is for
    personal location data access, the end business use case is demographic analytics.
    The governance tool can use a matrix like the one below to spit out the answer.

    Data Analysts/Scientists can rely on the intelligent decision output from the
    governance tool (that could be a Slack/Teams Bot, too) to understand whether the
    data is accessible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Classifying and then tagging data adds much-needed context to Data Governance
    decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, classifying data has been one of the most challenging jobs. It
    was either resource intensive, as someone had to manually look through data assets
    and determine their classification or technology-intensive, where data would have
    to be constantly scanned for changes and updates.

- en: '[Semantic Embedding](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/3-simple-and-powerful-ways-this-ai-technique-will-transform-data-management-fe2b66fb9a03)
    is revolutionising context. For each data asset, a contextual embedding can be
    created in the form of Vectors. Using similarity scores, these vectors can be
    ranked for their classification. For example, data related to a customer, their
    address, date of birth etc., can be grouped as "personal data" using a vector
    similarity search. This will also work for unstructured [data like documents](https://hanzalaqureshi.medium.com/the-5-simple-steps-to-create-a-powerful-ai-driven-document-search-tool-ecd502fa6637).'

- en: Data Governance teams can spend less time manually classifying and tagging data.
    Intelligent workflows can be built around these classifications of data to provide
    decision support, such as "can the data be accessed?", "is the data personal or
    sensitive?". This information can be surfaced to the Data Analyst/Scientist using
    Co-Pilots as discussed in 1 and used in decision making as discussed in 2.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are disparate in data, one tool for Engineering, another for Management,
    another for Governance and yet another for Privacy. Organisations often need to
    improve at integrating Data Governance across their estate, especially if it is
    agile and constantly changing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Marketplace is your area for cataloguing and then discovering data, as it
    will be linked to all your disparate data assets. And the culmination of all the
    above techniques can be brought centrally into a Data Product Marketplace. For
    example, a table with customer information will be catalogued in the Marketplace,
    classified and tagged using Semantic Embedding (3), accessed using an intelligent
    governance workflow (2), and contextualised by a Co-Pilot (1).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does this impact a data team?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Scientists can easily find the data in the Marketplace and whether the
    data can be used using the Co-Pilot. Data Engineers can reuse the Marketplace
    data instead of creating more duplication. Data Analysts can use the profile of
    the data in the Marketplace to determine whether it's good enough for their use
    case. Data Leaders can rely on a single platform for their governance and reporting
    needs.

    will be forever important; getting the foundations right. If your data is poor,
    you don't need a Co-Pilot to regurgitate that message.
