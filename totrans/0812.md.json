According to available information:\nIn one source, it is mentioned that the trip computer indicated fuel \nconsumption of 9.2L/100km in 2500km worth of driving, which is \nconsiderably higher than Mazda's claimed 8.4L/100km for the CX-9\\. \nThis figure was achieved with one or two people in the car, not a \nfull family and their belongings. However, further testing and simulations \nwere mentioned to corroborate fuel consumption.\n\nIn another source comparing the Mazda CX-8 and CX-9, it is stated that \nthe CX-8 averaged 7.1L/100km on a specific tour, while the CX-9 \naveraged 10.1L/100km. These figures indicate that the CX-8 is more \nfuel-efficient than the CX-9 in this particular comparison.\n\nIn a different source discussing the 2023 Mazda CX-8, the official \ncombined fuel consumption claim for the CX-8 Touring Active is 6.0L/100km, \nachieved with the assistance of the i-Stop function. However, during a \ntest drive on open roads with one passenger and little luggage, the \nTouring Active averaged 8.6L/100km.\n\nSo, the fuel efficiency of the 2019 Mazda CX-9 may vary depending \non driving conditions and the specific model/configuration. It's \nrecommended to refer to the official manufacturer's specifications \nand conduct real-world testing to determine the exact fuel efficiency \nof a specific CX-9 model.\n```", "```py\nYou are a friendly chatbot who are required to respond to questions \nusing details from excerpts taken from documents about cars of \nparticular model years.\nThese documents may have information about the model year of car in \nreview within its content or title.
