    by major advances in computer vision. According to a recent [interview](https://venturebeat.com/ai/10-years-on-ai-pioneers-hinton-lecun-li-say-deep-learning-revolution-will-continue/)
    of Geoffrey Hinton, by 2013 *“pretty much all the computer vision research had

    a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), pulled off a record-breaking performance

    the potential of deep learning for image recognition tasks. It achieved a [top-5

    and three fully-connected linear layers — an architectural design dismissed by
    many as impractical at the time. Moreover, due to the large number of parameters
    produced by the network’s depth, training was done in parallel on two graphics
    processing units (GPUs), demonstrating the ability to significantly accelerate
    training on large datasets. Training time was further reduced by swapping traditional
    activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh, for the more efficient rectified
    linear unit ([ReLU](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/reluICML.pdf)).

    — generative models that can learn to represent and generate data such as images
    and sounds. They work by learning a compressed representation of the input data
    in a lower-dimensional space, known as *latent space*. This allows them to generate
    new data by sampling from this learned latent space. VAEs, later on, turned out
    to open up new avenues for generative modeling and data generation, with applications
    in fields like art, design, and gaming.

    network evaluates their authenticity. This training is performed in a game-like
    setup, with the generator trying to create samples that fool the discriminator,

    titled “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition”, in which they introduced
    the concept of residual neural networks, or ResNets — architectures that allow
    information to flow more easily through the network by adding shortcuts. Unlike
    in a regular neural network, where each layer takes the output of the previous
    layer as input, in a ResNet, additional *residual* connections are added that
    skip one or more layers and directly connect to deeper layers in the network.

    to generate some buzz around 2015, mainly due to factors such as (1) the availability
    of larger and more diverse datasets for training, (2) improvements in computational
    power and hardware, which enabled the training of deeper and more complex models,

    The encoder is responsible for encoding the input data, which, for example, can
    be a sequence of words. It then takes the input sequence and applies multiple
    layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural nets to capture the relationships
    and features within the sentence and learn meaningful representations.'

    different words in a sentence. Unlike traditional models, which would process
    words in a fixed order, transformers actually examine all the words at once. They
    assign something called *attention* scores to each word based on its relevance
    to other words in the sentence.

    and produces an output sequence. In tasks such as machine translation or text
    generation, the decoder generates the translated sequence based on the input received
    from the encoder. Similar to the encoder, the decoder also consists of multiple
    layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural nets. However, it includes an
    additional attention mechanism that enables it to focus on the encoder’s output.
    This then allows the decoder to take into account relevant information from the
    input sequence while generating the output.

    was introduced by OpenAI in June 2018, which utilized the transformer architecture

    last decade of AI development: people are actually using Bing! Earlier this year,
    Microsoft [introduced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/)
    its GPT-4-powered “*copilot for the web*” that has been customized for search
    and, for the first time in… forever (?), has emerged as a serious contender to
    Google’s long-standing dominance in the search business.'

- en: As we reflect on the last ten years of AI development, it becomes evident that
    we have been witnessing a transformation that has had profound impact on how we
    work, do business, and interact with one another. Most of the considerable progress
    that has lately been achieved with generative models, particularly LLMs, seems
    to be adhering to the common belief that “bigger is better”, referring to the
    parameter space of the models. This has been especially noticeable with the GPT
    series, which started out with 117 million parameters (GPT-1) and, after each
    successive model increasing by approximately an order of magnitude, culminated
    in GPT-4 with potentially trillions of parameters.

    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes that we have reached the end of the “bigger is
    better” era. Going forward, he still thinks that the parameter count will trend
    up, but the main focus of future model improvements will be on increasing the
    model’s capability, utility, and safety.

    are now in the hands of the general public and no longer confined to the controlled
    environment of research labs, it is now more critical than ever that we tread
    with caution and ensure that these tools are safe and align with humanity’s best
    interests. Hopefully we’ll see as much development and investment in AI safety
    as we’ve seen in other areas.
