Basically, this park is\ngood only for small children and people who has never been to Disney.\nThe food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive.\nBottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water\nfountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was\npretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was\nthe people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines\nfor the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget\ntrying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see\nhow Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney\nproperty.\n\"\"\"\n```", "```py\n# Write the prompt and generate the response using the helper function\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\n    Summarize the review below in 30 words.\n    Review: ```", "```py\n    \"\"\"\n\nresponse = get_completion(prompt)\nprint(response)\n```", "```py\nprompt = f\"\"\"\n    Summarize the review below in 10 words and\n    focus price and value.\n    Review: ```", "```py\n\n> Expensive, small, and crowded Disneyland with few attractions.\n\nBy generating a targeted summary, we have transformed our initial review into a more meaningful and impactful statement. 🍄\n\nNow, let’s take it a step further and extract relevant information in the JSON format for easier processing and integration with other systems.
