  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most of my professional life working in data, I’ve taken a pretty standard
    approach to professional branding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I created a personal portfolio, maintained a LinkedIn profile, and occasionally
    posted about a significant career achievement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with this approach is that portfolios and LinkedIn profiles are
    tucked away in an obscure corner of the internet. No one can find your stuff unless
    they actively go looking for it, and you haven’t really got a mechanism to get
    feedback on your work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you write online, by contrast, you’re able to share your work with a wider
    audience and get very good feedback on things like Reading Time and Read Ratios.
    If you persevere, writing is a fantastic way to build a personal brand and become
    the “go-to” person in a specific niche.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of my aims, for instance, is to try and become the go-to person writing
    about Data Science Careers. It would be really hard to build that kind of niche
    brand if I were relying entirely on a personal portfolio or the occasional humble-brag-slash-inspirational
    LinkedIn post, but by writing on Medium, it’s easy to carve out that kind of online
    identity.

    for example. Cassie’s the Chief Decision Scientist at Google, and an incredibly
    inspiring person to follow in the world of Data. By writing online, she has carved
    out a fantastic personal brand which has meant that even clueless people like
    me know who she is. Or take [Chris Albon](https://twitter.com/chrisalbon?lang=en),
    the Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, who has probably
    the funniest Twitter account in the world of Data. Chris has built a fantastic
    personal brand through years of building up a great library, and he gets to use
    that platform to share great learning resources with people from all around the
    world.

    and can be a much more enjoyable alternative to something like LinkedIn.

    content.

    super active and engaged audience, you’re unlikely to have many interested followers.
    Your followers tend to be people who already know you, and — what’s worse — half
    of them are probably only uninterested semi-contacts. Heck, my LinkedIn network
    includes people I worked with in my first Saturday job at the local newsagents.
    It’s lovely to be in touch, but there’s not much value for either of us in me
    sharing my thoughts on the AI revolution.

    Data Science and Towards AI. I’m able to target people who are in my field specifically,

    Networks. When I share these musings on a platform like Medium, I’m able to get

    Sure — when you’re starting out, you might spend most of your time coding and
    not do much presenting outside of internal team meetings. But if you want to advance
    your career, it’s absolutely critical that you develop strong storytelling and
    communication skills. Remember: Senior and Principal Data Scientists spend a lot
    more time presenting than they do coding. Writing helps you do this because you’re
    constantly thinking about how to land your points well and where to cut down on
    the unnecessary fluff.'

- en: I remember when I created the first version of my portfolio site, back when
    I was finishing my master’s degree in Data Science a little under a year ago.
    It was time to start applying for Data Science jobs, and I wanted a way to showcase
    some of the projects I’d been working on. I’d heard people talking about the importance
    of building an online portfolio, and so I whipped up a [simple static site](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-portfolio-that-got-me-a-data-scientist-job-513cc821bfe4)
    using GitHub pages and Jekyll.

- en: While this portfolio was immensely [helpful for getting my first jobs](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/11-practical-things-that-helped-me-land-my-first-data-science-job-be5d2036d49),
    as soon as I started working full-time as a Data Scientist, I found that I didn’t
    have time (or inclination) to do Data Science projects outside of work hours.
    Employers were also much more interested in my achievements at work than they
    were in my personal projects, and before long I’d given up on my portfolio.

    way to build career capital in the long-term.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Firstly, because it’s fast. Doing a full Data Science project takes a long
    time, but writing a quick blog post (like this one) can be done in an hour or
    two.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, because **you can write about anything you want**. This makes writing
    a very sustainable long-term strategy for building career capital, because you
    can change what you write about over time. When you’re “on the ground” working
    as a coder, you can share coding tips or project summaries. When you’re a bit
    higher up and spend most of your time meeting with stakeholders or figuring out
    team strategies, you can write about the big picture stuff. Regardless of which
    stage of your career you’re at, it’s super easy to share your online writing with
    technical and non-technical recruiters alike, and you get to demonstrate your
    communication skills “in real life” by showing how you write.

    has taught us anything, it’s that algorithms and coding languages may change,

    will mean I’ll be doing a lot less coding (or, at least, my coding will be much
    faster). But I’ll sure as heck still be telling stories with data, so it feels
    like a good investment to work on this skill.'

    and my second was a guide on how to [bin data with SQL](https://medium.com/p/70627ccb2978).
    Both were only super simple topics, but this was actually an advantage because
    they didn’t take long to write about, making it very easy to “get the ball rolling.”'

    pages. Regardless of what you’re writing about, try and show your readers a personal
    angle: if you’re sharing a coding tip or theoretical explainer, how has this {technique/concept}
    helped you in your personal job/project? How long did it take you to learn? Any
    advice on how to put your tips into practice?'
