    familiar and yet frequently misconstrued - the elusive, yet ever present, p-value.
    Don’t worry if you’ve found yourself scratching your head over it before; I’m
    here to break it down in hopefully an engaging and clear way.

    first job, you’ve done your due diligence, invested countless hours conquering
    coding challenges like leet code, and mastered intricate concepts of machine learning
    algorithms, you''re prepared and confident for your very first job interview.
    The interviewer is welcoming, the atmosphere is inviting, and the questions appear
    within your knowledge base, and then they ask you: "What exactly is a p-value?"'

    have been something like, "It indicates the significance of our hypothesis." However,
    as the interviewer digs further, you realize you might be diving into deeper waters
    than anticipated. If this scenario sounds familiar, rest assured – you're not
    alone. In this blog post, we'd attempt to genuinely try to deconstruct what a
    p-value is and what it isn’t. We'll do so, step by step, so that the next time
    you encounter this concept, you'll possess proper understanding of the concept.

    me, its significance is far from straightforward. This concept can prove to be
    a bit unintuitive and difficult to grasp, primarily due to common misconceptions
    and even misuse in the industry.

    “Drug Alpha” as a remedy for headaches. The question at hand: does Drug Alpha
    genuinely alleviates headaches? To scrutinize its efficacy, MM Pharmaceuticals
    conduct a study involving two groups — one receives Drug Alpha, while the other
    is administered a [placebo](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scientists at MM Pharmaceuticals are naturally skeptical, positing that
    Drug Alpha’s impact on headache relief mirrors that of the placebo aka Drug Alpha
    has no substantial impact. So, upon analyzing the outcomes of the conducted study,
    they anticipate results that support this assumption. However, to their astonishment,
    the results deviate significantly from what one would expect if Drug Alpha acted
    similarly to the placebo. This anomaly captures their attention, prompting further
    investigation. This scenario exemplifies an instance of a very low p-value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let’s introduce some key terminology. The [**null hypothesis**](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/null-hypothesis/)
    serves as our initial assumption also known as the status quo assumption - stating
    that Drug Alpha lacks the ability to alleviate headaches and mirrors the placebo’s
    effects. This hypothesis is akin to the skepticism embraced by the scientists
    at MM Pharmaceuticals. It represents our baseline notion, suggesting no discernible
    effect of Drug Alpha whatsoever. This is the assumption we’ve modeled our world
    around where we conduct the study. Conversely, the **alternative hypothesis**
    posits that Drug Alpha indeed provides headache relief - an outcome we consider
    unlikely. This alternate hypothesis is what we’re rigorously testing for.

    with the null hypothesis assumption. A high p-value indicates congruence between
    results and the null hypothesis, implying that our outcomes are not surprising,
    and the initial assumption holds merit.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a low p-value introduces an element of surprise as observed by scientists
    at MM Pharmaceuticals. The test outcomes deviate from the expected test outcome
    under the null hypothesis. This prompts us to reevaluate our starting assumptions,
    contemplating the possibility that our initial assumption might be incorrect.
    In this **improbable** scenario, the p-value presents the chance that Drug Alpha
    could genuinely relieve headaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In essence, the p-value equips us with a tool to assess whether our observed
    results are congruent with our initial assumption. A high p-value aligns with
    the null hypothesis, whereas a low p-value hints at the need to reconsider our
    assumptions and do further investigation. Therefore , p-value is a gauge that
    assists us in determining if the evidence is compelling enough to question preconceived
    notions. However, it’s vital to note that the p-value itself is not evidence,
    proof, or an objective measure; rather, it’s a guideline.

    as extreme as what we’ve gathered, under the assumption that the null hypothesis
    is valid. A notably low p-value (typically less than 0.05) implies that our observed
    data is improbable under the null hypothesis. This leads us to question the null
    hypothesis and entertain the possibility of a substantial effect.

    effectiveness that we’ve observed, assuming the drug and placebo yield identical
    results. When the p-value falls below a predefined significance threshold (often
    0.05, referred to as alpha), we tend to question the truth of the null hypothesis
    and infer there’s significance to the alternate hypothesis i.e. the drug does
    relieve headaches.

    a very small p-value. It indicates that the drug does have an effect. While this
    simplified analysis only compares means of two groups with straightforward data,
    even in this scenario, the alternate hypothesis, pointing towards the effectiveness
    of the drug, warrants further investigation.

    The p-value is indeed a powerful tool for hypothesis testing. It allows us to
    assess the extent to which our observed data aligns with our initial assumptions,
    and helps us in making informed decisions about hypotheses. However, the p-value
    is not a verdict or a definitive measure of truth. Instead, it serves as a gauge
    that points researchers toward further investigation into a given hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to note is that while a low p-value may suggest that our observed
    results differ significantly from what we’d expect under the null hypothesis,
    it doesn’t provide a magnitude of effect. In other words, it doesn’t inform us
    about the practical or quantifiable significance or even the real-world impact
    of our findings. Additionally, a high p-value, is not a proof in favor of the
    null hypothesis, and doesn’t **definitively** negate alternate hypotheses. Therefore,
    you need to be cautious when using p-value to draw conclusions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, usually there’s reliance on a predefined alpha / significance level,
    often set at 0.05, brings more ambiguity i.e. is 0.051 significantly different
    than 0.049? Is the alpha determined really appropriate for the hypothesis under
    consideration?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then there’s the concept of Type I and Type II errors. A low p-value doesn’t
    eliminate the possibility of a Type I error, where we incorrectly reject a true
    null hypothesis. Similarly, a high p-value doesn’t guarantee avoidance of a Type
    II error, where we fail to reject a false null hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In conclusion, being more nuanced in our understanding of the p-value is a step
    toward better statistical thinking and better results as an outcome. Recognizing
    its role as a guide rather than a definitive answer can help us to navigate the
    complexities landscape of data analysis and hypothesis testing. Simultaneously,
    acknowledging its limitations helps us to approach results with caution.

    serves as a guidepost for researchers. It points them towards further exploration,
    signaling when their data deviates from their initial assumptions. So, the next
    time you come across p-value, I hope you know exactly what purpose it serves.
