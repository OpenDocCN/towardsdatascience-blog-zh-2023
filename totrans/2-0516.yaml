    we expanded our understanding of social network analysis by graphing the relationships
    between the members of the bands [Smashing Pumpkins](https://smashingpumpkins.com/)
    and [Zwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwan). Then, we examined metrics like
    degree centrality and betweenness centrality to investigate the relationships
    between the members of the different bands. At the same time, we discussed how
    domain knowledge helps to inform our understanding of the results.

    within a network. The idea is that nodes with higher closeness centrality are
    able to reach other nodes more quickly and efficiently, as they have shorter average
    distances to the rest of the network.

    within themselves compared to connections with nodes outside the group. Communities
    capture the idea of cohesive subgroups or modules within a network, where nodes
    within the same community have stronger connections to each other. Communities
    are characterized by the presence of dense intra-community connections and relatively
    sparser inter-community connections.

    easy to imagine how the bands are connected to each other by the members that
    they share. This demonstrates both intra-group connectivity among the members
    within each band, and inter-group connectivity between both bands.

    values within the community. This indicates that nodes within a community are
    closely connected and can reach each other quickly in terms of shortest path distances.
    Higher closeness centrality within communities reflects the efficient information
    flow and communication within the subgroups.

- en: Closeness centrality can also be used at the community level to analyze the
    importance of communities within the network. By aggregating closeness centrality
    values of nodes within a community, one can assess the overall efficiency of information
    flow within the community. Communities with higher average closeness centrality
    may be considered more central and influential in terms of their ability to access
    and disseminate information within the network.

    provide insight into how members of Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan directly and indirectly
    influence the other musicians in Billy Corgan’s network. We can use the concept
    of community to describe each band, but we can also use it to describe the aggregate
    of both bands. In reality, the community of alternative rock musicians from the
    1990’s is vast, and when we add more bands to the network, more communities will
    emerge.

    each other quickly.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Paz Lenchantin, David Pajo, and Matt Sweeney have a slightly lower closeness
    centrality value of 0.611111\. This indicates that they may be less central in
    terms of reaching other members compared to the previous group, but they are still
    relatively well connected within the network.

    not reveal anything beyond what we learned when we calculated degree centrality
    and betweenness centrality for Billy Corgan’s network. In Part 4, we will add
    complexity by introducing more bands and musicians to the network. As a bonus,
    we will introduced some advanced techniques in [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    to make your [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graphs even more engaging!
