- en: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive and fast-moving field whose developmental
    trajectory is accelerating rapidly. In fact, the number of publications in this
    space has been rising dramatically in recent years. Stanford’s annual Artificial
    Intelligence Index Report shows that the number of AI publications has increased
    from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021 [1].

    intervals between major industry advances such as OpenAI’s [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/),
    [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/),
    or DeepMind’s [AlphaFold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371605/).
    Those are just some examples that captured the attention of both the general public
    and the tech industry as they were extensively reported on and widely circulated
    on social media. However, advancements are also becoming more frequent in other
    disciplines, ranging from robotics to drug discovery, self-driving cars, and space
    exploration.

    makes it increasingly difficult for AI practitioners and developers to stay up-to-date
    with the latest research. This article will outline some strategies on how to
    navigate this landscape without suffering from information overload. Specifically,
    we will divide this article into sections based on the frequency with which the

    daily learning slots may seem hard to squeeze in. However, there are a few things
    that can be done on a daily basis without having to carve out significant chunks
    of time.

    and it typically only takes a few minutes to read them. Examples include [The
    Download](https://www.technologyreview.com/collection/the-download/) by MIT Technology
    Review, or [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/). These are not necessarily AI-centric, but
    rather technology-focused newsletters containing the latest developments in the
    tech sector, including plenty of AI-related content.

    that sends out daily listings of new submissions based on custom-specified topics.
    These topics can be selected from their [category taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy).
    For instance, AI is present under the category *Computer Science*, and denoted
    as *cs.AI*. Similarly, **Google Scholar** also provides an [alerting service](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en)
    based on user-specific topics of interest.

    follow their authors on social media, particularly **Twitter**. A lot of the big
    names in AI are using the platform to share their publications, thoughts, and
    information on their projects, including [Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/ylecun),
    [Geoffrey Hinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton), [Richard Sutton](https://twitter.com/RichardSSutton),

    here and there, weekly learning should be a bit more in-depth. A time investment
    of a few hours per week seems reasonable for the endeavors outlined below.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most reliable and highest-quality sources of AI research are **peer-reviewed
    research papers**. There are a variety of sources and journals from which those
    can be retrieved, such as [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/publications/index.html),
    [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/), [Pattern
    Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pattern-recognition), and many
    more. In addition, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a great source for open-access
    e-prints. The only caveat here is that, while these e-prints do go through a content
    moderation process, they are not peer-reviewed.

    where AI research is headed. By now, there is an enormous number of podcasts available
    throughout a variety of platforms, so one has to be selective. Here are a few
    suggestions of top-rated AI podcasts: [The TWIML AI Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-twiml-ai-podcast-formerly-this-week-in-machine/id1116303051)

    the planning aspect here might be a little difficult as these activities tend
    to occur on an ad-hoc basis. Examples include **symposiums**, **webinars**, **reading
    groups**, or **lectures**. While most of these events are regularly hosted by
    a range of educational institutions and businesses, only some of them are available
    to the general public.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are lucky enough to be affiliated with an institution that regularly
    hosts such events, that’s great! However, if this is not the case, being proactive
    in this domain can go a long way. Gather your colleagues and set up your own reading
    group or journal club where you keep each other in the loop and discuss the latest
    research findings in your area of interest.

    taking place both in-person and remotely. This is a great way to catch up with
    recent developments in the field, learn more about state-of-the-art methodologies,
    and engage in stimulating conversations with fellow researchers and engineers.

    (NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc/), the [International Conference on Machine Learning
    (ICML)](https://icml.cc/), the [International Conference on Learning Representations
    (ICLR)](https://iclr.cc/), [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/),
    and the [Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/).
    These conferences cover a wide range of topics such as natural language processing,
    robotics, image processing, brain-computer interfaces, and much more. Again, it
    is important to be selective here in order to not experience information overload
    by attempting to attend every session at such a conference.

    of recurrence — that can be undertaken in order to keep up with the latest research
    in AI. As the amount of information in this space increases every day, it is important
    to be selective in order to avoid information overload. Specializing in a particular
    subfield can also help narrowing down the scope of research within which one would
    like to keep up.

    and podcasts, some do require subscriptions or attendance fees, especially certain
    journal articles or conferences, respectively.

    this domain, why not take action and launch regular reading group or journal club
    meetings yourself? It’s a great way to stay on top of things, learn a new thing
    or two, and expand your network at the same time.
