    on what everyone’s saying about the introduction of the Code Interpreter. I’ve
    had access to it for the last month or so. And, honestly, I haven’t been that
    impressed.

    pretty cool stuff with basic data and it can be helpful for people with no exposure
    to coding. Plus, it allows multiple types of data to be uploaded and it can be
    particularly handy when it comes to basic data cleaning with regular expressions
    and iterating on simple data visualizations.

    most people would find this tool really useful for analyzing data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    ChatGPT doesn’t really have access to. My friend Luke Barousse talks a bit about
    this in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSkcsrFCCXM) as well.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your team gives you a solid, consistent, older model car. We’ll call it Python
    3.8\. Meanwhile, the newest supercars, Python 3.11, just rolled out with an awesome
    new feature called AutoFast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now Python 3.8 runs perfectly fine for most races. But, without the AutoFast
    feature of the later versions of Python, you just can’t hit the ultra high speeds
    on the straightaways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This mirrors how, in coding, Python 3.8 is great for many applications, but
    you’ll need to be updated to some of the later versions for some specific functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, this is also related to the Code Interpreter. To the best of my knowledge,
    it can only run Python version 3.8, while some libraries only work using later
    versions of Python.

    really can’t use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now OpenAI did do a decent job of including many useful packages for data analysis,
    but they definitely handcuff you if you want to explore new tools or libraries
    that are perhaps less commonly used. Here’s a list of what’s installed on the
    environment. It’s robust, but, again, definitely not exhaustive.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now for the last pitfall of the Code Interpreter. Let’s go back to our car metaphor.
    Our Code Interpreter has a pretty hefty fuel tank (the RAM) and a strong engine
    (the CPU), which is good for a normal race.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But for an intense next-level race, like machine learning, you need a turbo
    boost. While your race car is fine without the turbo boost, you’re missing out
    on some high-speed thrills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically for the Code Interpreter, you’re lacking a GPU, which is the turbo
    boost of the car metaphor. You really can’t fully exploit machine-learning capabilities
    without one of these.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From what I can find, the interpreter instance has reasonably good compute.
    It seems like it has around 54 gigabytes of RAM and a processor with 16 cores,
    which it reluctantly told me. Again, not super sure how accurate this information
    is, but this is likely sufficient for most basic tasks.
