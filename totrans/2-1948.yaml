    trucks) are more likely than smaller cars to kill or seriously injure pedestrians.
    We’ll acomplish this by fitting a logistic regression model, which will show us
    which factors are relevant in determining whether an injury will occur.

    can consume. That means we need to define out target variable (what we are trying
    to predict) and some features (what we’ll use to make the prediction).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In our case, the target variable is a binary value indicating whether a pedestrian
    was killed or severely injured the crash (1 = injury, 0 = no injury). This is
    easy to calculate from the People dataset. First we identify whether any of the
    people in the crash were pedestrians using the “person_type” field. Then we determine
    whether any pedestrian involved had an incapacitating or fatal injury using the
    “injury_classification” field. We’ll actually create two target variables here
    — one for incapacitating injuries, one for fatal injuries — and model them separately
    later. *(Note: the dataset defines an incapacitating injury as any injury that
    “prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or normally continuing the
    activities they were capable of performing”.)*'

    as the Vehicle dataset includes a classification that distinguishes cars, SUVs,
    pickup trucks, etc. However, vehicles are not consistently labeled in the dataset.
    For example, one officer might label a Toyota RAV4 as an SUV while another might
    label it as a car. In order to account for these discrepancies, we’ll check how
    each make/model is *most often* labeled and use that for all instances of that
    make/model. After that small bit of feature engineering, we can easily calculate
    two binary features for each crash: one indicating whether an SUV was involved,
    and one indicating whether a pickup truck was involved.'

    the outcome of a crash, such as weather conditions and the posted speed limit.

    model. We’ll be able to analyze the model to understand which features contribute
