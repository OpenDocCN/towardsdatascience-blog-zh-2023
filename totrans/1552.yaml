- en: Amazon is one of the major employers of Ph.D. graduates in economics and related
    fields, offering roles that closely align with those in data science and machine
    learning (ML/DS), particularly in causal inference. It is one of the few companies
    that offer positions explicitly titled ‘economist,’ yet these roles often mirror
    the responsibilities and skill sets required in causal inference data scientist
    tracks in other tech companies. As someone preparing to enter this niche at the
    intersection between economics and data science, I found the Amazon Economist
    interview process to be rich in insights applicable across both domains. In this
    article, I will share my experiences and preparation for the Amazon Economist
    interview, aiming to provide a resource for those looking to navigate similar
    paths, whether in Amazon or data science roles elsewhere. My goal is to shed light
    on the interview process, offering relevant insights and tips not only for aspiring
    economists at Amazon but also for ML/DS job seekers, particularly those interested
    in data scientist roles with a causal inference focus in the tech industry.

    an Amazon Economist role on LinkedIn: ‘Economist — Long-term Internship (10 months),
    Economic Decision Science (EDS),’ based in London. This caught my interest, so
    I decided to apply. Notably, this was one of the rare instances where I secured
    an interview invitation without relying on personal connections like references.
    The interview took place some time ago, and I believe enough time has passed for
    it to be appropriate for me to share my preparation process and experiences from
    this interview.'

    The role was centered around applying econometric models and using large data
    sets to solve real-world business problems that Amazon faced. The role was within
    the EDS team, which operates within the EU Stores business with a goal to optimize
    and automate decision-making. This role required a strong foundation in econometrics
    and basic familiarity with statistical programming tools such as Stata, R, or
    Python.

    Prior to the interview, I was briefed on its format. The interview, lasting an
    hour, was structured to include both behavioral and technical components. The
    behavioral segment focused on Amazon’s values, specifically their Leadership Principles,
    which you can find at [Amazon’s Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles).
    The technical part revolved around a role-specific business question. In my case,
    the question pertained to the application of econometric models to a scenario
    in Amazon’s retail sector.

    a good idea to download it beforehand and check its features, e.g., background
    blur, or to ensure that your mic and audio are configured correctly. Also, the
    recruiter lets you know who will be the interviewer. It might be a good idea to
    check them out beforehand to see their work. That way, you know more about to
    whom you are communicating and thus communicate accordingly. For me, the interviewer
    was an economist, which I appreciated.

    There were 2–3 situational questions relating to the Leadership Principles and
    some follow-ups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I made sure to prepare myself for potential interview questions by coming up
    with 1-2 stories for each of the key principles and practicing them out loud using
    either the STAR (situation, task, action, result) or CAR (context, action, result)
    frameworks. For more guidance, you can review common questions or examples for
    each principle to get an idea of what types of questions may come up during the
    interview.

    question relates to the “Invent and Simplify” principle, while the second one
    relates to the “Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit” or “Are Right, A Lot.” The
    interviewer might ask for further details on your stories, so be prepared. For
    example, I was asked as a follow-up to the first question about the potential
    risks of the simple solution and how I dealt with these risks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I kept my answers concise and left it up to the interviewer to ask for follow-ups
    if he wanted more details. It is also important to use “I” as the subject, rather
    than “we,” and not to talk negatively about anyone you have worked with when telling
    these stories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These stories were useful for my interviews with other companies, too. So, although
    these are Amazon leadership principles, many companies have similar values, and
    they’ll ask situational questions similar to these. Overall, preparing for this
    interview was quite useful for my interviews at other companies.

    matching, [synthetic control](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/synthdid-101-a-beginners-guide-to-synthetic-difference-in-differences-84fed9b730ae),
    instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and A/B testing (experimentation).
    Specifically, I reviewed which assumptions are necessary for these methods, how
    one can validate these assumptions, what the pitfalls are, and how to write out
    the equations for these or to calculate the standard errors.

    but to be able to come up with the answers on the spot and communicate these clearly,
    a review is necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also practiced some business case questions. It’s just as important to communicate
    effectively as it is to choose appropriate methods for the problem. There are
    several key aspects to keep in mind during a case interview. First, it’s essential
    to think aloud. This approach lets the interviewer understand your thought process
    and the rationale behind your chosen methods. Second, don’t hesitate to ask for
    clarification if any part of the problem is unclear. Third, engage in a dialogue
    with the interviewer and be open to their suggestions. In my experience, the interviewer
    provided helpful hints and guidance during the interview.

    the impact of a hypothetical price promotion at Amazon. The scenario described
    a bundle pricing deal: a 10% discount offered to customers purchasing any four
    products, each priced under 10 dollars. This promotion was implemented simultaneously
    across all regions. The challenge posed to me was: “How would you assess the impact
    of this promotion on Amazon’s profitability?”'

- en: Several factors need to be considered in assessing the impact of this promotion.
    On one hand, the promotion could be beneficial as it encourages customers to purchase
    more items, potentially reducing shipping costs due to bundling. On the other
    hand, the 10% discount might negatively impact profits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the interview, I asked about the availability of data to analyze this
    scenario. The interviewer said that I had access to product-level sales, transaction-level,
    and shipping cost data. With this information, I proposed several analytical methods,
    including conducting an [event study](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/event-studies-for-causal-inference-the-dos-and-donts-863f29ca7b65)
    and employing regression discontinuity. I also explained how I would utilize the
    available data to perform these analyses.

    being launched everywhere simultaneously, there was an experiment, and this promo
    was implemented in some states without randomization. The question that was asked
    was: “How would you use this experiment to measure the impact?” For this question,
    as far as I remember, I suggested a synthetic control approach.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The interviewer asked for my suggestions on a few other hypothetical scenarios.
    Some of the other follow-up questions were: “Imagine that profit goes down but
    revenue increases. What would you suggest then? Would you implement the promotion
    more extensively or not?” I think in these types of questions, you are expected
    to circle back to some of the leadership principles, such as “customer obsession,”
    but I am not sure. Though, these were definitely some interesting questions to
    think about.'

    that I might have. I had some questions prepared, for example, how the team works
    or what a day in life looks like. So, I asked these questions. The interviewer
    was very thorough in answering these questions, so I definitely appreciated that.
    If you are preparing for this sort of interview, you should also keep some questions
    ready to go.

- en: For the behavioral questions, I did not find them hard to answer, but I am not
    sure how powerful my stories were. So, I guess looking back, I might’ve tried
    to prepare more powerful stories. It might be good to find stories that are particularly
    relevant to the company’s culture and challenges.

- en: For the technical part, I found a few things challenging. One of them was to
    spell out the equations for your econometric models. During the whole interview,
    you are to convey your solutions verbally. I had no issue communicating the overall
    approach and assumptions this way, but specifying the regressions out loud was
    challenging. You are also expected to specify the subscripts, etc. I am used to
    writing the equations down, but I was not very good at saying them out loud. I
    also had a hard time deciding what would be the best outcome metric for the regression,
    e.g., sales or profit.

- en: Originally, there were two rounds of interviews planned at Amazon, but my journey
    concluded after the first round. As such, the insights I’m sharing are based on
    my initial and sole experience with the Amazon interview process. Reflecting on
    this, I’d like to emphasize to those preparing for similar interviews, whether
    at Amazon or in data science roles with a focus on causal inference, the importance
    of not just honing in on behavioral questions and technical methodologies. Equally
    crucial is the ability to tackle business problems, particularly those specific
    to the role’s context. In my instance, the emphasis was on the retail sector.
    Looking back, dedicating more time to reviewing retail-specific scenarios would
    have been advantageous. Since my usual work doesn’t involve retail data, a deeper
    dive into this domain would have aided in swiftly identifying the best metrics
    and articulating my ideas more clearly. This approach is not only beneficial for
    economist roles at Amazon, but it is also a valuable strategy for any data science
    professional venturing into industry-specific roles, where contextual understanding
    is critical to demonstrating expertise and problem-solving abilities.
