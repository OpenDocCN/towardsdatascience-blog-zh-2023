    will take some holidays this year. Now that the worst (fingers crossed) of the

    conducting analyses on topics out of the strictly professional world is a good
    exercise to stay “in the game of data analytics”. Whether you are a junior or
    a more advanced data analyst, I find it always useful to **train with new datasets

    and to investigate if tourism is back to its pre-crisis levels. This could be
    seen worldwide or the scope could be narrowed down to a restricted geographical
    area. As I live in Europe I am particularly interested in **analyzing the impact
    of the COVID crisis on tourism in Europe.**

    various fields such as transportation (by plane, by train, by car…), touristic
    sites (museums, events…), accommodation (hotels, camping sites, home-stays…).
    To be more precise in the issue I want to analyze here, let’s **focus on accommodation**.'

    to reach its pre-crisis level**. Although the 2022 summer seasons has not exactly
    reach the values of 2019 (-15% in July-August 2022 versus July-August 2019), the
    evolution is showing a positive trend compared to 2020 and 2021\. It would be
    interesting to conduct the same analysis next year when the 2023 summer season
    is over.

    comment does not always apply. For example Spain values in 2022 are very close
    to 2019 values (-4% only for July-August) while for others 2022 is far below 2019
    (-26% in Czechia).'

    based on the analysis of one metric is necessarily partial. To be able to draw
    a fully accurate conclusion about the state of tourism in Europe, one should **analyze
    several metrics**, compare the results of these analyses and consolidate the lessons
    learned from them.
