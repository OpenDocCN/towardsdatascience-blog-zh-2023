- en: I spent countless hours during my early career adding layers upon layers of
    complexity to my projects, hoping to impress potential employers with my technical
    skills and ability to juggle intricate algorithms. Over time, I realized that
    this approach was not only counterproductive but also a misrepresentation of how
    I’d deliver work on the job.

    I’m making the case for emphasizing ease of running and user-friendliness over
    complexity, to showcase a more accurate understanding of real-world data science
    tasks.

- en: When I was around a year into my career in data science, I had to build a model
    to calculate baseline web traffic for our attribution model. I immediately saw
    my chance to show off. I went through iterations of ARIMA, Prophet, etc, looking
    to showcase my machine learning skills. I settled on a random forest implementation.

    had to tell them the inner workings were a bit of a black box. I was met with
    blank faces. My manager pulled me aside afterward and suggested I try something
    that can be fully explained in one PowerPoint slide (post-it note that advice
    on your monitor). Almost joking with myself, I tried a rolling median. It was
    right in the middle of the reasonably tight error score pack.

- en: We went back to the high-ups with “tuning updates” and all I had to say was
    rolling average and nobody so much as questioned it. Five years and multiple attribution
    model iterations later, that baseline calculation remains in production without
    any need for retraining or model drift monitoring. It’s handled hundreds of millions
    of dollars of ad spend and is one of the few elements of our work that hasn’t
    faced quibbles from a probing client.

    highlights a critical point. Complex projects can easily become unwieldy, difficult
    to understand, and as such, harder to execute. Such projects provide diminishing
    value to both you and those reviewing your work.

    It’s about your understanding of the field’s principles, your capacity to create
    practical, user-friendly solutions that can be easily implemented and run, and
    most importantly, your ability to tell a compelling story with data.

    An elaborate portfolio project might show technical prowess, but it doesn’t reflect
    your capacity to create practical solutions that align with business objectives
    and constraints. Such pursuit of complexity might not just misrepresent the demands
    of real-world data science, but also overlook the very essence of the discipline:
    leveraging data to create impactful, easily understandable, and actionable insights.'

- en: The last time my team was hiring, I was legitimately stoked to see so many portfolio
    links on the resumes. I was quickly disappointed to see more than half of them
    were a couple of repos containing a single Jupyter notebook, no instructions,
    and in-notebook markdown that didn’t go beyond one-liner descriptions of code
    blocks. I gave almost everyone who had instructions and requirements files an
    interview — the bar really can be that low.

    employers. Yes, GitHub displays your notebook contents, but if a hiring manager
    looking for your work can clone the repo, follow your README file, and run all
    your code without changing anything, you’re going to find yourself near the top
    of the candidate list.

    Being able to produce code that is both maintainable and understandable by others

    your work. I struggled immensely in school, always knowing the class content yet
    never being able to test well. My school life became not about how to get A-grades,
    but how to simply pass tests where the stakes were my entire future.
