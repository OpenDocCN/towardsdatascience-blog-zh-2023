- en: Association rule mining is a rule-based machine learning technique used to find
    frequent patterns in a data set. Frequent patterns may include frequent itemsets
    that are usually bought together or subsequences that are bought in sequence.
    For example, cookies and coffee can be *frequent itemset* for a cafe, and a laptop
    and external monitor can be a *subsequence* for an electronics store. Finding
    frequent patterns in a transactional database and detecting associations between
    items is an extremely popular data science use case. Some application areas are
    item recommendations, cross-selling, promotion design, customer behavior analysis,
    and inventory management.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A basket is a collection of items that are selected by the user such as items
    in a shopping cart or content consumed on a website. Market basket analysis helps
    us to learn **associations** between items in the inventory and therefore, we
    can leverage historical data to predict user purchase behavior and recommend items
    to the users without knowing extra information about them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Market basket analysis is based on discovering associations between items by
    using **association rules** which take the form of if-then relationships. To build
    an association rule, we should have at least one **antecedent** and one **consequent**.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Support is the main metric to measure how interesting and important a rule is.
    It can be applied to a single item or pair of antecedents and consequents. It
    is calculated by dividing the number of transactions including certain item(s)
    by the number of total transactions. Support value ranges from 0 to 1.

    It assumes the occurrence of item A in a transaction is independent of the occurrence
    of item B if *P*(*A* ∪ *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*), otherwise these two items are
    dependent and so **correlated**. It is calculated by dividing the proportion of
    transactions that contain items A and B by the proportion of item A and item B
    that takes place independently. The lift value ranges from 0 to infinity.

    together and having item A and item B as they were independent. It is calculated
    by extracting the proportion of item A and item B that takes place independently
    from the proportion of transactions that contain items A and B. Leverage value
    ranges between -1 and 1.

    'confidence', 'lift', 'leverage', 'conviction', or 'zhangs_metric'` ) and set
    a minimum threshold value for that. Here, I selected ‘confidence’ as evaluation
    metric and set the minimum threshold as 0.5\. Feel free to change the metric based
    on the rule of interest.
