    have been quite busy each November — thanks to a fun challenge called the [#30DayMapChallange](https://30daymapchallenge.com).
    Each year, this challenge has a thematic schedule, proposing a topic that should
    be the primary directive for map visualisation to be posted on that particular
    day. While the pre-defined daily topics certainly mean a constraint for the creative
    mind, they also help participants to find mutual interest, share data sources,
    and express individual styles visually and technologically.

    detailing and showing the different maps I created — usually in Python using various
    tools of spatial analytics and geospatial data.

    the end, I defaulted to my background in Physics and decided to draw up the Earth’s
    magnetic field with its [Main Field Declination lines](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model).
    These lines, as magnetic poles, can either be positive or negative. The [Earth’s
    magnetic](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b9045c4d1aa408694d3759d1aa5ede4)
    north pole is defined by these lines — which is not always up. Its moving! In
    recent years, it started migrating from the Canadian Arctic towards Russia at
    a speed of several kilometres per year.

    Budapest home, particularly District V. and District VI. in Pest and visualised
    its building height profile based on [ATLO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/35472656)
    s Budapest Open Data Atlas. As for the tech part, I used Python as always and
    finally learned the basics of Pydeck to create this piece. Enjoy the interactive
    version [here](https://www.janosov.com/DAY23.html), each building height being
    proportional to its actual height, which information is also encoded in the colour
    sharing:.

    great examples on beautiful Joy-division album-cover-styled maps. I used the [Python
    version implemented by Colin Carroll](https://github.com/ColCarroll/ridge_map).
    To the technical end, the elevation data used by ridge_map comes from NASA’s Shuttle
    Radar Topography Mission. The only slight change I added in my notebook is that
    I hooked the bounding box part up to [OSMNx](http://osmnx.readthedocs.io), so
    now one just has to type the name of the area they wish to visualise.

    Budapest, especially its elevation contour lines collected from the B[udapest
    Open Data Portal](https://atlo.team/boda/). The map clearly shows how the Danube
    split the city in half, how plain the Pest side is on the right (at around 100m
    above sea level), and how the Buda hills look down on it from a whopping height
    of 500m!

    which has a nice rasterised population map of Budapest (for more on population
    raster data, also [check my tutorial on TDS](/exploring-large-scale-raster-population-data-72803cf7f2ad))!
    Then, I turned each grid cell into the POI of its polygon and drew each POI with
    a marker with a size proportional to the number of inhabitants in the corresponding
    grid cell. Then, I coloured each dot red, blue, and white at random to give it
    this slightly old-school 3d vibe (I also have to admit, I became the biggest one
    of the neon red-blue colour palette this year, somewhat inspired by Star Wars).

    This map essentially shows how much a particular city — here, a whole bunch of
    European cities — stretches out. This can easily be captured by measuring the
    total length of road segments whose orientation falls into a certain bin (e.g.
    between 0 and 5 degrees). Then, turning these into polar bar plots, we arrive
    at this interesting digital footprint of city road networks:'
