- en: Radial bar charts are a visually attractive alternative to traditional bar charts.
    Data are plotted on a polar coordinate system instead of the conventional cartesian
    coordinate system. This allows the bars to be represented by rings rather than
    as vertical bars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Radial bar charts can make a great and visually appealing graphic to include
    in a presentation or poster if you are looking to catch the reader's attention.
    However, as with many data visualisations, they have their own drawbacks. One
    issue that can arise is that they can be challenging to interpret. This is because
    our visual system is much better at interpreting straight lines when comparing
    values between categories. Additionally, rings towards the centre of the radial
    bar chart become harder to read and compare with those further out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This article will show how to create a visually appealing radial bar plot using
    the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library from [Python](https://www.python.org/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is mentioned, most people think about
    basic charts that are poorly formatted and need multiple lines of awkward or confusing
    code to display a great chart.

    are going to use. For this tutorial, we will need to import [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
    [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/).

    most common formats for storing data in Python is the pandas dataframe.

    function or created manually from lists or dictionaries.

    will have multiple lithologies and a count of how often that lithology appears
    within a specific interval of a well.

    string in the form of `Lithology (Count)`.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create the plot, we first begin by creating the figure as we would with any
    other matplotlib chart. We will also pass in a few parameters to the `plt.figure()`
    call. The first is the figure size, which we will set to 10 x 10\. This can be
    set to any size you want, but this size gives a good plot for viewing on screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we will pass in the `linewidth` and `edgecolor` parameters. These will
    add a 10 px border around our plot which will have a slightly different colour
    to the plot background.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next step is to add an axis to our chart that uses polar coordinates rather
    than cartesian coordinates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, before we add the axis, we first have to create the shape of the axis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is done by creating a variable called `rect` and assigning it to a list
    containing 4 numbers. These numbers represent the starting position (x and y coordinates),
    the height and the width.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we want to add some padding to our radial bar chart, we need to set the width
    and height parameters to a value less than 1\. In this case, we will set it to
    0.8, representing 80% of the available width and height.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE7]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We can then create a new axis using `fig.add_axes` and pass in the `rect` list,
    along with setting the polar argument to true and removing the axis frame.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following that, we need to set the radial bars to start from the top of the
    plot, which is North (N), and we will set the bars to radiate in a counter-clockwise
    direction. If we wanted the bars to go clockwise, then we would change the `set_theta_direction()`
    to -1.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To add some visual interest to our plot, we will add some faint bars that go
    from 0 to the maximum value. This gives the illusion of bar portions that have
    yet to be filled.
  prefs: []

- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As we want a space for our labels in the top right of our plot, we will set
    the bars only to complete 3/4 of a full circle. This is done with the following
    piece of code, which is passed into the call to `ax_polar_bg.barh.`

    to adding the faint background bars.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the `set_rgrids()` function, we will pass in a list with 0 to 6\. These
    numbers represent the radii for the radial gridlines. Also, we will pass in the
    labels and set their appearance within this function. To have the labels appear
    in the top right of our plot and adjacent to the starting point of the rings,
    we need to set the angle to 0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the radial grid has been set up, we need to loop through each category
    within the dataframe and add a ring to the chart using the `barh()` function within
    matplotlib.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with the previous section of code, we only want the rings to go 3/4 of the
    way around, so we need to multiply pi by 1.5 instead of 2.
