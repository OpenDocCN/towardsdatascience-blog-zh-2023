- en: Even though I got my Ph.D. in Network and Data Science, I have always stayed
    close to my roots, especially in Physics, whenever seeking inspiration. Growing
    up in Hungary, I was particularly amazed by the achievements of “The Martians,”
    a group of renowned scientists who emigrated from Hungary to the US around World
    War II. Interestingly, some of them even went to the same high school.

    theory of nuclear chain reaction but also co-patented the refrigerator with Albert
    Einstein and Eugene Wigner–a key scientist at the Manhattan Project–leading the
    development of the first nuclear reactor. For his contributions, Wigner received
    the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, numbering among the 18 Nobel Prizes that have
    been linked to thinkers with Hungarian origins.

    awarded. In fact, since 1901, about 600 prizes have gone to somewhat less than
    a thousand laureates in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine,
    Literature, Peace, and–starting in 1969–Economics. The site NobelPrize.org highlights
    other exciting statistics about the prize and its awardees: from the youngest
    (17 years old) and oldest (97) laureates to multiple-prize winners such as John
    Bardeen (Physics, 1956 and 1972), Linus Pauling (Chemistry 1954, Peace 1962),
    and [Marie Skłodowska-Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/)

    her husband, Pierre, and later received a second award. Additionally, the mighty
    couple produced a Nobel-winning heir. Their daughter, Irène Curie, who shared
    the recognition with her husband, Frédéric Joliot, was awarded the prize in the
    field of Chemistry in 1935\. Marie Curie was a member of another fabulous example
    of the interlinked small world of laureates (sadly, Pierre passed away in 1906):
    the Solvay Conference on Physics in 1911\. It was probably the most impressive
    line-up in science ever: 27 of the 29 participants had either already won, or
    later received, the Nobel Prize.'

- en: The stories of the Martians, the Curie family, the Manhattan Project, and the
    Solvay Conference all suggest that, behind the scenes, some seriously intertwined
    social networks are at work among Nobel laureates. To trace this network, I went
    to the most widely used online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and collected the Wiki
    page text of each laureate.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, in each laureate’s page text, I counted the mentions of all the other
    names, noting whether any pairings shared a common history noteworthy for Wikipedia.
    This way, I built a network of 682 nodes and 588 links, where nodes correspond
    to laureates, and the strength of the link between two nodes is proportional to
    the number of times their Wiki sites reference each other. Additionally, I downloaded
    the total view count of each laureate’s page and set their network node size proportional
    to the logarithm of that number. This node scaling eventually highlighted those
    that have become household names. To finalize the network visualization, I applied
    color coding that corresponds to the scientific disciplines. You may find the
    result in Figure 1.

    based on the cross-references between their Wikipedia pages. Each node corresponds
    to a laurate, edge widths measure the number of cross references, and node size
    is proportional to the total view count of their Wiki pages. Color encodes the
    disciplines they were awarded (in the case of multiple different awards, a color
    was picked at random from the awarded disciplines). Nodes with the highest view
    counts are labeled.

    the network is its core-periphery separation: a large, connected component in
    the center (a so-called giant component) which contains more than 30 percent of
    the nodes, and a fragmented ring around it with smaller network components, with
    sizes up to ten nodes. The most frequent component sizes are as few as two and
    three nodes, which aligns well with the fact that the Nobel Prize can be shared
    among a maximum of three laureates, and shared prizes are becoming more and more
    common in the majority of fields.'
  id: totrans-20

- en: I also realized that nodes in the giant component are larger, meaning significantly
    higher visibility and a greater number of search hits for those laureates, as
    measured by logarithm of their Wiki view counts. After looking into the data,
    it turns out that the median Wiki-view count is 351,005 in the central component,
    while only 170,510 for the outer ring, and the average view count value is about
    2.5 times higher for the central component than for the outer ring. So it seems,
    the central clique is way more popular!

    Wiki 浏览量中位数为 351,005，而外环组件仅为 170,510，并且中央组件的平均浏览量大约是外环组件的 2.5 倍。因此，看起来中央 clique
    的人气远远更高！
- en: But who are they? The coloring with the green-yellowish shades versus reddish
    tones is meant to distinguish sciences from humanities, coinciding with the left
    and right sides of the giant component. These sides are linked by Sir James Chadwick,
    who won the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the neutron and who also
    became a scientific advisor to the United Nations. The science side (Figure 2a),
    headlining researchers like Albert Einstein and Max Planck, seems to have a strong
    root in the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1700–1945) and is also strong amongst
    the founders of modern Physics, from the Curies to Enrico Fermi and Eugene Wigner
    or György Hevesy (both with Hungarian and Martian roots).

    Apparently, science is not the way to world fame! There are immediately two central
    laureate organizations that strike the eye: the European Union and the United
    Nations, both awarded Nobel Peace Prizes. Notable individuals include prominent
    politicians, such as Barack Obama or Henry Kissinger, the human rights activist
    Nelson Mandela, and the economist Milton Friedman (with Hungarian, but non-Martian,
    roots).'

- en: As for the outer parts, there are a few famously social individuals, such as
    Ernest Hemingway, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Richard Feynman
    — personally, my favorite Nobel laureate for both his scientific contribution
    and his playful and eccentric personality. These individuals, despite living busy
    lives, are somewhat isolated from the network, likely due to the time and geographical
    locations of their active years compared to other laureates. Additionally, the
    data may be incomplete here as Wikipedia is neither perfect nor 100 percent accurate
    in documenting social connections, and sadly (or not?), Facebook did not exist
    at that time.

    Facebook。
- en: 'Finally, the Hungarians and the Martians: looking at the data, it turns out
    that many of them are not connected to even a single Nobel laureate, and those
    who are members of the network are simply scattered around. The reasons behind
    this are unclear — maybe the legend of the Martians is overrated, or maybe there
    weren’t enough of them awarded a Nobel to appear in the network visibility. One
    thing is for sure, though: the Manhattan Project counted seven Nobel laureates
    while it was operational and, later, a dozen more, but among them only Wigner
    was from the Martians.'

    Network, and despite how it makes me truly feel as if I’m “standing on the shoulders
    of giants,” the network has its flaws. Besides the peripheral Eastern Europeans,
    we see an elite club emerging in the center with the majority of popular names
    clustered together in the giant component, excluding two-thirds of the network.
    This suggests that two-thirds of the laureates just walk away with the prize and
    go back to their work, and only the remaining third engage in visible connections,
    be it friendships or collaborations. As “The whole is greater than the sum of
    the parts,” missing more than 60 percent of those brilliant minds from the central
    flow of ideas seems a pity.

    into two camps: science and humanities. This polarization very much goes against
    today’s main direction, interdisciplinary research, which gives us the power to
    tackle major societal problems never experienced before. Additionally, the network
    reveals the low number of female laureates. Despite the exceptional history of
    Marie Curie, only about six percent of laureates were female, most of whom were
    awarded the Peace Prize (16.5 percent of 109 awarded) and the least of whom earned
    awards in Physics (1.8 percent of 219 awarded).'

    issues, which otherwise are barely visible, even to the most avid Nobel fans.
    Zooming out and utilizing network science can highlight otherwise hidden patterns

    be it about gender gaps or elitist cliques.
