    says that it can play but it is not a perfect player (is this an excuse if it
    loses the game ? ).

    nonsense analysis by ChatGPT, said that I moved the queen to connect my rooks
    and support d4, however, I don’t even have a pawn in d4\. This weird analysis
    confirms the fact that it is not tracking any board position.

- en: In conclusion, ChatGPT 3.5 cannot play a chess match, the Large Language Model
    is not tracking the board and checking for legal/illegal moves. ChatGPT uses the
    trained dataset to infer the next move from previous matches but it is confusing
    these matches and does not analyze the actual board position and how to play this
    position. We can assume that ChatGPT doesn’t have the knowledge about the game
    to produce logical decisions, even after saying in the beginning that it was trained
    with chess rules, information, and strategies.

    a strong set of rules that GPT 3.5 was not able to learn yet, and RL models or
    search models still being better for this type of problem. For now my ChessAI
    model, a chess expert model, still doing better!

    4.0\. GPT 4.0 is better than 3.5 on chess? It will be able to play a whole match?
