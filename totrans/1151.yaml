    value, mission, and vision. Data is the cornerstone of strategy, planning, risks,
    process improvements, governance, and more under the sun. Data professionals process
    millions of gigabytes analyzing data, finding implicit insights to address problems,
    creating tools, and leading the decision-making for a business.

    must be a way to maximize the potential of the tools and solutions we architect.
    With this blog, I want to change the way you think and give you a new lens to

    with multiple components to the structure, including its interface, an API, or
    command-line SQL. For example, a data product can be a Consumer-360 dashboard
    that combines consumer demographics, and marketing initiatives with predicted
    and historical sales, market share, and everything under the consumer umbrella.

    without realizing the value you add. Data products use a range of data science
    & analytics efforts such as predictive analytics, descriptive data modeling, data
    mining, machine learning, risk management, and a variety of analysis methods to
    translate the data to non-data people.

    as data professionals, we need to catch up and switch from a project-centric mindset
    to a product-centric perspective. Organizations today strive to achieve business
    goals through data-informed decisions. Now you ask yourself, who will drive these
    insights for the company to adopt? — Data Products.

    defined efforts in time and money and once the project is complete, you may move
    on. Now, a **data product** is not only designed to address the problem and solve
    it, but the product can also live through multiple stages until its value is realized.

    advantages for the company, improve services or products, optimize economic value
    and most importantly, as a data professional, you instill confidence in things
    you create.

    to be impactful to the business. Data products with a defined mission to solve
    a real problem within a well-defined scope are all you need. After all, the value
    generated by data products is not related to the use of technology, but to its
    use and practical application.

    and the UI. The speed of iteration matters and therefore, while developing your
    data product, you can eye to keep your model simple — one that does the job without
    much heavy lifting.

    and fuel the business.
