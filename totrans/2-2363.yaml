- en: Most of us know the Earth is spherical, or more accurately an ellipsoid. The
    fact that we have to represent a curved 3-dimensional surface to a 2-dimensional
    flat piece of paper or screen means that some distortions are involved. This method
    of “projecting” the Earth’s surface to a 2D image is called a **map projection**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are hundreds of map projections, and each of them minimises **distortion**
    in the **shape, distance, area and direction** in various degrees. However, no
    map projection can eliminate them all, hence understanding the pros and cons of
    each projection is essential to determine what to use for your project.

    when viewed from space. This type of projection is known as a **planar projectio**n,
    where the Earth’s surface is projected on a flat, imaginary plane.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, we can only view one hemisphere in this flat plane, and distortions
    of all forms occur when we move from the centre of the map and are especially
    pronounced towards the edges. We seldom see this projection used, except for aesthetic
    purposes or any cases when we want to inject some realism into our map.

    the most recognisable of all projections. Google Maps uses a variant of this called
    the **Pseudo Mercator** or **Web Mercator**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for its popularity is that it preserves shapes and angles very well,
    which is essential for the navigation of ships in the past and our current use
    of digital map applications to view the shapes of the territorial borders and
    then zoom in while keeping the shapes intact.

    the equator touching it. Then the cylinder is unrolled to display as a world map.
    CSS Notice the expansion of latitudes the further it is from the equator for this
    Mercator projection. (Created by author)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Mercator is a type of **cylindrical projection** with the equator touching
    the cylinder, hence only the stripe along the equator is not distorted in terms
    of its area. The distortion becomes more significant and exaggerated the further
    we move to the poles.

- en: A good example is that in the Mercator projected world map above, you can see
    that Greenland is about the same size as the continent of Africa. But in reality,
    Greenland is 14 times smaller than Africa, or just 7% of Africa’s area!

    least distortion at the equator because it is touching the imaginary cylinder.
    This knowledge is used to make another very popular projection called the Transverse
    Mercator.

    longitude is projected and used. (Created by author)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of the cylinder being upright, and touching the equator, it is “traversed”
    so that a particular length of longitude touches the cylinder. Only this narrow
    stripe is used since it has the least distortions. There are many variants of
    transverse Mercator, but the logic of projection is similar. The difference is
    where the **central meridian** (the longitudinal line which touches the cylinder)
    is and the width of the stripe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This unique, narrow zone or stripe of projection is used widely for land surveys
    with a North-South extent because of its accuracy. For the same reason, meters
    (or feet in the United States) are used instead of latitude and longitude as units
    of the coordinates.

    and used among the Transverse Mercator projections. It projects along each stripe
    of longitude and hence divides the Earth equally into 60 longitudinal stripes
    or zones, with each of these zones being **6 degrees latitude-wide**.

    on the world map but have to use another projection to display it as above. As
    you realise, due to the narrow width, many countries and states have their territorial
    areas overlapping multiple UTM zones.

    has its national projection, called SVY21 (Singapore Vertical Datum 2021). This
    makes sense as Singapore is a tiny country. While it is located within the UTM
    zone of 48, it will still experience distortions since it is not at the central
    meridian of that zone.

    and then unrolled.

    the Earth at a point. This line called a **standard parallel**, is the line where
    the area projected has the least distortion.

    at **mid-latitudes** and with an **east-west** mass spread where the standard
    parallel is placed. This cannot be achieved accurately from the previously stated
    planar and cylindrical projections.

    and direction along the standard parallel, hence it is used widely for creating

    of distortions or excel only in limited ranges. The Robinson projection is good
    at minimising all distortions of the world to an extent. Hence, it is often considered
    a compromise between different types of distortions.

    longitudes are curved to minimise distortions. Another similar projection is the
    **Winkel Tripel projection** which the United Nations uses for its [world map](https://www.un.org/geospatial/content/map-world)
    at this point of writing.

    classified into three families of projection surfaces and hopefully, the reasons
    why they are used are obvious to you now. Of course, this is a much more complicated
    topic if we go even deeper, but the fundamentals shown here should suffice to
    explore on your own.
