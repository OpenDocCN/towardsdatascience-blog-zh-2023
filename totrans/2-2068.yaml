    most industries. Gartner reports, "[*Venture capital firms have invested over
    $1.7 billion in generative AI solutions over the last three years.*](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/beyond-chatgpt-the-future-of-generative-ai-for-enterprises)"
    It is, without a doubt, that LLMs will influence most areas of Data Architecture.

    influence them.

    how it helps expedite the editing process of any written form of content. Similarly,
    co-pilots will take the main stage in most of our work, including Data Architecture.

    setting standards, and implementing governance structures. Co-pilots like [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/)
    can help finish off sentences in an email and create announcements based on spec
    documents. Similarly, a co-pilot for a Data Architect can complete [entity-relationship
    diagrams](https://soft-builder.com/ai-powered-er-diagrams-generation/) (ERD) based
    solely on user requirements by understanding your design constraints. Co-pilots
    can work alongside the architect and help expedite their daily process.

    and reduce overhead costs by finding efficiencies. Similarly, the implementation
    of co-pilots will see a reduction in human resources due to more reliance on AI-led
    task completion. Tasks such as writing design documents, following approved patterns
    to create data architecture diagrams, creating data models and associated SQL
    queries, auditing SQLs against approved standards etc.*'

    when you add context to it. And "data context" is a [multi-billion dollar industry.](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/08/16/2499432/0/en/With-9-1-CAGR-Enterprise-Data-Management-Market-Size-Worth-USD-130-6-Billion-by-2028-Global-Industry-Trends-Share-Value-Analysis-Forecast-Report-by-Facts-Factors.html)

- en: Data context includes business or technical metadata, governance or privacy
    needs, and accessibility or security requirements. Although this industry was
    expected to double by 2028, I wonder how much of that growth will be capitalised
    by LLMs. As an example, using [Semantic Embeddings and Vector databases,](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
    organisations will be able to quickly contextualise data without needing to implement
    extensive data-context tools. If I can detect anomalies using Embeddings, do I
    need a comprehensive governance framework? This enforces point 1 of further cost
    optimisation due to LLMs.

- en: Embedding (pun intended!) AI in the data pipelines, transformations and lineages
    can help build context. And this context can be relied upon to answer end-user
    questions for analytics or regulatory needs. For example, does this data contain
    personal information? If it does, filter it out from specific analytics use cases.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the source system is not designed with analytics in mind, or multiple sources
    of truth exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ecosystem needs to mirror the offering from consumer companies like Apple.
    A key product with various supporting composable products that are useful individually
    but collectively creates a mind-blowing ecosystem. As an example, a data product
    marketplace (iPhone) displays information from the data observability framework
    (Watch) and is governed by a single access method (Face ID). Data Architecture
    will be in an ecosystem where integration is no longer a weakness. And this will
    be a game-changer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An ecosystem will also reduce the risk of information redundancy across disparate
    sources (like your iMessages sync across all your devices). There are already
    [startups](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/narrator-raises-6-2m-for-a-new-approach-to-data-modelling-that-replaces-star-schema/)
    looking at revolutionising this using concepts such as OBT (One Big Table). Ecosystems
    also mean data definitions; standards are set once and propagated through each
    area, reducing the cost of replication.

- en: '*For example, a customer transactional table captures information from the
    CRM system; by default, the CRM is designed to capture the mandatory fields required
    for analytics [1]. Once the data is transferred, it goes through a series of data
    quality checks to ensure its fit for purpose [2]. Once it is transformed, the
    reconciliation information is captured to assure that the data has not gone missing
    [3]. Before consumption, it is classified into personal data buckets and appropriate
    governance harnesses are set [4]. All these processes are important in themselves;
    however, they are significantly more powerful; when the data is finally productised,
    you can visualise [1] — [4] for that dataset and, in turn, trust that data.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As if Modern Data Stack didn't have its own hype, we now have the GenAI hype
    to contend with. It will be interesting to see how these trends unfold over the
    next 12–18 months. I expect companies that have already invested in the foundations
    to capitalise on these trends and those that did not invest in data quality or
    governance to lag behind continually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The underlying ask for all these trends is **good data.** You can't co-pilot,
    add context or have an effective data architecture without good data. It is one
    of the hardest things to achieve, but consequently, the biggest ROI.
