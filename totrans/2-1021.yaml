    hooks the audience from the beginning, maintains a steady cadence in delivering
    their address, focuses on the key details, and has a clear resolution by the end
    of their story. It’s no secret why this framework has such a universal appeal
    — narrative structures in storytelling can be found in every culture on Earth,
    transcending ethnic and economic backgrounds. They tap into fundamental aspects
    of human cognition and emotion, making them highly effective tools for communication,
    education, and persuasion. Furthermore, information presented in this narrative
    format is far easier to remember due to its structure, typically following a logical
    sequence — listeners are more likely to recall details when they are part of a
    story or form a recognisable pattern.

    ideas can be simplified and presented in a coherent manner, making them easier
    to comprehend. Contextualising information in the form of a logical plot gives
    presenters a powerful method for drawing in their audience, keeping them engaged
    throughout, and ensuring that their address stays with them long after they leave

    to build a narrative structure into your presentations, and how to deliver this
    story to your audience in order to keep them engaged and receptive to your message.
    This will mainly come from the perspective of data delivery techniques such as
    adding narrative elements to visualisations, contextualising complex information
    with callouts and annotations — though I will also touch on keeping your address
    focused on your underlying message, and how to use tone to your advantage when
    delivering the data. Additionally, I will describe the different kinds of approaches
    used in narrative visualisation, and show a typical approach for developing a
    leading narrative using Matplotlib.

    let’s first assert some guiding principles for preparing your presentation:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Define Your Key Message:*** Establish the primary objective of your presentation
    from the outset — your key message encapsulates the fundamental idea you intend
    to convey, acting as the guiding principle for every aspect of your presentation.
    A clearly defined message clarifies your purpose and ensures that every slide,
    phrase, and visual element works in lockstep with each other, creating a unified
    and influential presentation.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Organize Your Content:*** Well-organized presentations progress logically,
    leading your audience through a coherent sequence of ideas. Begin with a compelling
    introduction that captures their attention, followed by the body where your main
    points are discussed systematically, and conclude with a strong summary that reinforces
    your key message. Each section of your presentation should seamlessly lead to
    the next, providing a natural flow and enhancing the overall consistency of your
    message.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Use Visuals Wisely:*** Visuals are powerful tools for conveying information
    in a presentation. When used judiciously, visuals such as charts and graphs can
    demonstrate your key points and enhance overall understanding. The key lies in
    selecting visuals that directly support your message, ensuring they are clear,
    pertinent, and easy to interpret. Visuals should function as essential components
    that complement your address, adding depth to your presentation. For data-heavy
    presentations, this is especially important— more on this point in the next section.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Stay Focused:*** Respect the audience’s time and attention, and resist the
    urge to stray off-topic or delve into unnecessary details. A focused presentation
    is concise, relevant, and direct — it demands clarity in thought and delivery,
    and avoids digressions that might weaken the impact of your message. This ensures
    that your audience receives the most important information from your address,
    reinforcing the significance of your core message.'

    basic guidelines form the backbone of an impactful presentation, facilitating
    communication between the speaker and listener. Now let’s look at how to enhance
    the graphics in your presentations, by using narrative visualisation techniques
    to give context to your audience.

    emphasises exploration — the viewer takes a pivotal role in uncovering the narrative
    for themselves, with minimal guidance involved. Business intelligence applications
    like PowerBI and Tableau are prime examples of this form of storytelling, where
    interactive dashboards allow the viewer to dive into the data on their own.'

    of the data without imposing a specific storyline. Typically supporting narratives
    provide context without taking any particular viewpoint on the comtent— in this
    sense it’s arguably not a form of narrative at all, as no specific perspective
    (narrator or viewer) is taken on the data.'

    — this is an important point to ensure your audience gets the full meaning of
    what you’re explaining to them. A [1967 study by Mehrabian](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0024532)
    asserts that only 7% of communication is verbal — 38% is based on vocal tone,
    and 55% is based on facial expressions. Therefore to convey your full message,
    be mindful of what tone you use, and what expression you’re wearing when you say
    it.

    Voss talks about this concept called the ‘’late night FM DJ voice” — a low and
    slow tone of voice ideal for the tense situations he’s been a party to, which
    moves both the speaker and the listener into a calm and receptive frame of mind.
    You may wonder how the advice of an FBI negotiator is relevant to your presentations
    — this tone is often the kind of approach necessary when speaking to stakeholders
    on tense or contentious points, and a clear measured delivery is essential for
    making yourself clear while projecting a perception of calm collectedness to the

    hypothetical audience, this information should be delivered in a sobering but
    optimistic tone to underpin the gravity of the situation, while also highlighting
    the steps taken so far and the work that still needs to be done. In this way,
    the audience takes away two key points from this address — that the climate emergency
    we face is a real and serious threat, and that there are actions that can still
    be done to mitigate or eliminate the threats posed by climate change.

    I use in preparing a presentation, which includes defining your key message, organising
    your key points, and staying on topic. I described the different approaches to
    telling a narrative from the data, before walking through key techniques on preparing
    a leading narrative using a matplotlib plot of climate data trends, to make the
    story behind the data more evident for the audience. Lastly, I gave some brief
    notes on tone when delivering this data to a prospective audience, ensuring the
    full measure of your message is delivered with the right cadence and emphasis.
    By incorporating these techniques into your presentation, you will have the tools
    necessary to properly guide your audience’s understanding of the data, and ensure
    a lasting impact from your address.
