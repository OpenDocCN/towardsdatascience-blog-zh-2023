    the spatial resolution of the 13 bands range from 10 to 60 meters. A few highlights:'

    the full tile into an RGB image, then read it, conduct a histogram equalization
    following official [instructions](https://fire.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/figure5678_Sentinel-2.html),
    and then arrive at the final plot.
