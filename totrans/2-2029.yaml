    for various types of problems. Competitors compete by building Machine Learning
    models and submitting their predictions. The competitor with the most accurate
    predictions takes home a prize.'

    of learning. The platform itself encourages public sharing of approaches during
    and after the competitions.

    techniques used in Kaggle competitions. But it won’t review the exact solutions
    for the specific problem setting. Instead, we will analyze the Kaggle competition’s
    winning solutions and extract the “blueprints” for lessons we can apply to our
    data science projects.
