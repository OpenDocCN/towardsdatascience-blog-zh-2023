    with causation and try to find an explanation for everything happening around
    us. If a car behind us takes the same turns we do for a long time, we assume it's
    following us, which is a causal assumption. However, when we snap out of the movie
    mood, we then think we are properly just heading to the same destination — — a
    confounder. A common cause introduces a correlation between the two cars' movements.
    This vivid and relatable example that Pearl gives proves how the human brain works.

    that discussed different causal structures, it points out that conditioning the
    colliders (hospitalized) generates an explain-away effect that makes two uncorrelated
    variables spuriously correlated. In other words, the hospitalized population is
    not an accurate representation of the general population, and any observations
    made from this sample cannot be generalized.

    outcomes of switching or not switching, given the participant has chosen door
    1\. For first row shows that the car is in door 1, and the host can open either
    door 2 or door 3 to reveal the goat. If the participant switches, they will lose.
    In row 2, the host has to reveal door 3 for the goat, and similarly, the host
    can only open door 2 for the goat. Since the participants are equally likely to
    choose any door as the initial selection, comparing the columns of “Switch” and
    “Not Switch,” we can see switch door has a higher probability of winning at 2/3
    compared to not switching at 1/3\. Thus, switching doors is a preferred strategy.

    The fact that the host opened door 3 instead of door 2 makes door 2 more likely
    to have a car behind. Conditioning on the collider, in this case, given that the
    host opened door 3, the participants’ first choice, door 1, is less likely to

    causal diagram is true and in the data, we observe smokers are **nine times**
    more likely to develop lung cancer, it must be because they are **nine times**
    more likely to have the smoking gene than non-smokers.

    to have it. However, the percentage becomes mathematically impossible if we observe
    that 12% of non-smokers have the smoking gene.

    smoking and lung cancer. Thus, the right causal diagram provides a more accurate
    explanation.

    sheds light on drawing inferences by evaluating how strong alternative relationships
    must be in the absence of causality to explain the observed data.

    how mothers who smoke affect their babies' survival rates, challenging the argument
    that smoke causes mortality. The findings show that babies of smoking mothers
    indeed weigh less. However, the low-birth-weight babies of smoking mothers had
    a better survival rate than those of non-smokers.

    reduces child mortality rate. However, if we think further about what are the
    factors that contribute to babies’ birth weights other than smoking, we will find
    the collider bias here.

    Smoking has no correlation with birth defects unless we control birth weight.
    If we only look at low-birth-weight babies, we are opening up the backdoor path
    of smoking to mortality. The relationship will be biased by the birth defects
    to mortality causal path.

    weight. For example, studies have found ***race*** is another factor that affects
    both birth weight and child mortality.

    that among all the people they date, the attractive ones tend to be jerks? Instead
    of utilizing psychosocial theories involving traumas and personality disorders,
    Pearl shows that **collider bias** can be the answer. Your friends’ choices of
    people to date depend on two factors: attractiveness and personality. In this
    case, you will date a mean, attractive person, a nice, unattractive person, and
    certainly a nice, attractive person. However, you will never date a mean, unattractive
    person. As illustrated by the following causal diagram:'

    as mean as attractive people in the whole population (Attractiveness and Personality
    are not correlated), your friends never realize it because the dating pool never

    using causal diagrams. Paradoxes are data we observe that trick and confuse us.
    However, by digging into the data generation process and drawing the causal diagrams,
    we can provide explanations of these paradoxes, which not only clears the confusion
    but also gives us trustworthy guidance into decision-making.
