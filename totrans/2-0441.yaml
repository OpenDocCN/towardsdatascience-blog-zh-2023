    and implementation of the AI strategy at an established bank. Although relatively
    green in delivering at such scale, I accepted the job with enthusiasm. Dispelling
    the initial feelings of imposter syndrome, I reassured myself that the worst-case

    than I had initially perceived. Throughout my career, I have had the good fortune
