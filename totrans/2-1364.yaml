    aren’t actually *Data* Scientists?

    Google, but for the last 5 years has been working as Google’s Chief *Decision*
    Scientist. Or take Chris Dowsett, who began his career as a Statistician and worked

    the aforementioned Chief Decision Scientist at Google, Decision Science is the
    discipline of turning information into actions.

    of decision-making. It combines Data Science (statistics, machine learning, AI,
    analytics) with the Behavioral Sciences (psychology, neuroscience, economics,
    and the managerial sciences).

    Science, you’re not alone. That was my first reaction, too.

- en: 'But the key to Cassie’s definition is that fashionable little word: “interdisciplinary.”
    If Data Science is primarily a *quantitative* discipline based on applied statistics
    and ML, we can think of Decision Science as a discipline which includes both quantitative
    *and* qualitative methods. Its primary focus is on making decisions, and this
    makes it much more holistic than traditional Data Science (which often gets too
    preoccupied with simply answering questions with statistics or improving products
    with ML).'

    as Data Science. But as a Data Scientist, I’m convinced that the rise of Decision
    Science is going to have a profound impact on the Data industry, and those of
    us working in Data Science would be wise to take note.

- en: A Data Scientist used to be a jack-of-all-trades, doing everything from business
    analysis to ML engineering. We were the go-to people for solving business problems
    with data, equally comfortable in the boardroom and the engine room (at least
    in theory).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in 2023, that’s not really the full picture anymore. In many large corporates,
    Data Scientists don’t present to execs anymore; they’ve got Analytics Translators
    to do that. They don’t build pipelines or productionise models; they’ve got Machine
    Learning Engineers and Data Ops teams who do that. And in some companies, Data
    Scientists don’t even build ML models; they’ve got Machine Learning Scientists
    who do that.

    and specialised. And, interestingly, the Data Science job description of 10 years
    ago (≈ “uses ML, stats, and critical thinking to solve business problems”) almost
    seems to apply more aptly to a modern-day Decision Scientist than to a modern-day
    Data Scientist (at least, in large companies).

    value of qualitative approaches**'

    of interdisciplinary approaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All too often, contemporary Data Science can feel more like Applied Math, narrowly
    obsessing over algorithms and technical details rather than keeping in mind the
    bigger picture. We build fantastic models, but fail to move the needle in corporate
    contexts because we’re not addressing the right question or aren’t managing to
    land our message with the right decision-makers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decision Science corrects this bias by reminding us that data are just tools
    for answering questions and solving problems, and that — to reach the optimal
    decisions — we need to draw on lots of fields including behavioural science and
    psychology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might never get (or want) the job title “Decision Scientist,” but interdisciplinary
    approaches are valuable to all of us working in Data. If you’re interested in
    incorporating non-Math approaches, check out Cassie’s excellent [article](/introduction-to-decision-intelligence-5d147ddab767),
    where she introduces questions from Behavioural Economics like *“How does changing
    the presentation of information influence choice behavior?”* and questions from
    Psychology like *“How do emotions, heuristics, and biases play into decision-making?”*

    Data professionals
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I was getting into Data in 2019, I read countless Reddit posts complaining
    about the state of Data Science. Back then, Data Scientists didn’t have a clear
    career path, and the jack-of-all-trades label meant that many Data Scientists
    were getting bogged down in tasks like Data Engineering or Visualisation, which
    weren’t really viewed as part of the core Data Science “canon.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rise of specialisms like Decision Science is a welcome antidote to this
    confusion. By distinguishing between Data Science and Decision Science, companies
    are better able to delineate between the responsibilities of different data folk,
    and Data professionals have more options in terms of where they want to specialise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t get me wrong — there’ll always be a need for generalists in Data Science,
    so the generalist Data Science roles won’t disappear. But in big organisations,
    we might see more Decision Scientists, and on a personal level, I think this is
    an excellent thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Because if you’re more interested in the math/engineering side of things,
    then you have the option to focus more on MLOps or Data Engineering. Or, if your
    primary interests are in problem-solving, then Decision Science might be a better
    fit for you, and you won’t have to get as bogged down in ML Engineering or Data
    Governance.
