- en: If you closely look at the chunks that the database retrieves, you will sometimes
    notice that they’re not exactly relevant to the problem. They’re certainly similar
    to the question to some extent but in many cases, they’re not fully aligned with
    what the user asks for. Moreover, these chunks can often be redundant and overlapping
    which makes the generated answer … repetitive.
