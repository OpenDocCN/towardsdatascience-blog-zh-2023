    showcasing the beauty and [bias](http://bit.ly/quaesita_aibiasm) of AI art. My
    inspiration was wondering how AI systems reflect national identity, so I used
    the same prompt with different country names to generate some art and the results
    are fascinating!

    is an [AI art generator](http://bit.ly/quaesita_drugs) that takes text prompts
    as input and generates four images per prompt as output. In order to use it, you
    need a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account connected to the [Midjourney bot](https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F).
    While this was annoying and took me 10 minutes to [set up](https://docs.midjourney.com/),
    I think it’s worth the effort.

    directly into a [Midjourney newbies channel](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/)

    you’ll keep your eyes glued to the screen while your creations flash by and are
    lost in a chaotic jumble of results from everyone else who’s on the channel with
    you. Any art you make is also posted publicly on their website under your username

    you start, else you might waste your 25 opportunities.

    on them is simply reflecting our species back at us. The best and the worst of
    us. The images we choose to capture in the first place reveal what we believed
    was important at the time. Unfortunately, our values have always been rife with
    [bias](http://bit.ly/quaesita_biasdef). (I have a whole article about bias and

    Some are terrible. But perhaps we can learn something about ourselves by examining
    them and do better in the future. I’ll let you judge for yourselves.

    I planned to submit each prompt once only, then allow myself 3 rerolls of the
    worst results… but I’d have to tell you which countries were rerolled.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason each result you’re seeing — except the 3 rerolls — is the first one,
    is that if I reran every prompt multiple times and picked my favorite, the results
    would tell you more about me than about Midjourney or the underlying training
    data. (I’m adamant that when a person tinkers with the prompts and obtains art
    by choosing their favorite from multiple prompts, the artist is [definitely the
    human](http://bit.ly/quaesita_drugs) and *not* an AI.) The outputs would reflect
    me, my tastes, and my view of the world. But that’s not what this collection is
    about. My participation as artist ends with the concept. Except the 3 rerolls,
    there was no cherry-picking of individual pieces.

    I prefer to call it, text tinkering.) Before I started the project, I tinkered
    with the phrasing to get the graphic style I liked best. Don’t snort into your
    milkshake, but for a minute there I was seriously considering using “Cartoon from
    the 1980s about science and progress, set in [country].”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why science and progress, not just progress? Science seemed like a fun addition
    to the prompt, not only because images about science often focus on the best in
    humanity, but also because I’m a scientist by training (let’s check that personal
    bias!) and because it gives the AI generator plenty of opportunity to tap into
    some delightful weirdness as it invents new science for the future. (I’m also
    a weirdo — double bias!)

    a current or former member of the United Nations or a UN special committee got
    a spot in the exhibition, and I entered them in alphabetical order from this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states)
    using their common name. The only quick editorial changes I made were prompting
    “Georgia (Europe)” instead of just “Georgia” and “Republic of Chad” instead of
    just “Chad”, since Midjourney doesn’t learn from patterns the way a person would.
    If you were my illustrator and I gave you all those prompts, you’d realize that
    I intend for you to treat Chad as a country since all the others are, but I had
    a hunch that Midjourney would interpret Chad to mean some guy named Charles on
    a casual day. As for the rest, I just threw in whatever was in the first column
    of the list.

    were incorrect flags, the wrong numbers of fingers plus the occasional extra limb,
    weird “science” that isn’t science, costumes from elsewhere on the same continent,
    gibberish lettering, and a strong bias towards whatever is most frequently depicted
    on each nation’s tourism brochures. None of these would surprise me and they shouldn’t
    surprise you either. If you expect the “I” in AI to stand for intelligence, then
    you’ll be constantly alarmed and dismayed at the kinds of dumb mistakes these
    systems make. So, to avoid disappointment, I suggest thinking of AI as standing
    for “[automated inspiration](http://bit.ly/quaesita_history2)” instead.

    Midjourney saw fit to depict scientists as animals in labcoats. A future where
    we’re all animals is a bit too much progress for my tastes. It’s hard to say whether
    the reason for the initial image was statistical randomness, too many wildlife
    brochures, unfair caricatures, or something else entirely.

- en: While I’m not privy to the details of Midjourney’s [training set](http://bit.ly/quaesita_mrbean),
    it’s reasonable to assume that the sources of the images fueling Midjourney are
    highly correlated with the global distribution of internet-enabled devices, so
    the images you’ll get are less likely to reflect how a nation sees itself and
    more likely to be partial caricatures of how people from nations with widespread
    internet usage see others.

- en: Whose views does Midjourney reflect? It’ll be highly correlated with the global
    distribution of internet-enabled devices, so not all nations will have contributed
    equally to the training data.

    showed too many buildings in ruin… and that wasn’t what my prompt asked for, was
    it? I asked for “science and ***progress,*** taking place in the ***future***.”
    Whatever the past of a nation, there’s no reason its future can’t be glorious
    — images of a brighter tomorrow was my intention with the form of the prompt in
    the first place. A reroll improved them somewhat. But even though the exhibition
    excludes those original images, there’s still a teachable moment here: AI reflects
    our past back at us and if we use it to make automatic final-say decisions without
    a human in the loop, it’ll keep us mired in our past and make it harder for us
    to change for the better.'
