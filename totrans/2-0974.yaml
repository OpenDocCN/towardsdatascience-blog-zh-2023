- en: Supply chain optimization is a vast area of research. There is a plethora of
    use cases within supply chains that would benefit from the application of AI/ML
    technology. Oftentimes, organizations struggle with where and how to start in
    this space. Supply chain executives are typically looking for areas where to invest
    the time and effort of their teams (which are already stretched) to derive the
    most value from these approaches. In this article, we explore a small but diverse
    set of use cases that can serve as a starting point for a supply chain organization’s
    foray into AI/ML. Supply chain leaders can expect to gain a high degree of cost
    and efficiency improvements from these applications.

    → 采购 → 制造 → 交付 → 逆向物流。'
- en: '1\. Short-term demand sensing (Plan): Inventory management is a critical supply
    chain activity. Working capital and storage costs are tied to inventory levels,
    which in turn, are dependent on accurately forecasting demand among other factors.
    A high level of forecast accuracy helps to reduce inventory costs and stock outs
    by driving the manufacture of the right quantity of product at the right location
    at the right time. This helps optimize inventory in warehouses reducing safety
    stock levels, thereby reducing costs, while avoiding stock outs that may lead
    to long-term business and revenue losses. An AI enabled application can identify
    patterns in customer orders and correlate certain leading indicators to the short-term
    demand to be more accurate than from traditional methods. With real-time orders
    information, we can automate demand predictions for the current and next month
    that are refreshed regularly.'

  zh: 1\. 短期需求感知（计划）：库存管理是供应链中至关重要的活动。营运资本和存储成本与库存水平相关，而库存水平又依赖于准确预测需求等因素。高水平的预测准确性有助于通过在正确的地点和时间生产合适数量的产品来减少库存成本和缺货情况。这有助于优化仓库中的库存，降低安全库存水平，从而减少成本，同时避免可能导致长期业务和收入损失的缺货现象。一个启用了AI的应用可以识别客户订单中的模式，并将某些领先指标与短期需求相关联，从而比传统方法更准确。通过实时订单信息，我们可以自动化当前和下一个月的需求预测，并定期更新。
- en: '2\. Supplier segmentation (Source): Large organizations may have hundreds or
    thousands of suppliers that form an integral part of their supply chain. Different
    raw materials in varying quantities are sourced from suppliers. To reduce cost
    of procurement while increasing reliability of supply, it would be helpful to
    apply different strategies to different suppliers. Clustering suppliers into a
    few key groups would be beneficial in this regard given large number of suppliers.
    This type of segmentation will enable targeted contract negotiations on raw material
    prices, volumes and supply timing to optimize spend. An AI enabled application
    can segment suppliers based on features such as volume, price, strategic relationship,
    reliability to enable sourcing specialists to adopt similar procurement strategies
    for suppliers within a cluster. This segmentation can be refreshed on a monthly
    or quarterly basis to account for supplier changes.'

  zh: 2\. 供应商细分（采购）：大型组织可能有数百或数千个供应商，这些供应商是其供应链的重要组成部分。不同的原材料以不同的数量从供应商处采购。为了在增加供应可靠性的同时降低采购成本，应用不同的策略于不同的供应商将会非常有帮助。考虑到供应商数量众多，将供应商分为几个关键组将会很有益。这种细分可以实现对原材料价格、数量和供应时间的有针对性的合同谈判，从而优化支出。一个启用了AI的应用可以基于特征如数量、价格、战略关系和可靠性来细分供应商，使采购专家能够对一个集群内的供应商采用类似的采购策略。此细分可以每月或每季度更新，以适应供应商的变化。
- en: '3\. Equipment failure predictions (Make): Unplanned downtimes due to reliability
    failures are common in manufacturing operations. These tend to stress product
    inventory positions and can lead to delays in customer fulfilment. Predicting
    when such downtimes may occur can help a facility either take actions to mitigate
    the risk of equipment failure or prepare in advance by building up inventory to
    account for the downtime. These predictions and consequent mitigation actions
    can help avoid stock outs and lost revenues and as well as drive investment in
    preventative maintenance options to avoid costly repairs. An AI enabled application
    can correlate equipment failures to key measurements (such as throughput, pressure,
    temperature etc.) for days or weeks leading up to an unplanned equipment failure
    and provide insights on the timing of failures. Depending on the granularity of
    measurements, the application may be run every day or every few days to assess
    the risk of failures.'

  zh: 3. 设备故障预测（制造）：由于可靠性故障导致的计划外停机在制造操作中很常见。这往往会影响产品库存位置，并可能导致客户履约延迟。预测这些停机可能发生的时间可以帮助工厂采取措施减少设备故障风险，或提前准备库存以应对停机。这些预测和相应的缓解措施可以帮助避免缺货和收入损失，同时推动对预防性维护选项的投资，以避免昂贵的维修。启用人工智能的应用可以将设备故障与关键测量（如产量、压力、温度等）相关联，提供故障发生时间的见解。根据测量的粒度，该应用可能每天或每几天运行一次，以评估故障风险。
- en: '4\. Delivery time prediction (Delivery): On-time delivery to customers is a
    key metric to gauge performance of supply chains that directly impacts customer
    experience. Organizations measure this metric and actively attempt to improve
    it based on historical delay trends. Being able to predict delivery times accurately
    can help get the product to the customer at the requested time, thereby avoiding
    poor customer experience and lost business consequently and avoid penalties and
    other charges due to late deliveries. An AI enabled application can be used to
    predict delivery times based on start day and time, season, carrier, source, and
    destination among other attributes. Such a prediction for each shipment will enable
    keeping the customer informed and enhance customer experience and retention. Furthermore,
    this presents an opportunity to optimize the routes and select the better performing
    carriers.'

  zh: 4. 交货时间预测（交付）：准时交付给客户是衡量供应链表现的关键指标，这直接影响客户体验。组织会测量这一指标，并根据历史延迟趋势积极尝试改进。能够准确预测交货时间可以帮助在要求的时间内将产品送到客户手中，从而避免糟糕的客户体验和由此带来的商业损失，并避免因迟交而产生的罚款和其他费用。启用人工智能的应用可以基于开始日期和时间、季节、承运人、来源和目的地等属性预测交货时间。这样的预测可以使每次发货时保持客户知情，提升客户体验和客户留存。此外，这还提供了优化路线和选择表现更佳的承运人的机会。
- en: '5\. Customer returns forecast (Reverse Logistics): A percentage of sales is
    returned by customers for a variety of reasons including not meeting quality specifications
    or delays in shipping. To prepare for returns shipments, storage and processing,
    companies need to have an accurate estimate of volume of products coming back.
    This will help in reducing storage and processing costs. An AI enabled application
    can provide an aggregate volume of returns as a function of past several weeks
    of customer shipments. This prediction can be updated on a weekly basis.'

  zh: 5. 客户退货预测（逆向物流）：由于未达到质量规格或运输延迟等原因，客户会退回一定比例的销售产品。为了准备退货运输、储存和处理，公司需要准确估算退回产品的数量。这有助于减少储存和处理成本。启用人工智能的应用可以根据过去几周的客户发货量提供退货的总体量。此预测可以每周更新一次。

    tractability, results explainability, insights actionability, and application
    sustainability. Economic value includes any cost savings or loss of revenue avoidance.
    Tractability refers to availability of data and a robust AI/ML approach to provide
    predictions in a reasonable amount of time. Results explainability indicates how
    readily the observations and predictions can be explained to stakeholders using
    business drivers. Insights actionability characterizes the extent to which the
    organization can act on the results of the AI/ML application. Finally, application
    sustainability describes the long-term viability of actively maintaining and refreshing

    hence the explainability has been marked as ‘High’. Application of more complex
    ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest, Xgboost) for *Equipment Failures Prediction*

  zh: 结论
- en: The application of AI/ML techniques for supply chain and business optimization
    is still a nascent area in many industries. It is not unreasonable to take a “crawl,
    walk, run” approach towards integration of AI/ML into operations. Demonstrating
    the efficacy of AI/ML in generating value for a team via “low-hanging fruit” can
    have a flywheel effect. It is critical, though, to build on smaller successes
    towards a sustainable longer-term business model, where AI/ML is embedded in every
    aspect of the value chain.

    AI/ML 为团队创造价值的有效性，可以产生飞轮效应。然而，重要的是在较小的成功基础上构建可持续的长期商业模式，使 AI/ML 融入价值链的每个方面。
