    around, especially when you’re talking about chemicals. Imagine you have a couple
    of different paints on a piece of paper, and they start to mix and create new
    colors — that’s like the “reaction” part. The paint blots don’t just stay in one
    spot; they spread out and blend — that spreading is like the “diffusion” part.

    (GIS). The technique of segmentation, in this respect, can aid in delineating
    shorelines from aerial or satellite data, allowing for precise coastal mapping.

    which acts like a compact camera, zooming in on the most essential parts of an
    image and breaking it into smaller parts — so it’s easier to work with. The second
    part is the “decoder,” it works like an artist who takes that compacted version
    and redraws the whole picture with all the details.

    some details (obviously!). But the UNET has a clever trick: it uses “skip connections,”
    shortcuts that allow it to remember and bring back the details that might have

    the final picture is as detailed as the original.'

    a cake, which we call “latent space.” This recipe includes all the ingredients
    and steps needed to bake the cake a certain way. In stable diffusion, you can
    change this recipe to alter the final cake. Want to turn a vanilla cake into a
    chocolate one? You adjust the recipe — this is like tweaking the “latent space.”
    You’re not starting from scratch; you’re making minor changes to the ingredients
    (or image characteristics) to end up with a different but related result (And
    this can help us guess the hints for custom training). If the basic recipe is
    the sketch, the added flavors, and decorations are the colors and textures in
    a painting.

- en: Think of driving in a car during a heavy rainstorm. At first, the rain is pelting
    down your windshield, making it hard to see where you’re going. But your windshield
    wipers swipe away the water, giving you brief moments of clarity. Training a UNET
    with noise is like improving the quality of your windshield wipers. Initially,
    they might be flawed, and your vision is still blurry with each swipe. But as
    you “train” your wipers — adjusting their speed and ensuring they contact the
    glass correctly — they get better at clearing the rain from your view. In the
    same way, the U-Net starts by trying to see through the “rain” of noise on images.
    Over time, it gets better at swiping away the noise until it can consistently
    provide a clear “view” of the underlying image, just as effective wipers eventually
    give you a clear view of the road ahead — potentially not the best analogy, but
    you get the point…
