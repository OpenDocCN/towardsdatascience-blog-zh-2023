    continue, AI chatbots have emerged as a promising tool to enhance the music search
    experience. With their ability to engage in conversational interactions and provide
    tailored recommendations, chatbots are poised to revolutionize the way we explore
    and enjoy music. In this blog post, I will present **three compelling reasons**
    why chatbots are about to take over music search.

- en: The recent advancements in artificial intelligence have propelled chatbot technology
    to new heights, enabling them to understand and respond to human queries with
    increased intelligence and nuance. Recognizing the advantages of conversational
    search over traditional methods, industry giants such as Microsoft and Google
    have started implementing AI chatbots into their web search engines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the realm of music search, this shift holds particular relevance as simple
    keyword-based searches, akin to “Googling,” have only gained prominence in the
    past few months. Some music tech startups like [Cyanite](https://cyanite.ai/2023/02/01/pr-cyanite-launches-technology-that-can-find-music-based-on-full-text-for-the-first-time/)
    have launched free-text music search features as a breakthrough technology earlier
    this year. Prior to that, music search primarily relied on selecting genres, moods,
    or artists and sifting through potentially numerous songs to find the desired
    one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the emergence of models like ChatGPT has facilitated a transition from
    “free-text” search to truly conversational search. This transformative approach
    allows us to overcome the repetitive “input-output-repeat” workflow and replace
    it with dynamic and natural conversations. This paradigm shift aligns with the
    ongoing evolution witnessed in major search engines like Microsoft’s Bing and
    Google.
  prefs: []

    levels. In fact, I built my own [music chatbot prototype](https://github.com/MaxHilsdorf/music_search_chatbot)
    within less than a day and at less than $5 — but more on that in a follow-up post.
    While ChatGPT itself already proves quite useful for music discovery, tailored
    chatbot systems offer even more refined responses, seamless integrations with
    music databases or web players, and greater control over the conversation. Thanks
    to recent developments in the open-source community, building custom chatbots
    trained on domain- or company-specific data and customized to individual needs
    has become easier than ever before.

- en: When it comes to music discovery, conversations provide a natural and intuitive
    way to explore and find new songs or artists. We often rely on recommendations
    from friends, music enthusiasts, or experts because these conversations allow
    us to express our preferences and receive personalized suggestions. Chatbots can
    replicate this conversational experience, enabling users to engage in a dialogue
    about their musical tastes and receive tailored recommendations.

    all previous results, even if they could be useful for subsequent stages of the
    search process. This limitation is where chatbots excel, as they have the capability
    to store the entire search history, i.e. conversation.

    search and presents you with another 20 songs. This procedure continues until
    you have found something you like.

    love.
  prefs:

    it knows that the results could otherwise be imprecise. You tell the chatbot “dunno,
    maybe 110–130 bpm?” without altering your original prompt. Taking into account
    all the information gathered from the conversation, the chatbot initiates a search
    and presents you with a new list of 20 tracks ranked by predicted relevance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, upon reviewing the top 5 tracks, you find that they are once again
    live recordings, which you had not specified as a preference. Fortunately, instead
    of going back to the prompting stage and starting the search process anew, you
    can leverage the chatbot’s capabilities to refine the results. You simply ask
    the chatbot to exclude all live recordings from the recommendations. Understanding
    your request, the chatbot filters the existing 20 tracks into two categories:
    studio recordings and live recordings. It then presents you with the filtered
    results, eliminating the need for another costly search.'

- en: One of the most exciting prospects of music chatbots is their potential to act
    as domain-specific experts, akin to pocket musicologists. Musicologists are individuals
    with extensive knowledge about various genres, artists, historical context, and
    other intricate details of music. By encapsulating this expertise within a chatbot,
    users can access a wealth of information and insights instantaneously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To illustrate this, let us consider a scenario where you are searching for a
    song that embodies a specific musical attribute, but you can only describe it
    through a reference such as “a guitar solo in the style of AC/DC.” While a competent
    music search engine can search for songs with guitar solos, it may struggle to
    understand the reference, especially if it doesn’t have any songs by AC/DC in
    its database. In such cases, your only alternative is to attempt to articulate
    what makes an AC/DC solo sound unique, which can be challenging for someone without
    extensive musical knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where the pocket musicologist chatbot becomes invaluable. A music chatbot
    trained on a variety of sources such as album reviews, fan forums, sheet music,
    and published scientific music analyses possesses a deep understanding of how
    a typical AC/DC guitar solo is structured and performed. Therefore, the chatbot
    can take your reference and formulate a precise prompt that describes the desired
    musical characteristics in a way that can be effectively utilized by the search
    engine.

    general-purpose chatbot with no specific musicological training. You can imagine
    that such a domain-specific chatbot would be able to come up with more accurate
    and precise descriptions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is only one example of how conceptualizing music chatbots as pocket musicologists
    can help improve the search experience. However, the possibilities are endless.
    For example, you could start the conversation by asking the chatbot to list some
    interesting jazz subgenres and explain the key characteristics of each. Then,
    you can choose a genre that sounds interesting and initiate a search within that
    genre. Consider this: When ChatGPT was released in late 2022, no one could have
    predicted the wide range of uses it would have for its millions of users. The
    same will apply to chatbot-based music search.'

- en: In the previous sections, I have presented three arguments for why we may be
    on the brink of a paradigm shift in music search. While there may be dissenting
    opinions regarding the validity of these arguments, the crucial question at hand
    is whether the advantages and feasibility of chatbot-based music search can persuade
    companies and research institutions to pursue the development of this technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is by no means obvious that chatbots will completely replace traditional
    search engines. Fortunately, we can examine the developments in other search domains,
    particularly web search. Despite the availability of web-search chatbots such
    as the new Bing or Google search and Perplexity AI, their usage remains primarily
    limited to technology enthusiasts and AI professionals. Clearly, these chatbots
    have not gained widespread adoption comparable to the general-purpose (and offline!)
    chatbot, ChatGPT. Most notably, they are far from replacing the conventional Google
    search engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this may be partly due to the time it takes for the products to mature
    and their potential users to adopt them, there are also practical considerations
    that favor the continued use of more traditional keyword-based or semantic searches.
    For instance, search engines are frequently employed to locate specific articles,
    websites, or songs that we have previously encountered but don’t recall the complete
    name or web address. In such situations, employing a keyword-based search and
    matching the search input to results that closely align with the entered keywords
    is much more practical. Utilizing a sophisticated technology like a chatbot for
    this purpose would be like cracking nuts with a sledgehammer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, not every interaction needs to be a conversation. When searching
    for songs within a particular genre, for example, you might prefer not to engage
    in a dialogue with an AI bot. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, you might
    want instant results, making any response from the search engine that deviates
    from providing search results a waste of time. Secondly, employing a chatbot can
    transform the purely mechanical act of conducting a music search into a social
    interaction. This potential social aspect could be seen as a drawback, particularly
    for individuals who seek solace in music as a means to escape their social environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, I anticipate that this paradigm shift will not completely eliminate
    traditional approaches to music search. Instead, I envision chatbots being utilized
    in scenarios where users seek guidance and consultation rather than a quick filtering
    of a music catalog. In the realm of production music, a chatbot-based search can
    greatly assist in finding the perfect track for a commercial or a YouTube video.
    However, for the average user of music streaming services, resorting to more traditional
    search systems may be more practical in most cases. Ultimately, the paradigm shift
    could manifest in production music libraries and music streaming services incorporating
    both types of searches to accommodate the diverse needs of their users.

- en: In today’s tech landscape, building customized chatbots that align with your
    specific business requirements has become remarkably accessible. There are several
    approaches to achieving this. One method involves utilizing foundational models
    such as OpenAI’s GPT models via their API and augmenting them with custom logic.
    Another approach involves leveraging open-source language models and fine-tuning
    them using domain-specific data to ensure relevance and accuracy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using pre-built foundational models like GPT-4 via an API offers numerous advantages.
    Firstly, it enables businesses to begin utilizing the models directly without
    the need for additional data acquisition, preparation, or machine learning efforts
    on their part. This is particularly advantageous for companies with limited or
    no in-house data scientists, as it simplifies the task into a software engineering
    problem. Secondly, there is no need to concern yourself with constructing on-premise
    or cloud infrastructure to accommodate the computational requirements of these
    large models. By leveraging the API, businesses can access a managed solution
    at a relatively low cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One downside is that your data, including user search inputs, music metadata,
    etc., could potentially be accessed by the model provider (e.g., OpenAI) or even
    used to further train their models. This may not comply with internal data governance
    guidelines or external regulations, depending on your situation. Another drawback
    is that these third-party solutions often do not permit fine-tuning their models
    on your data. As a result, it becomes impossible to develop the type of “pocket
    musicologist” described earlier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, using open-source models on your own infrastructure presents
    several advantages. Firstly, there are no limitations in constructing a chatbot
    that is entirely customized to meet your specific requirements. Through the process
    of fine-tuning, you can transform it into a comprehensive music expert or train
    it to understand the specific vocabulary used within your company or domain. Secondly,
    each step of the workflow, including fine-tuning and model inference, can be implemented
    within your own infrastructure. This eliminates any concerns regarding compliance
    with internal guidelines or external regulations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The drawback of building your own chatbot using open-source models is that it
    produces a significant engineering overhead. This consumes both computational
    and human resources, which you may be hesitant to invest in a product before witnessing
    initial results. Furthermore, open-source models become outdated at an accelerated
    pace. Consequently, you would need to transition to newer models and repeat the
    fine-tuning process regularly, leading to the consumption of additional resources.
    In contrast, a managed solution through an API provides greater flexibility to
    experiment with and switch to alternative chatbot models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In conclusion, if you aim to develop a quick prototype or lack the necessary
    human resources to fine-tune and deploy your own models within a suitable infrastructure,
    I suggest opting for a managed API solution at present. This is precisely what
    I did for my [chatbot prototype](https://github.com/MaxHilsdorf/music_search_chatbot),
    and you are welcome to draw inspiration from my approach. However, it is important
    to note that these solutions are likely to be outcompeted by more advanced and
    tailored systems, such as those based on open-source models.
