- en: The frequentist approach to statistics is based on the idea of repeated sampling
    and long-run relative frequency. It involves constructing hypotheses about a population
    and testing them using sample data. On the other hand, the Bayesian approach is
    based on subjective probability and involves updating an initial belief about
    a population using collected data. Both methods have their strengths and limitations
    and which one to use depends on the problem and analysis goals. In this article,
    we will explore the differences between the frequentist and the Bayesian approach
    and discuss how they can be implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability.

  zh: 频率学与贝叶斯方法的比较
- en: Frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics are two main approaches to statistical
    inference, which is the process of using data to draw conclusions about a population.
    Both approaches are used to estimate unknown quantities, make predictions, and
    test hypotheses, but they differ in their interpretation of probability and how
    they incorporate prior knowledge and evidence.

  zh: 频率学统计和贝叶斯统计是统计推断的两种主要方法，统计推断是利用数据对总体得出结论的过程。这两种方法都用于估计未知量、进行预测和检验假设，但在概率的解释及如何融入先验知识和证据方面有所不同。
- en: In frequentist statistics, probability is interpreted as the long-run relative
    frequency of an event in an infinite number of trials. This approach is based
    on the idea that the true value of a population parameter is fixed, but is unknown
    and must be estimated from data. In this framework, statistical inferences are
    drawn from the observed data by making assumptions about the underlying data-generating
    process and using techniques such as point estimation, confidence intervals, and
    hypothesis testing.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在频率学统计中，概率被解释为事件在无限次试验中的长期相对频率。这种方法基于一个观点，即总体参数的真实值是固定的，但未知且必须通过数据进行估计。在这个框架下，统计推断是通过对观察数据进行假设来从中得出的，使用点估计、置信区间和假设检验等技术。
- en: On the other hand, Bayesian statistics interprets probability as a measure of
    belief or degree of certainty about an event. This approach allows for the incorporation
    of prior knowledge and evidence into statistical analysis through the use of Bayes’
    theorem. In this framework, the true value of a population parameter is treated
    as a random variable and is updated as new data is collected. This results in
    a full distribution over the parameter space, known as a posterior distribution,
    which can be used to make probabilistic predictions and to quantify uncertainty.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一方面，贝叶斯统计将概率解释为对事件的信念或确定性的程度。这种方法允许通过使用贝叶斯定理将先验知识和证据融入统计分析。在这个框架下，总体参数的真实值被视为随机变量，并随着新数据的收集而更新。这导致了一个关于参数空间的完整分布，称为后验分布，这可以用来进行概率预测并量化不确定性。
- en: One key difference between the two approaches is how they handle uncertainty.
    In frequentist statistics, uncertainty is quantified through the use of confidence
    intervals, which provide an estimate of the likely range of the true population
    parameter based on the observed data. In Bayesian statistics, uncertainty is represented
    by the full posterior distribution, which allows for a more complete characterization
    of the uncertainty surrounding the true value of the parameter.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 两种方法之间的一个关键区别是它们处理不确定性的方式。在频率学统计中，不确定性通过使用置信区间来量化，这些区间提供了基于观察数据的真实总体参数的可能范围的估计。在贝叶斯统计中，不确定性通过完整的后验分布来表示，这使得对参数真实值的不确定性进行更全面的描述成为可能。
- en: Another difference is that Bayesian statistics allows for the incorporation
    of prior knowledge, which can be particularly useful in cases where there is limited
    data or when the data-generating process is complex. However, the choice of prior
    distribution can significantly influence the results of a Bayesian analysis, and
    it is important to choose a prior that is appropriate for the problem at hand.

    the uncertainty surrounding the estimate. To quantify this uncertainty, we can
    use a confidence interval. A confidence interval is an estimate of the likely
    range of the true population parameter based on the observed data, and it is constructed
    by adding and subtracting a margin of error from the point estimate. The margin
    of error is determined by the desired level of confidence and the sample size,
    and it reflects the variability in the sample data. For example, a 95% confidence
    interval indicates that we are 95% confident that the true population parameter
    falls within the interval.

    distribution over the population mean income, *𝑃*(*𝜃*). This prior distribution
    represents our belief about the value of the population mean income before we
    observe the data. The choice of prior distribution will depend on any available
    prior knowledge and the characteristics of the data-generating process. For example,
    if we have strong prior knowledge that the population mean income is normally
    distributed with a mean of 45,000 and a standard deviation of 5,000, we could
    use a normal prior distribution with these parameters.

    distributions. For us to accomplish that, we need to introduce one more concept
