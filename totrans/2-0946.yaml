    why don‚Äôt you try that?‚Äù*. Encouragements like this are well-meant, but not very
    useful. Most people understand the value of networking. Many data scientists are
    **not hired through official job listings but through referrals and connections.**
  prefs: []

    some is not relevant for data scientists, and some is outright wrong. It‚Äôs easier
    to look back at the previous step in your career and understand what actually
    worked. This is because you can see the common denominator between successful
    people around you ‚ú®

- en: In this blog post, I want to give you my tips for how to network as a data scientist.
    Below I‚Äôve divided this into tips for **aspiring data scientists**, **junior data
    scientists**, and **senior data scientists**. I‚Äôm a senior data scientist myself,
    so I have experience with all of these steps. I‚Äôve also talked with many professional
    recruiters and been on both sides of hiring interviews for data scientists. Still,
    **please take everything I say with a grain of salt**. I‚Äôm no more an authority
    on this topic than anyone else, and these are just my own reflections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we start, you should know that I think approaching networking as an optimization
    problem is **fundamentally flawed**. Having 1000 LinkedIn connections or 5.000
    likes on your post about LLMs is not the goal. The goal of networking is to establish
    genuine connections with other like-minded people that love the same things you
    do. These connections give you a network of people that you can both help and
    reach out to when needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Paradoxically, approaching networking as an optimization problem makes you bad
    at networking. This makes you focus on metrics rather than people. Meeting someone
    that only converses with you for the ‚Äúclout‚Äù is off-putting. This approach is
    also phycological damaging. You begin to see people as mere means to achieving
    some arbitrary metric. This is neither particularly fun nor effective üòî
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So while reading the tips below, don‚Äôt forget that networking is fundamentally
    about people. This, I‚Äôm sure, sounds about as clich√© as it gets. But it can also
    be surprisingly calming. You don‚Äôt need to put on a salesperson persona for networking.
    You don‚Äôt need to wear suits and shoot finger guns while talking to new people.
    **Your passion for data science is more than enough.**

    that you are not currently working as a data scientist, but want to do so in the
    future. You are probably studying at a university or a similar institution. At
    this stage of your career, I would focus on the following five tips for networking:'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I‚Äôm sure courses in archeology or environmental law are interesting. Yet, you
    will probably not meet many future colleagues in such courses if you aim to be
    a data scientist. If you take courses in data science, statistics, or informatics,
    then this will be much more likely. The main reason to take relevant courses is
    of course to gain knowledge, but don‚Äôt underestimate the value of forming a solid
    network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When taking relevant courses, try to talk to different people and get to know
    them a bit. You don‚Äôt need to be incredibly social if you don‚Äôt want to, but **a
    little goes a long way**. Having formed connections with 5‚Äì10 people for each
    relevant course you take quickly adds up.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are able to work a summer job as a data scientist, then this is immensely
    useful for gaining connections. Some people use this to get a foot in the company
    and often get a job there after they have finished studying. Even if you don‚Äôt,
    then **having previous professional experience with data science is a big plus
    on any CV.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the networking aspect, working at a summer job will introduce you to mentors
    and colleagues that you can connect with. People will have real-world knowledge
    of data science, which is often quite different from the academic version. Forming
    a network here is crucial for your future career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When working in the summer job, try to get to know people outside the little
    bobble you will be put in. Have lunch with designers and chit-chat with product
    owners. Being in a summer job means that most people there will be very open to
    you asking questions and connecting. This makes the networking aspect a lot easier

    This is a great opportunity to talk with representatives from companies and get
    to know what they are all about. You might even find yourself some free food,
    which is always a plus as a student.
  prefs: []

    of it.

    working professionals.
  prefs: []

    to apply for positions or which positions are good. Professionals who mentor students
    like this are usually doing it since they love their profession, and know it inside-out.
    If you decide to participate in such a program, then make sure to come prepared.
    Have questions you want to ask ready and **respect the time of the mentor üôè**

    in your country. For most of us, this will be LinkedIn, so I will just refer to
    LinkedIn from now on. From talking with recruiters, I know that not having a LinkedIn
    profile at all is somewhat looked down upon. While I don‚Äôt necessarily personally
    agree, this hardly matters.
  prefs: []

    This is a convenient way to stay in touch with them. You can also use LinkedIn
    to advertise that you are looking for a job when that time comes. Many of my friends
    have found jobs in this way.

    scientists, data engineers, data analysts, and ML engineers in your career. Make
    sure that you have a good relationship with them and connect with them. Talk about
    data science and related disciplines by all means, but don‚Äôt shy away from talking
    about other things as well. Building a relationship with someone is usually easier
    if you know some simple things about them personally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you change jobs, you might find that someone in your previous communication department
    works there now. They can still give a recommendation based on your personality,
    even though they probably can‚Äôt say much about your data science skills. Talking
    to people from different disciplines is also a great way to **avoid being completely
    insulated**. Some of the best data scientists I know have minimal working knowledge
    of nearby fields.

    worked remotely myself, so I‚Äôm not discouraging remote work as a practice in general.

    a position. If you do choose a remote position, then you can put more work into

    This usually comes in the form of meetups, workshops, and conferences. All of
    these are good to attend from time to time to network. If they are good, then
    you might also learn a lot. While meetups and workshops are often free, conferences
    usually have fees that are quite expensive. You can **ask your company to cover
    this.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    There is little point in you going to a React workshop if you are not interested
    in front-end development. Find something that genuinely interests you ‚Äî otherwise,
    **you will just be exhausted**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, if you find a meetup that you like and have attended a few times, don‚Äôt
    be afraid to volunteer to present. People who organize meetups often struggle
    with finding presenters. You don‚Äôt need to be a senior data scientist to give
    a good talk. In fact, some of the best talks I‚Äôve seen have been from less experienced
    people.

    But this is not true. Even someone who has only 6 months of working experience
    can mentor a new graduate on some things. Think back on when you started your
    job. What would have been helpful to know? Maybe it‚Äôs something as mundane as
    where certain information is located. Or maybe how data science deployment works
    in the organization? This might be easy for you now, but challenging in the beginning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By mentoring others, you form a connection with them. They can come to you with
    questions, and you will try to assist them. It‚Äôs not surprising that many new
    employees think of their mentor (given that the mentor actually does their job)
    as **the person they know best**. So ask your manager if you can be a mentor for
    new employees as soon as possible üî•

    above is a very personalized way of doing this, don‚Äôt be afraid to do it through
    blogs or courses as well. If you write a blog post on a technical library that
    lacks good documentation, then many people will be grateful. Just make sure to
    pick a topic that you are comfortable with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that the new graduates don‚Äôt know version control software like Git? Offer to
    give a 1-hour course on it. Are colleagues complaining that it is difficult to
    understand when to use Pandas vs Polars vs Spark for data processing? Create a
    blog post for this where you take the time to investigate the differences. This
    can be valuable and great practice as well.'

    interactions is probably a good thing.
  prefs: []

    emulate such profiles. Have a clear picture and an inviting and professional about-me
    section. This should not take you many hours to write, but many recruiters care
    about this. You can do better than having a picture of your cat as a profile picture
    and a description that reads ‚ÄúI do that data stuff.‚Äù

    networking ‚Äî **you now have a pull-effect**. Just know that presenting well takes
    a lot of time:'
  prefs: []

    early. The earlier in your career, the more accepting people are of mediocre presentations.

    a serious impediment to networking at a senior level. For some it seems very shallow
    to judge someone on how they write. But the writing is often the only output the
    receiver can judge or even understand. Most stakeholders do not understand your
    clever hyperparameter search or your intricate data pipeline. If you can‚Äôt explain
    in simple terms why a project should be continued, then don‚Äôt act surprised when
    it is cancelled üò≤'

    (or more!) languages that we need to communicate clearly in. This sounds daunting.
    Luckily for us, writing clearly is mostly language independent. Start working
    on the language you use the most in your networking. You will quickly find that
    the **clarity of your other languages improves in parallel**.

    something of value. Whether this is a Python library that implements a new ML
    algorithm or a GitHub repo that demonstrates a cool use case is entirely up to
    you. It can also be an internal tool in your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    great originality. Maybe your organization uses poor data pipeline orchestration
    routines. Taking ownership and fixing this brings value, even though it has been
    done 1000 times before in other organizations. Try to create something that will
    genuinely help others.

    This opens many doors for networking, as you will be asked to speak about and
    write about your expert knowledge. Picking a specialized topic can be difficult.
    My best suggestion is to deep dive into something you really care about. If the
    topic is applicable in a wide range of settings, this is also a plus.
