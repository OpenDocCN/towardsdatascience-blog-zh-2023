- en: The pocket created by an offensive line is a crucial element of the passing
    game, as the quarterback needs a clean pocket to throw the ball accurately and
    on time. A good pocket provides the quarterback ample space and time to move and
    throw, while a poor one collapses quickly, forcing the quarterback to scramble
    or take a sack (unless the quarterback is Patrick Mahomes). While it is easy to
    visualize a good or bad pocket, quantifying its quality, and more generally a
    lineman’s performance, is not straightforward.

    the distance that a lineman moves from the ball snap until the next event occurs.
    Lineman stationarity can be calculated on every offensive play and is useful for
    evaluating the performance and fatigue of offensive lineman. By tracking the movement
    and strain experienced by lineman on each play, coaches and analysts can use this
    metric to gain insights into the overall effectiveness of the offensive line during
    a game. All metrics and visualizations were generated using data from the [2023
    NFL Big Data Bowl.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023)

- en: 'Lineman stationarity is a measure of how far an offensive lineman moves from
    their starting position on the field after the ball has been snapped. It is calculated
    as the difference in yardline position between the moment the ball is snapped
    and the first event that occurs after the snap. An event, in this context, refers
    to one of the following:'

    and Xe be the yardline they are on when the next event occurs. Lineman stationarity
    is defined as Xe−Xs.

    stationarity is very good at evaluating a lineman’s performance. In particular,
    we’ll see that higher lineman stationarities are indicative of better team and
    player outcomes.

- en: On this passing play, the right tackle had the lowest stationarity among the
    linemen, positioned about -8 yards from his starting position. The center had
    the highest stationarity at approximately -4.5 yards. It is important to note
    that lineman stationarity only reflects up and down field movement, as lateral
    motion is not taken into account. This can be seen in the play when the center
    moves laterally to help the left guard and tackle, but his stationarity remains
    low.

    allowed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic between these two distributions
    in the first 8 weeks of the 2021 season was 0.575 with a p-value of 1.05e-95 (essentially
    0). This is both statistically significant and a large effect size for the KS
    statistic.

    5.27e-234 (essentially 0). From this, we see that average lineman stationarity
    tends to decrease for worse pass results. That is, completed passes have the highest
    average lineman stationarity (-3.78 yards), incomplete passes have the second
    highest average lineman stationarity (-4.13 yards), and so on with sacks and interceptions
    having the lowest average lineman stationarity.

    to give insight into lineman fatigue. Consider the following line charts depicting

    a game. Vertical red lines indicate plays that a sack occurred.

- en: In all three charts, sacks occur during downward trends in lineman stationarity.
    For instance, in the first line chart, the offense allowed a sack on the 25th
    passing play of the game. Prior to the sack, we observe a clear downward trend
    in average lineman stationarity (we say that lineman stationarity for the current
    play is in a downward trend if the exponentially weighted rolling average difference
    in lineman stationarity is negative). Astonishingly, about 85.29% of sacks in
    weeks 1–8 of the 2021 season occurred when lineman stationarity was in a downward
    trend. This could indicate that the lineman were fatigued and subsequently giving
    up more ground on each play, eventually resulting in a sack. Hence, analyzing
    lineman stationarity for entire offensive lines, as well as individual linemen,
    could give us a direct metric of stamina, strength, and fatigue.

- en: In this article, we introduced a new metric called “lineman stationarity” for
    evaluating the performance of offensive linemen. This metric is based on the idea
    that a lineman’s ability to maintain a stationary position, or remain in place
    without moving, is an important factor in determining the success of a passing
    play. We found that lineman stationarity is strongly associated with both the
    overall performance of the lineman and their level of fatigue. While it is not
    a perfect metric, it does offer a unique, easily interpretable, and predictive
    way of assessing the performance of an offensive lineman over time.
