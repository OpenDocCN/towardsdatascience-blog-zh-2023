- en: First of all, I love R Markdown. It is a wonderful, robust, incredibly amazing
    tool. It can also look bad, so bad that your beautiful hard work can be lost in
    ugly formatting, especially when sharing with less technical audiences. This is
    not meant as an introduction to R Markdown itself (some good places to start are
    [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/))
    but rather for those who have created work in R Markdown and want to take an extra
    few minutes to make it polished and presentable. You’ve already done the hard
    work, time to make it shine.

    your readers in the dust. [There are numerous packages that can instantly improve

    how I would like them to appear in my html file. For example, I L-O-V-E love the
    way that long tables are cropped at 10 rows and then you are able to arrow forward
    to see additional rows. BUT when you knit your file, the whole shebang is unfolded
    and your neat report suddenly turns into a thousand pages of endless rows.

    I like the width to go across the whole screen so I usually stick with 100% for
    width and 400 pixels shows around 9 rows along with the column titles which feels
    right to me.
