- en: Ecological restoration projects often require investment to get activities up
    and running. In order to create carbon finance opportunities for forest growth
    and conservation projects, it’s necessary to be able to predict the accumulation,
    or avoided emission in the case of prevented deforestation, of carbon in woody
    biomass. This is in addition to trying to understand the likely changes in a wide
    array of other ecosystem properties, e.g. plant and animal species composition
    and water quality. In order to create carbon accumulation predictions, a common
    approach is to devote individual attention and research effort to projects in
    specific locations, which may be scattered across the globe. It would therefore
    be convenient to have a locally accurate and global map of growth rates, or other
    parameter values of interest, for fast “prospecting” work of determining ecosystem
    restoration opportunities. Here we describe methods to create such a map, derived
    from a machine learning model trained on data from a previously published literature
    review. [We then demonstrate the implementation of the map for Africa in a Google
    Earth Engine app](https://steve-klosterman.users.earthengine.app/view/africaglobalunrmodel).

    data from the U.S. and Sweden to create a global map of carbon accumulation rates.
    However, that work assumed a linear carbon accumulation model, which has more
    biologically-realistic alternatives. Here we show how to create a global parameter
    layer for a curve fit equation (the CR function). Our approach is similar to the
    work of Chazdon et al. (2016), creating maps of parameter values for the Michaelis-Menten
    equation in the Latin American tropics. However, here, instead of restricting
    the curve fit parameter model to linear combinations of environmental covariates,
    we used the curve fit parameter as the response variable of a statistical learning
    method (XGBoost), in order to capture any nonlinear or interactive behavior among
    features. We chose to depict growth with the CR equation because it is a flexible
    curve that can take on sigmoidal or logarithmic shapes, and is a standard approach
    for a simple yet biologically realistic tree growth model in the forestry industry

    growth data source we used, our model will be relevant to naturally regenerating
    forests. Other literature review efforts have been recently completed for monospecies
    plantations (Bukoski et al. 2022), and are underway for agroforestry systems (

    and our list of potential features. To aid in interpretability, one of our goals
    was to choose a model with as few features as needed to achieve good performance.
    We used [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (SHapley Additive
    exPlanation) values to determine feature importance and found substantial variability
    in model performance and selected features depending on which data was chosen
    for training versus testing. Therefore, we used 10-fold cross-validation for all
    model development as opposed to setting aside a single test set. We used [GroupKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold.html)
    so that measurements from a single site were not split between folds; in other
    words no fold had data from the same site in both the training and testing data,
    to reduce the effect of spatial autocorrelation in model assessment.

    for the corresponding validation folds to see how important the features were
    when used for prediction outside the training sample. We summed the mean absolute
    SHAPs for each feature across all 10 folds and sorted them in descending order
    for a “ranked choice voting” feature selection procedure. Starting with the feature
    at the top of the list and proceeding sequentially, we discarded all predictors
    with Pearson’s r > 0.8 that were lower on the list to reduce multicollinearity
    and begin the process of pruning the feature set. This step had a negligible impact
    on final model performance, and reduced the feature set to 41 features.'

    where the RMSE (root mean squared error) of the biomass estimate was within 1
    Mg AGB/ha (aboveground biomass per hectare) of the lowest RMSE, roughly a 1% difference
    — in other words the simplest model that was nearly “as good” as the best model.
    As a result of this step, the best models for different folds had different features
    and different numbers of features. To combine insights across folds, we performed
    a similar ranked choice vote to the previous step to determine which features
    should be considered for the final model, and their ordering (27 features).'

    by a narrow margin). Results of the final backwards selection (step 3) are shown
    above, while SHAP values for the final model, collected across validation sets,
    are shown below. SHAP summary plots like the one shown here, also known as “beeswarm”
    plots, have a row for each feature, and in each row a point for every prediction
    in the dataset (here the validation data). The points are colored by the feature
    value, the vertical offset indicates data density at that SHAP value, and the
    x-axis coordinate indicates the SHAP value, or the signed impact on model prediction
    for that sample (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). SHAP summary plots show whether high
    or low values of the features result in positive or negative impacts on model
    predictions, and their magnitude.

- en: Of the five features in the model, the most important feature is isothermality,
    which represents the magnitude of the day-night temperature swings in an area,
    relative to the summer-winter temperature swings. The values range from 0 to 100,
    where the day-night range is expressed as a percentage of the annual range. This
    relationship between diurnal and annual temperature is suggested to affect species
    distribution and be useful for “tropical, insular, and maritime environments”
    (O’Donnell and Ignizio, 2012). It may be an indicator of how readily a given environment
    supports tree growth, where larger feature values (larger day-night swings relative
    to annual) lead to higher predictions of *k* (faster growth relative to maximum,
    as seen in the SHAP value plot above). Isothermality is relatively large close
    to the equator, where annual temperature changes are minimal, and so also proxies
    for warmer temperatures generally. From the remaining features, the SHAP values
    tell clear stories that trees are predicted to grow more quickly toward their
    mature biomass in less windy places, and for the most part with more soil moisture,
    both physically and biologically sensible model behaviors. The relationships to
    the Palmer Drought Severity Index and soil carbon are more complex and interactive
    and we won’t go into their details here.

    years is shown below. This data product can be used for nearly instantaneous projection
    of natural forest regeneration, at high spatial resolution and over large geographic

    for this work, we are also investing research effort across the team into other
    possible approaches. These include statistical modeling driven more by remote
    sensing observations than ground observations, as well as process-based models.
    Remote sensing of metrics such as canopy height and biomass is done using LiDAR
    (Light Detection And Ranging) or SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technologies,
    which typically don’t have a multitemporal component by which one can track biomass
    growth trajectories over years and decades. Academic researchers and companies
    are building machine learning models with multitemporal remote sensing data (e.g.
    Landsat) as features, as a way to effectively extrapolate LiDAR measurements in
    space (e.g. Walker et al. 2020) and, more recently, time (efforts of [CTREEs](https://ctrees.org/),
    [Chloris Geospatial](https://www.chloris.earth/), and [Sylvera](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/mapping-forest-structure-across-the-landscape)).
    This opens up great possibilities, keeping in mind the limitations and difficulties
    of assessing tree size from space, and the ground validation required. Process-based
    modeling will provide another valuable perspective, especially with its capabilities
    to model details relating to biodiversity and other ecosystem services (see e.g.
    Fisher and Koven, 2020) and efforts to combine it with remote sensing to provide
    benchmarking data (Ma et al. 2022).

    maximum potential biomass. We plan to explore and compare a diverse array of modeling
    techniques, that leverage multiple ground-based datasets, in future work.
