- en: Plotting graphs in a rectangular area, such as a typical bar chart, is common
    in data visualization. Using these charts has the advantage of occupying the maximum
    space.

    creating a dashboard, can make the result unattractive or too dense.

    alternatives can replace them. Using different chart styles may return an aesthetic

    This is a limitation if the plotting area matters. Another thing to be considered
    is replacing the bar charts with timelines on the x-axis. Using multiple nested
