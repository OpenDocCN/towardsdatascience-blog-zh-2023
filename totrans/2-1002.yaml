- en: Today, I woke up, and the hashtag `#gpt-4` was trending on Twitter. Immediately,
    I thought that OpenAI released the next version of the most popular language model,
    and people were going mad about it. So, I started reading the top threads on this
    topic. To my disappointment, most of them were rumors about the release date,
    how big GPT-4 will be, and what it will be capable of, while the rest were memes
    from various Sci-Fi movies.

    hole named GPT-4\. The legend says that GPT-3 had about 175B parameters, while
    GPT-4 will have 100 trillion of them! How could that be possible? Another tweet
    reveals that GPT-4 will be a multi-modal LLM (Large Language Model), accepting
    audio, images, and video as input, not only text. Finally, several tweets direct
    dystopic scenarios from movies like the Terminator of Ex Machina.

    is a ridiculous thing… People are begging to be disappointed, and they will be."
    Were they? I think that those daydreaming Twitter accounts were. Is this a bad
    thing? Not at all!

    that none of it is happening. And how could it? Research does not progress at
    the speed of light. You can have this kind of velocity only by accident. For example,
    look at how Fleming discovered Penicillin.

    systematic and meticulous process to iterate over past achievements, gaining a
    few yards with every iteration. That's the methodology OpenAI has followed for
    many years, from the [first version of GPT](https://openai.com/research/language-unsupervised)
    in 2018 to GPT-4.

- en: In its press release, OpenAI says that you can't really tell the difference
    between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 when using them in a casual conversation. But when the
    complexity of the task increases, GPT-4 is more reliable. This means that, for
    most use cases, you won't even notice the upgrade. And how could you? ChatGPT
    is already impressive, and even if it makes a ton of mistakes, you could easily
    assume that you are talking to a human being who is not a straight-A student.

    Microsoft marketing department to answer. GPT-4 contributes to the advancement
    of the area as its predecessor did, and that's what matters. We just climbed a
    step higher.

    the interest in the field decreased along with funding. So, threads like the ones
    I read on Twitter this morning can only hinder the progress of the field, creating
    expectations that no one can fulfill.

    will not be forced into another period of disbelief. Disillusionment, yes, and
    that's a good thing because this process will reveal its true powers to us.
