    basic high school or undergraduate math and statistics is sufficient, unless you
    want to do more advanced analyses or machine learning in your job. Most of the
    time as a data analyst you will do some descriptive statistics on the data, like
    calculating average, min, max, median, standard deviation etc. Depending on the
    projects, you might also do outlier detection, hypothesis testing, linear regression,
    clustering and even machine learning. It depends on your job and how technical
    it is. I would highly recommend you read this classic book *‚ÄúHow to lie with statistics‚Äù*
    by Darrell Huff. It‚Äôs a really fun book to read, pointing out the most common
    mistakes we make when drawing conclusions from data. I think everyone who works
    with data should definitely read it.

    You can choose to learn PowerBI as well. But if you know Tableau, it should be
    quick to learn PowerBI and vice versa. In the future, we can expect to work with
    big data as a data analyst. So it may be useful for you to learn the big data
    versions of these tools as well, for example SparkSQL for querying big data, and
    PySpark for working with big data in a Pythonist style.

    analyses and results with them, and finally come up with the some insights and

    takes place in form of presentation, or documentation, emails, dashboard and so

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and never feel like you have learned enough. For me, even after 6 years I still
    feel the same way. But it is okay to have basic to intermediate understanding.
    A lot of things you can learn on the job, so don‚Äôt be too worried about not knowing
    enough from the start.
  prefs:

- en: Regarding Excel, I would encourage you to really master it. You want to know
    the basic things like the back of your hand, such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, Index match,
    conditional formatting, Pivot tables, etc.. You can go for more advanced tools
    like Macros and VBA to automate repetative tasks, and optionally PowerQuery if
    you need to connect different data sources. In a near future, a lot of the small
    tasks can be automated by AI. So the main competency we need is knowing how things
    work. It is much easier to ask ChatGPT to write some VBA code for you to fill
    an Excel template, if you already know how VBA works!

    language, for example SQL or R, it can be easy to transfer that skill to a new
    language like Python. When I first learned Python, I often tried to relate things
    from R which I was more familiar with. For example if I want to concatenate 2
    dataframes I would google ‚Äúhow to row bind data frames in Python‚Äù because that‚Äôs
    how I would describe it in R. In addition, all the basics like basic concepts
    like variables, data types, functions, lexical scoping are almost exactly the
    same. So overtime you will develop the intuition for how to do things and problem-solve,
    in whatever language. The rest is simply to practice!'

    as a data anlyst. Data visualization can be stand alone graphs that you can create
    in R, Python or Excel, or in the form of dashboards or presentations. For starters
    there are some good books such as Storytelling with data. For dashboarding, you
    can learn pretty quickly with some courses on Tableau or PowerBI, which are drag-and-drop
    tools with no coding required.

    a shot, just be sincere and polite in your message. If you have any kind of connection

    learning‚Äù. It may be true, but that is not what employers are looking for. You
    may want to frame it in a more assertive way, along the line of what you have
    done and what you could contribute. For reference also make sure to send the recruiter
    an up-to-date resume, this should include links to your portfolio projects like
    Github repos, portfolio website or other mentioning of your projects online.

    definitely leverage this. So even if you worked as a barista or cashere at a supermarket,
    this counts as your domain experience. Data analysis is nothing without context,
    without business problems. If I were you, I‚Äôd mention these experiences and try
    to link them with the job I‚Äôm applying for, try to tell a little story and show
    that what I learn from those experiences may benefit the company. It‚Äôs not always
    easy and straightforward, but I think it‚Äôs a very effective, clever strategy.

    it is not about simply doing the same thing cheaper anymore. Companies need to
    innovate and think outside the box if they want to stay in business. So as a data
