- en: I can attest to the fact that changing the type and number of roles in a business
    leads to many sleepless nights. Most organisations will simply choose not to address
    these changes directly because transformation is hard and emotional. The changes
    for most companies will take time to happen, slowly, organically and avoiding
    the need to make tough decisions. Sadly, that also means that many organisations
    won’t see the benefit that these changes could bring as quickly as they probably
    should.

    newly minted startups with heady growth plans, smaller but stable companies with

    tech teams of hundreds of engineers, and one group that I think will see particularly

    years ago, the impact of AI coding assistants (and low code tools) will be a further
    democratisation (and demystification) of the ability to create web, mobile and
    internal back office applications. Put simply, it will be easier for less skilled
    teams to ship products to paying customers.

- en: Even 15 years ago, the capital cost of buying servers and the expense of multi-year
    contracts for hosting services meant that the price of entry to launch a new product
    was prohibitively high for small businesses. With the growth of the cloud, entrepreneurs
    could scale on demand, with only a credit card (or free hosting credits) to their
    name. Today, the largest barrier to entry for founders with a product vision is
    the people cost of engineering, and these new tools stand to substantially reduce
    that cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today in most VC backed startups, the technology is considered to be a large
    part of the unique value of the business. There is a trap that many founding teams
    fall into, that building as much of the tech stack as possible increases the value
    of the business. To make matters worse, this is sometimes exacerbated by some
    venture capital firms who press their young portfolio companies for more vertical
    integration and a de facto ‘build over buy’ mentality that prioritises intellectual
    property ownership. There is a cachet to be seen to have a company full of tech
    genius which can prove irresistible for both founders and investors.

    burn (the rate at which cash reserves are spent) and cut one of the highest expenses
    in the business — engineer salaries. According to [this report](https://carta.com/blog/compensation-report-h1-2022/)
    by Carta, engineers typically make up 25% of the total headcount and 30% of total
    salary spend across their clients.

    [Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) and even integrations

- en: Smart startup founders in 2023 will start from a position of asking which tools
    they should be using to build their software, not whether they should be using
    generative AI tools. As these types of company benefit from having very little
    invested in existing teams, embedded technical biases and little legacy software
    to support, they will be able to take advantage of new skills and team structures
    from their inception.

    equivalent quality products, and also likely encourage them to have a far higher
    propensity to experiment, pivoting more quickly than more traditional peers.

    engineering teams, there will be a good opportunity to benefit from more productive
    engineers. Companies that choose to augment their teams with generative AI tools
    should see higher quality code, more automation, shorter development cycles and
    more cost effective development.

- en: With small and manageable development teams of 20–40 engineers, many of whom
    will have been with them for a number of years, these businesses are less likely
    to choose to reduce the number of staff. It will, however, be attractive to deliver
    more for the same cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to look will be to any outsourced development partners, especially those who are
    more traditional “[bodyshopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shopping)”
    firms who are providing engineering, test or other technical skills. In these
    smaller businesses, if permanent engineers can be made more productive, the easier
    call will be to cut outsourced and more expensive day rates on contract roles
    than to cut internally.

    a difficult choice in their long range planning — do they want to grow for the
    same cost, or maintain the same rate of product development for a substantially
    lower one?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Planning in these organisations is in years, not in quarters. Most will have
    long term relationships with a number of different outsourcing companies, as well
    as an internal mix of permanent and temporary technical staff. As we saw from
    our simple modelling before, the potential savings for companies of this size
    that choose to fully embrace generative AI tools are millions of £/$/€ each year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, although the financial benefits are significant, change in these companies
    is also hard. Established ways of thinking and of working, existing hierarchies,
    internal politics, the complexity of organisational change and the very significant
    cost of large scale redundancies will mean that planning is detailed and slow.
    While these companies consider how the changes may play out, it is likely that
    their teams will start to embrace tools themselves. As we’ve seen with other easy
    to use tech tools it will often be non-technical (but tech adjacent) teams like
    Marketing, that drive adoption. Inside product engineering teams themselves, there
    will be some drive to innovate and adopt tools, but understandably little effort
    to [reduce the number of roles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zvgcOrTtw) in
    the tech organisation.

    the benefits of productivity or cost savings will be slow to play out. However,
    for some enlightened and decisive organisations, the impact could be significant.

    challenges for outsourcing companies in the near future.

    and present opportunity for them to double down on the investigation of Generative
    AI tools, as they have the cash and incentive to resource their own teams to experiment
    with the tools and demonstrate best practice to their clients. There will be a
    temporarily rich seam, similar to the ‘Digital Transformation’ trend of 5–10 years
    ago, where these firms can offer consulting to help client companies adopt the
    new tools, offering training, frameworks and guardrails for their use. This will
    be especially comforting for more risk averse clients who will gain some peace
    of mind if they are receiving thoughtful counsel on Intellectual Property, security
    and data privacy issues that might otherwise be too significant for them to swallow.

    like Copilot and CodeWhisperer, and learned that four out of five of my developers
    could be replaced with AI tooling, my initial reaction would be to start considering
    all of my outsourcing spend. In order to protect my high value internal engineers,
    it would be a relatively easy philosophical decision to slash the funding going
    to oursourcing firms.
  prefs: []

    highly specialised consulting services there will be a lower impact, but in the
    case that clients are outsourcing to take advantage of technical resources in
    lower cost jurisdictions, there will be a very real and growing impact.

    those suppliers that have ongoing bodyshopping contracts to provide fairly generic
    technical resources to clients, rather than those that partner to deliver specific
