    service to customers based on how they think, feel, and act. With the emergence
    of the promise of one-to-one targeting, segmentations can seem crude and outmoded.
    However, when used correctly, segmentations still represent a potential source
    of enormous competitive advantage as a means of listening to customers and understanding
    their needs and desires.
