- en: When renewable energy comes to mind, people usually think about solar or wind
    power. These are the most popular renewable energy sources. Yet, ocean waves have
    great potential due to their consistency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could harvest energy from ocean waves around 90% of the time. This figure
    is about 20%-30% for solar or wind. You can check reference [1] for details. For
    example, solar technology only works during the daytime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides its consistency, wave energy is also more predictable than the above
    two alternatives. The main limitation of ocean wave energy is the production costs.
    At present, these are higher relative to solar or wind.

    (WECs). These devices are buoys that are placed on the surface of the ocean.

    varies over time. So, forecasting waves’ height is a key task for efficient energy
    production from ocean waves.

    Accurate forecasts can prevent coastal disasters, and protect wave energy converters.
    These devices might need to be shut down to prevent damage from large waves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The safety concerns are also related to the passage of vessels. A vessel requires
    a minimum depth of water for its movement. Large waves reduce the depth of water
    and this minimum may not be met. So, forecasting improves the efficiency of vessel
    movement, thereby reducing costs and improving the reliability of ports.

    wave at least 5 meters high. This threshold is shown in a yellow vertical line
    in the plot above.

    example, in environmental sciences models are used to predict the likelihood of
    natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods. Another example is engineering,
    where professionals use models to predict the chance of equipment failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a machine learning standpoint, the main challenge is the lack of information
    about exceedance events. By definition, exceedance events are rare. Models need
    to cope with an imbalanced class distribution, where the vast majority of observations
    are non-event cases.

    that is used to evaluate binary probabilistic classifiers. It quantifies how well
    the model is able to distinguish between the two classes. The AUC for our model
    is 0.94, which is a decent score.
