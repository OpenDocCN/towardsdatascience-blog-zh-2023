    understand if there is a proportional difference between school sectors and post-secondary
    outcomes, let’s follow up with a little more. We stated that the modelling was
    not intended to be causal, and is merely descriptive. This was prefaced by saying
    that there would be numerous factors that one might consider in a causal model.
    Well it so happens a proxy measure exists, ICSEA or Index of Community Socio-Educational
    Advantage.

    [ICSEA](https://www.myschool.edu.au/faqs#13) is a scale that identifies the socio-educational
    advantage of a school. This is a measure calculated by [ACARA](https://www.acara.edu.au/)
    (Australian Curriculum Assessment Reporting Authority) that factors in parents
    educational background and occupation, Aboriginal status of students and the geographic
    location of the school. The average value of ICSEA is set to 1000 with a standard
    deviation of 100, and hence higher ICSEA values refer to schools with higher socio-educational
    advantage.
  prefs: []

- en: There are an enumerate number of factors that can affect student performance
    and outcomes. We’ve simplified to something more tangible below. Starting on the
    left hand side, we can reasonably expect a parents level of education to be an
    influence on their child’s personal ambitions, parental education will influence
    their salary, and hence what suburb they afford to live in, putting them proximal
    to schools within certain sectors. We are going to reasonably assume that affluent
    areas have a greater mix of Independent and Catholic schools ahead of Government
    schools. These are a lot of fields and data points to collate, summarise and create
    regression models to test our causal assumptions. Fortunately ICSEA is our magical
    proxy measure for most of these input variables, and thus on the right hand side
    we have our simplified causal model.

    to address the first part of our DAG, the relationship between ICSEA and Sector.

    are not surprising. The average difference between Catholic and Government Schools
    is 46 points on the ICSEA scale, and 80 points between Independent and Government
    schools. The latter is almost a standard deviation away. Independent schools are
    on average 30 points higher then Catholic Schools. All these results are non-zero
    and real.

    university post-high school demonstrates a positive trend with ICSEA, almost uniformly
    across sectors. Contrary to this, proportion of students in employment post high-school
    is negatively correlated with increasing ICSEA. The impact of ICSEA is now becoming
    a little more obvious, so lets understand the expected differences of proportional
    outcomes by ICSEA across sectors, ANCOVA.

    between 1000–1100 ICSEA. Our estimates are more certain because there is general
    overlap in the schools in this space. Either side of these is reflected by a broadening
    of the uncertainty because of decreasing populations in the respective sectors,
    reinforced by our density plot above by sector and ICSEA.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally speaking the 50% of the posterior density largely resides between
    ±5% when conditioning on ICSEA for the bachelors outcome. This reinforces the
    positive relationship between ICSEA and school leavers attending some form of
    university education, with small bias towards Non-Government schools.

    this time incorporating the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA)
    as a scale that identifies the socio-educational advantage of a school as a proxy
    measure. We performed an initial Bayesian ANOVA to identify difference in posterior
    means of ICSEA across sectors. We then merged this with the outcomes dataset,
    performed a Bayesian ANCOVA to answer whether or not outcome proportion vary across
    sector when conditioning on ICSEA.

    throughout with DAGs. Our conclusion, that *Outcome Proportion _||_ Sector | ICSEA*
    is not unsurprising given what we understand about ICSEA. It was designed to capture
    an array of possible confounders in a single metric to describe a school or population
    level effect. For the purpose of this exercise it has allowed us to quantitate
    the mean differences across sectors, and found by in large to be neglible within
    ±5% ROPE.
