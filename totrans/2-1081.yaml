    universities in the country — with the hopes that it would land me a job in the

    a job in the field**.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I discovered that it was going to be a lot easier to land a job as
    a data analyst, since the role has a lower barrier of entry than data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because most data science positions require you to have a Masters degree
    in a quantitative field like statistics or computer science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t come from a technical background, it will be much easier to get
    into the field of data analytics than data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    communicate with company databases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It lets you extract data from large databases, transform the data, and use it
    to solve business problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is one of the most in-demand technical skill in data analyst job listings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I took a free course called [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198)
    on Udacity when I was starting out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will teach you all the concepts you need to know in order to start working
    with data in relational databases — such as data aggregation, joins, and even
    some more complex topics like subqueries and window functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The reason I’m recommending this Udacity course over thousands of other resources
    available on the Internet is because:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is straight to the point. It teaches all the SQL you need to know to become
    a data analyst. Other courses go deep into topics like ER diagrams and creating
    databases, which really aren’t necessary for a job as a data analyst.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are practice questions after each topic. After you learn a concept, they
    present you with a business problem. You need to write a SQL query to solve this
    problem using the concepts you just learnt.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    more by practicing — rather than simply consuming information from video content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    another person type a 100-line program.
  prefs:

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second thing that I did was to learn to use a Business Intelligence, or
    a BI tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Business Intelligence (BI) tools let you turn raw data into a dashboard or a
    visual format that people can easily understand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, a BI tool transforms data into **actionable insight**.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    **creating calculated fields**, **building dashboards**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with [Tableau being in higher demand](https://www.udig.com/digging-in/power-bi-vs-tableau/)
    according to a 2022 survey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    course to learn the basics.

    dashboard.

    more about.

    I know analysts whose only job is to build dashboards using BI tools.
  prefs: []

    visualizations, you can go deeper and specialize in dashboarding.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I know just enough to turn raw data into a functional dashboard.
  prefs: []

- en: 3\. Python (Optional)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, I learnt Python programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m going to say that this is an optional skill to learn for data analysts —
    it isn’t a strict pre-requisite for most roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**You should learn Python if**:'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the future.
  prefs:

    had some programming knowledge from my CS degree.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    doors for me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was able to negotiate for higher salaries, got multiple freelance programming
    roles, and subsequently transitioned into data science.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also found it much easier to pick up on other programming languages once I
    learnt Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if your only goal is to get a data analyst job as quickly as possible,
    you can skip this step.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you do want to learn Python, you can take Freecodecamp’s [Python for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw?si=-Wqf9see0gUW7CCF)
    course. And follow up with practice questions on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

    and present a lot of my analysis in Excel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because SQL and Python are overkill for many companies. A lot of them
    just store their data in Excel files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    since they are familiar with the interface.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the bandwidth to pick up too many tools, I’d recommend just learning Excel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data analyst jobs.
  prefs: []

    expertise, but it is a good start.
