    statement surprised me (knowing him and his astonishing career and capabilities)
    and retriggered my “impostor syndrome” side, which has been buried by my busy
    days.
  prefs: []

- en: Like him, though I’ve been working in a reputable company with quite good performance
    reviews and bringing real impact and value to the organization, I still question
    myself a lot. **Day to day, I pile up domain knowledge on a very specific product
    (within the company) and work using tools and platforms that are built into the
    company; not knowing whether these are the widely-used ones in the industry**.
    After some time, I also wonder whether my skills are still relevant and applicable
    to the industry if I decide to leave the organization one day (or even if I’m
    being cut off).
  prefs: []

- en: Out of my curiosity *and also insecurity*, I started the quest outside of work
    to level up myself and make sure I’m still relevant to the industry. In this article,
    I’ll be sharing the tips that I’ve learned along the journey. This can be useful
    for you — a tenured Data Analyst who has been in one role and organization for
    a few years — to secure your position in the job market and bring great value
    to the organization as a Data Analyst.

    be able to stay ahead, you need to ensure that you are standing on your current
    ground powerfully. In the Data Analyst context, this means you have solid foundational
    domain and technical knowledge.

    (very useful for exploratory analysis). You need to be able to grasp the problem
    and/or opportunity within a business context by posing the “right” questions for
    data exploration.
  prefs: []

    statistics**, **inferential statistics** (preferably in a programmatic language
    like Python or R), **data visualization** (Tableau, PowerBI, Google Data Studio,
    etc), and **data pipeline** (relational database, ETL) done well will be sufficient
    take you far ahead, helping you to understand the complex algorithm and systems
    down the line.'
