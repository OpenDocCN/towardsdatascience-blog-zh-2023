    are not suitable when it comes to having a better understanding of your business
    problem, which requires the most time in statistical modeling.

    activities in order to help the Business make actionable decisions. It will also
    guide you through hands-on to practice those statistical concepts using Python.

- en: In real life, it is hard to find and observe the populations. However, gathering
    a sample is less time-consuming, and cheaper. Those are the main reason why we
    prefer working with samples, and most statistical tests are designed to work with
    incomplete data, which correspond to samples.

    `(1) random` and `(2)representative` .'

    chosen randomly from the population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the population. For instance, a sample should not contain only men when the

    zero. This means that the right side of the mean value contains more value, and

    its tails compared to the rest of the distribution. It tells us if the data is
    spread out or concentrated around the mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    kurtosis. A low kurtosis is related to a more flat distribution with fewer data
    concentrated around the mean.
