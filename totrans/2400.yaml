    the books we read, especially in the machine learning realm. These writers possess
    an uncanny ability to translate the complexities of AI into words that are both
    informative and interesting is truly remarkable. It is my goal, through a series
    of interviews, to bring their stories to the forefront and shed light on the story
    of some of the well-known authors in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

  prefs: []

- en: '*Lewis:* Although we began the book in 2020, its origin story really began
    in 2019 when Leandro and I first started working with Transformer models. At the
    time, Jay Alammar‚Äôs amazing [blog posts](https://jalammar.github.io/) and [The
    Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)
    by Sasha Rush were among the few written resources available to understand how
    these models work. These articles were (and are!) great for developing understanding,
    but we felt there was a gap in guiding people on how to apply Transformers to
    industrial use cases. So in 2020, we had the somewhat foolhardy idea to combine
    the knowledge we‚Äôd learned from our jobs as a book. My wife suggested that we
    contact Thomas to see if he‚Äôd be interested in being a co-author, and to our great
    surprise, he agreed!'

- en: '*Lewis:* As you might expect from the title, this book is about applying Transformer
    models to NLP tasks. Most chapters are structured around a single use case you‚Äôre
    likely to encounter in the industry. The book covers core applications such as
    text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. We take
    a lot of inspiration from the fantastic [fast.ai](http://fast.ai/) course (which
    is how I got started with deep learning!), so the book is written in a hands-on
    style, emphasising solving real-world problems with code. In the early chapters,
    we introduce the concepts of self-attention and transfer learning, which underpins
    the success of Transformers.'

    Transformers for production environments and handling scenarios where you have
    little labelled data (i.e. every data scientist‚Äôs nightmare üòÉ. One of my favourite
    chapters is about training a GPT-2 scale model from scratch, including how to
    create a large-scale corpus and train on distributed infrastructure! The book
    concludes with an eye towards the future by highlighting some of the exciting
    recent developments involving Transformers and other modalities like images and
    audio.

- en: Writing a book on NLP is a bit like solving a complex data science project.
    Among various challenges, you need to design the use case and story for each chapter,
    find appropriate data and models, and make sure that you can keep code complexity
    to a minimum because reading long blocks of code is no fun at all. And just like
    any data science project, some chapters involved running dozens of experiments.
    For all these challenges, I found writing the book with Leandro and Thomas to
    be an extremely valuable experience! In particular, having co-authors with whom
    you can brainstorm ideas or sanity-check your code was especially helpful. Of
    course, one challenge that arises with multiple authors is trying to keep the
    same writing style throughout the book, and we were lucky to have great editors
    at O‚ÄôReilly to help us achieve this.

- en: We wrote this book for data scientists and machine learning/software engineers
    who may have heard about the recent breakthroughs involving Transformers but still
    need an in-depth guide to help them adapt these models to their own use cases.
    In other words, people like myself about 1‚Äì2 years ago! We envision our book will
    be most helpful to industry practitioners or those hoping to break into NLP from
    a nearby field (e.g. a software engineer who wants to build machine learning-powered
    applications).

- en: We actually wrote the whole book using Jupyter notebooks and a tool called [fastdoc](https://github.com/fastai/fastdoc),
    so every line of code can be executed in the accompanying notebooks that we provide
    on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks). I suggest having
    the book chapter and accompanying code side-by-side, so you can quickly experiment
    with the inputs and outputs while you‚Äôre reading. We are also planning some live
    events around the book‚Äôs release, so stay tuned on the [book‚Äôs website](https://nlp-with-transformers.github.io/website/)
    to find out when these events will happen.

    or colleagues who can deeply critique your ideas and writing. We were fortunate
    to have experienced writers like Aur√©lien Geron and Hamel Husain provide us with
    detailed comments on our drafts, and their feedback significantly improved the
    book. This type of feedback is invaluable because, as a writer, you sometimes
    forget which aspects were challenging to master the first time you learned a subject.
    In a curious twist of fate, Aur√©lien‚Äôs written the foreword to our book!

    Three-Body Problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))
    **by Liu Cixin** is one of my favourite series because it provides a really novel
    solution to the **Fermi paradox** ‚Äî i.e. why is there no observable evidence of
    alien civilisations, given the large number of stars with Earth-like planets?
    I also enjoy reading books and biographies about the history of scientific fields
    like physics and computer science. One recent favourite of mine is [**The Man
    from the Future** by Ananyo Bhattacharya](https://www.amazon.in/Man-Future-Visionary-Life-Neumann/dp/0241398851),
    which is about the life of the extraordinary John von Neumann. Although I had
    encountered some of von Neumann‚Äôs work as a physics student (he wrote a masterpiece
    on quantum mechanics), I was not fully aware of how vast his contributions were
    to mathematics and science at large. The book does a wonderful job of describing
    his work and the fascinating history around it ‚Äî highly recommended!
