    AlphaFold 2, in collaboration with the European Institute of Bioinformatics, has
    ushered in a new era of protein research. Here I’m presenting a summary of findings
    from two groundbreaking papers published in *Nature* this week, which delve into
    the depths of this protein universe. These papers employ innovative clustering
    algorithms, structural comparisons, and other adaptations of existing tools to
    work on large data volumes, to shed light on the structural diversity, evolutionary
    relationships, and functional potential of proteins at an unprecedented scale.**'

    from energy generation to cell division. While the sequencing of proteins has
    burgeoned over the years, thanks to advances in genomics, the determination of
    their 3D structures has lagged behind due to the dearth of scalable experimental
    methods. However, with the advent of AlphaFold 2, a revolutionary AI system developed
    by DeepMind, the landscape of protein structure prediction has been transformed.
    The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) now houses an astounding 200 million
    predicted protein structures, marking a milestone in computational biology.

    how to utilize AlphaFold 2’s protein models to unlock new insights into the protein
    universe. These studies leverage innovative versions of existing tools adapted
    to the huge volume of data in the AFDB; for example, modern versions of clustering
    algorithms and methods for structural comparisons. With these adapted tools the
    works explore the vast expanse of protein structures, their evolutionary origins,
    and their functional implications.

    closely related or even very similar, clustering helps to reduce complexity. Protein
    structures are not an exception.

    protein universe” by Inigo Barrio-Hernandez and colleagues, the authors tackle
    the monumental task of clustering all 200 million protein structures within the
    AFDB. They introduce a highly efficient structural-alignment-based clustering
    algorithm called Foldseek cluster. This novel algorithm enables the rapid grouping
    of proteins based on their structural similarities, a crucial step in understanding
    protein evolution and function.

- en: The results of this study are remarkable. The authors identify a staggering
    2.30 million non-singleton structural clusters within the AFDB, with a surprising
    31% of these clusters lacking annotations, representing previously uncharacterized
    protein structures. These unannotated clusters, although representing only 4%
    of all proteins in the AFDB, offer interesting glimpses into the undiscovered
    territories of the protein universe. Evolutionary analysis suggests that the majority
    of these clusters have ancient origins, while a subset appears to be species-specific,
    potentially signifying lower-quality predictions or instances of de novo gene
    birth.

    domain families and their relationships. Notably, the authors identify remote
    structural similarities, unveiling hidden connections between proteins. A noteworthy
    application of this newfound knowledge is the identification of human immune-related
    proteins with putative remote homology in prokaryotic species, illustrating the
    vast potential of this resource for unraveling protein function and evolution
    across the tree of life.

    universe,” portrayed in the lead picture of this article and authored by Janani
    Durairaj and collaborators, shifts the focus to exploring the ‘dark matter’ of
    the protein universe using AlphaFold’s predictions. The authors create an interactive
    sequence similarity network, connecting more than 50 million accurately predicted
    protein structures in the AFDB. This network serves as a powerful tool for unveiling
    the hidden facets of protein diversity.

    protein fold, aptly named the ‘Beta-flower.’ This previously unseen structural
    motif is characterized by petal-like hairpin turns reminiscent of a Beta-barrel,
    presenting an exciting mystery for researchers to unravel. Proteins featuring
    Beta-flowers are distantly related, yet their functions remain enigmatic, underscoring
    the boundless opportunities for future research.

    emphasizing the practical applications of their findings. Notably, they experimentally
    validate a new superfamily of translation-targeting toxin-antitoxin systems, TumE-TumA,
    underscoring the immense potential of large-scale efforts in identifying and annotating
    novel protein families.

    it into work for science. But analyzing the huge number of structural models as

    “Protein Universe Atlas,” a web resource offering an interactive view of the protein
    sequence similarity network that provides insights into protein diversity, community
    organization, functional annotations, and structural outliers. You can visit this
    resource at [https://uniprot3d.org/](https://uniprot3d.org/) to navigate the universe
    of protein models by interactively browsing and zooming through it, querying UniProtKB
    entries, listing components and communities, viewing protein sequences and structural
    models, etc. The resource facilitates exploration of the protein universe, uncovering
    new protein families, folds, and functional insights, thus benefiting research
    in structural directly. It offers some features to facilitate data visualization,
    such as coloring the nodes in which it is organized to enhance data visualization.
    And as it should be with any resource like this, data downloads are available
    and in various formats.
