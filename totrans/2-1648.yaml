    focused on very specific problems — which is good. We add most of our value by
    combining our focused attention and our skills to solve problems. But, I think

- en: Determinism is a philosophical theory about the nature of our universe. There
    are multiple different nuanced versions of determinism¹, but the overarching idea
    is that there is no randomness in our universe. Every event has a set of causes
    which entirely explain the event, and these causes themselves have a set of causes.
    The chain of causes is unbroken from the beginning of universe (or maybe there
    is no beginning of universe²?).

- en: The study of probability is largely about understanding how random variables
    behave. A random variable represents the outcome of a process with randomness
    in it. For example, the roll of a die. We can know a lot about how probable certain
    outcomes are, but we cannot predict the outcome of a single throw with certainty—
    presumably because of randomness.

- en: The theory of determinism rejects that there is any randomness in the universe.
    Why then do we have the field of probability, in which we study *random* variables?
    Of course, a indeterminist would say that there *is* randomness in the universe.
    But, a determinist would likely say that the whole field of probability was created
    because of the **‘epistemic limits’** of humanity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Epistemic limits** bridge the gap between perceived randomness in the universe
    and the theory of determinism. These limits can be defined as the boundaries of
    what can be known or understood. If the universe is truly deterministic, we could
    *hypothetically* know the outcome of every dice roll (think about Laplace’s quote
    above). If we were able to gather and understand the causal relationship between
    all variables that impact each throw, we could calculate with 100% confidence
    the outcome of the roll (if the universe is deterministic). Imagine, though how
    much we would have to know to make such a calculation! The imperfections of the
    die, the exact placement of the die in my hand, exactly how I shake my hand, the
    barometric pressure that day, the hardness of the landing surface etc.'

    = f’(x)*), and *x* is the exhaustive set of **all** features needed to predict
    *y*, would our model still have irreducible error? Or in the terms I created,
    would the ‘universal irreducible error’ be greater than 0? Determinism says ‘no!’
    Our model would be 100% accurate, because randomness does not exist. If error
    is not coming from other sources, there is no error! Universal irreducible error
    is always 0 in a deterministic world!

    Would you expect that a perfectly controlled experiment would have zero error?
    In other words, if we could completely isolate individual causes, and run the
    same experiment a million times, would you expect the exact same results, without
    any variation ever? If ‘yes’, you are well on your way to becoming a determinist!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Venturing into a perfect hypothetical world is a useful tool, but reality requires
    that we adapt to its imperfections. Of course we cannot perfectly control experiments
    — this is why the field of experimental design has provisions for handling apparent
    randomness and errors. Depending on our opinion of the universe though, we can
    see these accommodations as necessary only because of our epistemic limits (under
    determinism) or necessary because randomness is inherent in the universe.

    —remember, randomness doesn’t exist! Of course, going back again (I’m so sorry)
    to epistemic limits, the distinction between *random* numbers and pseudorandom
    numbers is meaningful because we can easily replicate pseudorandom numbers while
    *random* numbers would require a god-like level of knowledge to replicate. Sorry
    hackers, determinism is unlikely to be useful to you on this front… at least for

    philosophers have debated for literally thousands of years. Aristotle believed
    that observing chains of motion indicated that the universe was eternal because
    the chain can not have a beginning. Many medieval philosophers, like Thomas Aquinas,
    held that there was a first motion and that motion was God. Stephen Hawking opined

    in the context of a regression problem, the average model will likely have a test
    R-squared near 0 while the ‘god’ model will have a test R-squared of 1 always.
