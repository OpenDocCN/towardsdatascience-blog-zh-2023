    According to FindAMasters.com [1], universities around the world currently offer
    a total of more than 3,500 master’s degrees related to Data Science and AI.

- en: For me, I was motivated by a mix of career- and learning-related reasons. Before
    deciding to enrol, I spoke to many senior Data Scientists who had all told me
    that getting a master’s degree was objectively not necessary for pursuing a career
    in Data Science. I also already had a good undergraduate degree (so I didn’t need
    to show employers that I was academically capable), and I saw that there were
    enough online Data Science short courses to enable me to self-teach all the content
    I’d learn in a master’s. Nevertheless, as someone coming from a completely non-AI
    background (my previous jobs had been in Sales and Marketing), I knew that I would
    benefit from an intensive period of study, and felt like coming to Oxford was
    a bit of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

    depends. If you’ve already got a degree in a STEM-related field, for instance,
    getting that master’s might not do much to boost your job chances. This is *especially*
    true if you’ve already got another higher-level qualification like a master’s
    or a PhD. That qualification already demonstrates your aptitude with numbers,
    and another degree might not add much to your profile in the eyes of prospective
    employers. Rather, the limiting factor in your career development might simply
    be your lack of commercial experience in data/analytics. In that case, you’re
    better off trying to do things that plug the “experience” gaps in your CV, for
    example getting internships or lower-level jobs.'

    help you in your journey. The simple way to find out how necessary it is is to
    speak to people in the company/industry you’re specifically interested in. Try
    it: reach out to some senior/principal Data Scientists at companies you’d like
    to work at, and ask whether they’d consider a master’s degree a prerequisite for
    working there.'

    use of your time. At first, this might seem like a strange question. Surely, we
    think, full-time study is the best way to learn lots quickly? The thing is, however,
    while a master’s seems like an obvious way to achieve that goal, it’s not the
    only way, and might not even be the most efficient. During my master’s, for instance,
    it was compulsory to take papers in many subjects which were not directly relevant
    to Data Science (e.g., papers on survey design, the social science of the internet,
    etc.). Don’t get me wrong: these papers were very interesting and provided great
    fodder for [my portfolio](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-portfolio-that-got-me-a-data-scientist-job-513cc821bfe4),
    and I loved the broad academic experience which is hard to get outside of a university.
    But if you have very specific aims (e.g., become an expert in NLP), then doing
    a generalist/broad qualification like a master’s might not be a very efficient
    way of investing your time.'

- en: 'Considering the opportunity cost is a very helpful heuristic for evaluating
    the pros and cons of different opportunities. Ironically, for me an example of
    this came when I was *finishing* my master’s, when one of our professors was encouraging
    us to think about extending our studies into PhDs. His argument went something
    like this: employers rate PhDs much more highly than master’s degrees, so if we
    wanted to get top jobs, we should strongly consider extending our studies for
    a few more years and working towards PhDs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The thing is, however, this isn’t really a fair comparison, because if a PhD
    takes 4 years to complete, then really we should be comparing a PhD to a masters
    + 3 years of work experience in Data Science. And all of a sudden it seems much
    less obvious that a PhD is a good idea, given that 3 years of work experience
    adds an awful lot to a candidate’s profile in the world of AI.

- en: 'Don’t get me wrong; a PhD might still be a prerequisite for certain jobs. The
    point I’m making is that you need to look at all the options and compare them
    fairly. A simple way to do this is to think of your time as a resource that you
    can invest. Simply ask yourself: how can I invest this resource to drive maximum
    return on investment?'

    a higher-paying job afterwards. I know plenty of people who’ve done Data Science-related
    masters and are still looking for jobs. Despite what you may read online, it’s
    not a guaranteed that you’ll find a well-paying job, so don’t assume that any
    money spent on a master’s will be reimbursed via a job (at least in the short
    term).

    study part-time (i.e., alongside a job), apply to scholarships, enrol in a funded
    PhD instead, or get employee to sponsor your studies; I know several people who’ve
    made this work.
  prefs: []

- en: In my case, I took a few different approaches. First, I applied to as many scholarships
    as I could, and got a partial scholarship that covered a substantial portion of
    my fees. I also worked for a couple of years before doing my master’s degree,
    so that I had time to save up for it. Because of the large financial outlay, I
    was also laser-focused on getting a job, and made sure to apply to jobs early
    in the year and try and minimise the amount of time I’d spend “jobless” after
    finishing the degree.

    be good. Pay close attention to the specific modules and who will be teaching
    you. Find out about student satisfaction scores for the course and look at graduate
    outcomes. If you can’t find any official statistics about these things, see if
    there’s an open day or online taster event you can attend. When I was considering
    my master’s course, I reached out to the course coordinator with some questions.
    Others I know reached out to current students and alumni on LinkedIn to get their
    opinions. It doesn’t matter loads who you ask, but the more specific your questions,
    the better.

    regard to coding prerequisites. While some are pitched at newbie coders, others
    expect a much higher level of prior coding experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The important thing is to find a course that’s right for your level. For example,
    the master’s I did at Oxford tries (and in my opinion, succeeds!) to accommodate
    people from all types of academic backgrounds, but this meant that the first weeks
    were a bit of a “coding crash course”, and if you’re already got loads of coding
    experience then this would probably be very boring and a bit of a waste of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other things to consider are whether the course is a taught or research masters,
    whether it offers the chance to do work placements, whether it’s online/remote,
    and whether it’s full-time or part-time. All of these factors will affect how
    suitable it is for you. In my case, I had a bit of coding experience, but really
    wanted something that would be comprehensive and cover all the bases of a general
    Data Science education. Given that I had a social sciences and business background,
    I was also keen to pick a course that focused on the application of AI to problems
    in economics and business, rather than a purely theoretical course which downplayed
    the commercial and societal aspects of AI.

    is NOT the best way to find out. Sure, it is *one* way. But it’s also pretty much
    the most expensive and time consuming way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I reckon that a lot of people do master’s degrees as a way of putting off decisions
    about what to do with their lives. Don’t do this! Do a gap year instead, and get
    some practical work experience in the field to see if you enjoy the day-to-day
    work.
  prefs: []

- en: Ultimately, Data Science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider
    that data science might not be the right path for you. You might be more suited
    to an adjacent field like product management, software engineering, design, human-computer
    interaction, research, statistics, data visualisation, analytics translation,
    or something like that. There are tons of related careers out there, and you shouldn’t
    write off the less-well-known or less-hyped options just because you don’t know
    much about them. I tried a few different jobs before settling on my master’s,
    and I think they really helped me know for definite that AI was the area I wanted
    to go into. Plus, once you come out the other end of the master’s, having some
    prior commercial experience will help propel you into that next job.
