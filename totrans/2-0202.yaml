    organization, you’ve probably played with perfectly crafted data sets to solve
    toy machine learning problems. Maybe you’ve used K-Means clustering to predict
    flower species in the [Iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
    data set. Or maybe you’ve tried out a logistic regression model to predict which
    passengers survived the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
    voyage.

    they don’t mirror the real-world data you’ll come across on the job. In reality,
    your data can have quality issues, might not be perfect for the task at hand,
    or may not exist yet. This means Data Scientists often need to roll up their sleeves
    and gather data — a challenge often not covered in today’s data science curriculum.

    responses. However, to train a machine learning model to respond, we needed to
    craft a labeled data set.

    template responses. They then used these templates to respond to new requests
    which not only saved the client time but also helped to collect necessary labels
    to train a machine learning model.

    themselves, as this task can be both tedious and time-intensive. In addition,
    it’s a chance to showcase an early return on investment (ROI) to upper management
    — a task that’s [notoriously challenging](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/artificial-intelligence-roi.html)

    almost invisible. As you turn the steering wheel or push any of the pedals, you’re
    unknowingly labeling a dataset. In 2020, [Elon Musk](https://electrek.co/2020/04/30/tesla-fleet-training-orders-of-magnitude-better-elon-musk/)

    all emails so we could then directly pull the categories, but adding an extra
    step to their process wasn’t feasible. Instead, we subtly labeled the data set
    using the email templates, making it a seamless and natural process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the client began using the templates, they quickly needed to customize them
    which led to a challenge for us. We were labeling the data based on the original
    template text and now needed to track multiple versions of each template.

    to Genius’ approach for [identifying their scraped content](https://www.pcmag.com/news/genius-we-caught-google-red-handed-stealing-lyrics-data)
    on Google.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    without disrupting the user experience. Ideally, the system would capture the
    template used, but our current setup lacks this feature, making watermarks a cost-effective
    and creative alternative.

    learning into an existing one, leveraging existing production systems for data
    collection is key. This not only uncovers valuable user insights but also optimizes
    your approach.

    Users frequently [gravitate toward the default option](https://archive.uie.com/brainsparks/2011/09/14/do-users-change-their-settings/)
    due to its convenience and familiarity. When presented with a choice, the default
    serves as a starting point that requires no additional decision-making effort.

    into the data, I quickly realized that users from different regions had their
    own unique ways of categorizing documents. So, I ended up building separate models
    for each region to fine-tune the predictions. This approach allowed me to incorporate
    users’ preferences and behaviors into my models and ultimately provide them with
    more accurate recommendations.

    a machine learning model, this approach is often inefficient and can lead to diminishing
    returns. The humans labeling your data have limitations in terms of time, attention,

    well-understood or less informative. Additionally, the cost and time associated
    with labeling large amounts of data could outweigh the benefits of improving a
    model’s accuracy.

    to allow annotators to focus on the most valuable data points. Active learning
    is like having a smart student who knows which questions to ask the teacher to
    learn better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data. Just like a student learns by asking the right questions, active learning
    helps models learn by picking the most informative data to label.

- en: In a recent project, I had a limited window of a couple of analysts’ time to
    label data for a model that would predict a document’s retention policy. To make
    the most of their time, I used an active learning technique called [uncertainty
    sampling](/uncertainty-sampling-cheatsheet-ec57bc067c0b). This technique pinpointed
    data points the model struggled with, allowing us to focus on the most challenging
    examples and optimize the labeling process.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to uncover relationships. You might even create a predictive model to infer labels
    from this historical data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model learns from patterns it identifies in the historical data and then
    applies this learning to assign labels to new, unlabeled instances. This not only
    expands the value of your historical data set but also accelerates the process
    of collecting a labeled data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another powerful technique involves clustering your labeled data alongside historically
    unlabeled data to pinpoint the data that most needs labeling. Identifying clusters
    of data with no representation in the labeled data set ensures that you’re making
    the most of your limited resources.

    the retention policy and confidence scores using a model. From there, I sampled
    5–10 data points with the lowest confidence scores and sent this more focused
    data set to the analysts to label.
