    Most products based on location data are technically relatively simple and can
    be seen as a form of implemented descriptive statistics (e.g., the average amount
    of devices seen inside a store) or, worst case, those products are the raw location
    data themselves. Machine learning can bring a lot of value to this industry by
    saving costs, increasing product quality, and enhancing privacy.

    to a competitor''s store, where their customers are coming from, how many people
    moved from one area to another, and many more. However, working with location
    data is far from trivial and comes with one massive problem: **privacy**!'

    working with location data, individual privacy is the most important and, in the
    long run, probably the most challenging one for the industry. It does not matter
    if the location data in question is GPS data coming from mobile phones, Telco
    data, or Satellite imagery. Since the whole point of location data is to reveal
    a location, simple products (raw data or aggregated) do not rule out the possibility
    of reverse engineering and, thus, violating someone's privacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even “privacy-friendly” data transformations, like hashing the unique identifier,
    obfuscating the latitude and longitude, and aggregating data are hardly making
    reverse engineering impossible. In addition, even if a third-party company is
    aggregating that location data in a perfect privacy-friendly way, the individually
    identifiable data has already been sent digitally to that company and, with that,
    this sensitive data is not controlled by the first-party data owner or the individuum
    anymore.

    Raw GPS data is filtered and then only stay points are clustered together. Based

    the estimated person count for that store.

    and work or area demographics into the metric. However, the flow is always the

    event, correct for technical problems of the data, and aggregate all dwelling
    events in an area.'

    of foot traffic, especially when someone is interested in patterns over time.
    The technical sophistication, and mostly proprietary part, lies in the supply
    correction for a simple aggregation would be highly affected by the underlying
    issues in supply. Even small changes in the supply volume can have a massive negative
    impact on an aggregated data product without proper correction. Therefore, automated
    supply correction is key to a quality data product.

    to raise their paw when it just often enough receives a reward for doing so. This

    just one. In fact, machine learning usually uses a lot of features to train robust
    relationships. The benefits are manifold. For instance, when we think about our
    aggregated data problem coming from 1st party data providers, machine learning
    would allow us to learn relationships between those aggregates and a given target
    we would like to estimate (e.g., foot traffic to a store).

    a generally low market share, simple aggregation does not allow for a product
    since it would always end up with “0” counts. Given the general decrease in available

    does simply learn relationships between conditions. Similar to the dog learning
    that raising a paw leads to a reward, a machine learning model can learn that
    if more people are close to the venue, there are most likely also more people
    inside the venue.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, the purpose of machine learning is to train a relationship (or
    model) that describes how foot traffic inside a store changes based on fluctuations
    in traffic outside the store. For example, imagine that on a given Saturday there
    is a grand opening that leads to the situation that twice as many people are close
    to the store as on a regular Saturday. In that case, it is very likely that also
    more people make their way into the store.

    must not be linear. But that is also not the only relationship for a model to
    learn. Just think about it, what else affects foot traffic to a store that can
    be measured? Because, essentially, every data that relates to the store traffic
    improves the quality of the model. A few datasets that enhance those relationships
    are precipitation, area population, demographics, day of the week, holidays, and
    many more.

    Methods based on machine learning have the potential to bring additional value
    to this industry by reducing costs, increasing product quality, and enhancing
    privacy. We at Unacast believe that the future of the location data industry lies
    in a combination of early data aggregation in a non-identifiable format with machine
    learning techniques on top of these aggregates and, with that, create high-quality
    human mobility insights products.
