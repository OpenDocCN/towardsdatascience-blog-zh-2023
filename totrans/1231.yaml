    resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) framework. I talked
    to several vendors, most offering SaaS and priced by the total number of records
    ingested from sources. That totals in the 6- to 7-digit $ range per year for larger
    enterprises.

    and suppliers — a lookup table of join keys across all sources. We combine these
    with a consolidated view of the rest (orders, quotes, transactions, …) to overcome
    the abovementioned challenges.

    engineer similarity features, select (and fit) a classification model, and cluster
    matches. We can set rules (similarity thresholds) under which highly similar pairs
    are considered true matches automatically (red) and distribute a batch of likely
