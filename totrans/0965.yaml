- en: One of the most common questions that email marketers face is when to send their
    emails to maximize their open rates, click-through rates, and conversions. There
    is no definitive answer to this question, as different audiences may have different
    preferences and behaviors. What time zone are they in? What devices do they use
    to check their emails? What are their daily routines and schedules? How often
    do they check their emails? These factors can influence when they are most likely
    to open and interact with your emails.
  prefs: []

- en: You can use tools like A/B testing or split testing to compare the performance
    of different email campaigns sent at different times. You can also use analytics
    tools like Google Analytics or Mailchimp to track the metrics of your email campaigns,
    such as open rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, and conversions. By analyzing
    the data, you can identify the optimal delivery times for your audience and your
    goals.
  prefs: []

- en: When you have a good understanding of the click-through rates and open rates
    of your customers at different times, the next step is to create an optimal delivery
    schedule that maximizes these metrics on a segment without negatively influencing
    them to unsubscribe — a phenomenon that we call “Fatigue” in email marketing.

    In that effort, we created a reinforcement model that would suggest the next best
    offer to roll out to its mortgage customers based on their past responses. With
    that in place, now ULFC wants the data science team to recommend an optimal schedule
    — day, time, count — for sending out emails as a part of a quarterly email campaign.
    **The objective is to maximize customer engagement on the emails without losing

- en: A genetic algorithm (GA) is a method of finding solutions to problems by mimicking
    the process of natural evolution. GAs work by creating a population of possible
    solutions, called individuals, and applying biological operators such as selection,
    crossover and mutation to them. The individuals are evaluated by a fitness function
    that measures how well they solve the problem. The fittest individuals are more
    likely to survive and reproduce, while the less fit ones are discarded. This way,
    GAs can explore the search space and converge to optimal or near-optimal solutions
    over time. Here are the core steps involved in any use case you could possibly
    build with genetic algorithms.

    open and click rates for each day and timeslot. We add weights to open and click
    rate and this can be adjusted based on whether it is a conversion or an awareness

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary process that drives generations is that of **Selection**. In the
    practice of genetic algorithms, there are many definitions of this. The simplest
    one is to rank all candidates based on their fitness scores and choose the top
    N to pass their attributes to next generation. This method is called Elitism or
    the process of selecting elite candidates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other two process are **Crossover** and **Mutation**. These are two operations
    in genetic algorithms that help to create new solutions from existing ones. Crossover
    combines the features of two or more parent candidates to produce child candidates,
    while mutation introduces random changes in a candidate to create diversity and
    avoid local optima. The probabilities of crossover and mutation control the rate
    of change of the candidates in a population. A high crossover probability means
    that more children will be generated by combining parents, while a low mutation
    probability means that fewer children will be altered randomly. These probabilities
    can be fixed or adaptive, depending on the problem and the fitness function.

- en: Owned media like email and SMS can be very cost-effective and persuasive channels
    to reach an audience. But going a step further and optimizing schedules in email
    marketing can ensure that businesses are getting the most engagement from their
    emails. These projects also unlock many downstream analyses. For example, the
    team at HubSpot, a popular CRM software, publishes a report every year on “Best
    times to send an email” [2]. In their findings from 2023, emails receive the most
    engagement from 9pm-12pm. However, this data comes from surveying their clients.
    If you run an in-house schedule optimization in your company, you can produce
    such insights with much greater accuracy and granularity in a way that fits your
    business case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, as a caution, I would say use genetic algorithms carefully. And only
    if you know how to interpret and explain it in the context of your problem. It
    is just another optimization algorithm, and there are so many more which might
    be more explainable and faster. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, are robust
    and can reach global optimum pretty well.
