    expanding. But in that sea, there are precious pearls of insights waiting to be
    discovered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to finding these pearls? Data visualisation — the process of taking
    raw data and presenting it in a visually digestible manner that is easier to understand
    and interpret.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With data visualisation, you’re breathing life into those raw numbers, transforming
    them into a form that reveals hidden patterns, underlying trends, and crucial
    connections that the data might otherwise hide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among the arsenal of tools at our disposal for data visualisation, there is
    the famous Matplotlib.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This powerful Python library is versatile and robust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hidden within Matplotlib’s bag of tricks is a gem that you might not have come
    across before — the mosaic plot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These plots offer a powerful way of visualising categorical data across multiple
    dimensions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine being able to take a bird’s-eye view of your data, and understand how
    different variables interact and intersect. Mosaic plots let you do just that,
    presenting complex relationships in a straightforward and visually appealing way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be it discovering customer segments, making sense of user behaviours, or unearthing
    demographic trends, mosaic plots are a fantastic tool for researchers and data
    scientists to have up their sleeves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, we will discuss the world of mosaic plots. We’ll go over the
    process of creating mosaic plots in Matplotlib and also discuss how we can interpret
    them, giving you an added edge in your data visualisation toolkit.

- en: Let’s begin by comparing a mosaic plot to a tapestry of some sorts. Each intricate
    segment stands for a unique category within your data, with the segment’s size
    mirroring the frequency of that particular category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the tapestry functions as a mosaic plot, offering a visual representation
    that facilitates understanding of the interactions among various categorical variables.

    dimensions. Picture it akin to scrutinising a vibrantly coloured data Rubik’s
    cube.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From an external perspective, one can observe how disparate categories (or colours,
    following our Rubik’s cube metaphor) interconnect and blend.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you’re employed by a streaming platform such as Netflix, tasked with
    understanding the interplay between diverse age groups, genders, and various genres.
    Here, a mosaic plot shines. It presents a visual delineation of the frequency
    with which, for example, women aged 18–25 engage with comedy, contrasted against
    men in the same age bracket, or the propensity of the 35–45 age group towards
    thrillers.

    the ideal choice when precise, numerical comparisons are essential.*'

    data visualisation arsenal.

    consider weaving a mosaic plot to unearth the hidden insights.

    using Matplotlib, the process becomes relatively simple.
  prefs: []

    dataset for this example (refer to [https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=40945&status=active](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=40945&status=active)).

    of people in each passenger class on the Titanic, their survival status, and gender.

    to the plot.

    three classes on the Titanic: *First*, *Second*, and *Third*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The width of each section is proportional to the number of passengers in each
    class. In this case, it appears the Third class had the most passengers, followed
    by First and then Second class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within each class section, the plot is further divided horizontally into two
    sections representing `male`and `female`. The height of these sections is proportional
    to the number of males and females in each class. For instance, within the Third
    class, there are more males than females.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of the sex sections is then divided into two parts representing **Survived**
    and **Died**. The width of these divisions is proportional to the number of survivors
    and casualties within each gender in each class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in the ‘female’ section of the ‘First’ class, the green section
    representing ‘Survived’ is much larger than the orange section representing ‘Died’.
    This suggests that a large proportion of females in First class survived.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    while orange represent those who didn’t survive.'

    to have a think about what we’ve picked up along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We started off this journey by getting our heads around why data visualisation
    is so crucial. We got to know mosaic plots as a solid way to get a look at multi-layered
    categorical data, which lets us spot the detailed interplay between categories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we put together our very first mosaic plot using the titanic dataset. We
    also added colours, labels, and a headline to our plot that helped us spin a yarn
    with our data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The real strength of a mosaic plot is its knack for turning complicated data
    into a simple, visual story. But don’t forget, keeping things simple is important.
    Too many categories or a confusing colour scheme can turn a cracking plot into
    a visual headache.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, with this newfound knowledge tucked under your belt, you’re all set to
    kick off your own data visualisation adventure. Maybe you’ll use mosaic plots
    to understand how your customers behave in your online shop, or figure out voting
    trends in your local election. Whatever data you’re dealing with, the mosaic plot
    is your blank slate, and your findings are the colours you’ll use to paint it.

    with a variety of datasets. Practice makes perfect!

    mosaic plots weave the stories hiding in your data.
