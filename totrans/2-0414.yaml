    researchers don’t have strong engineering skills — and often try to run away from
    engineering work — which causes problems in having reliable, correct, usable,

    study, thus expanding the horizon of what is known by humankind, by growing or
    disproving existing knowledge.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases a scientist builds on top of existing knowledge to advance one
    step further. In some cases, some previous scientific evidence turns out to be
    wrong or misleading. For instance, the chosen sample could not be representative
    of the population at large and the results would then not generalize.
  id: totrans-19

    its results extrapolated to different conditions. An example in machine learning
    is when a method turns out to outperform the state of the art… but only when the
    training set is artificially small. In normal data conditions, it does not perform
    as well as the baseline.

    obsolete by [some](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/),
    is without doubts the peer-reviewed research paper. With research papers, scientists
    describe their discoveries in a structured and organized way. They describe the
    field of the discovery, the problem they address, the holes in the field of knowledge,
    their hypotheses, and their experiments that aim to bring evidence in favor of
    the hypothesis or disprove it.
  id: totrans-21

    and the discovery is worth to be published, in a process called peer review. Note
    that this is a tricky and imperfect system, and many times the peer review fails
    in publishing worthy research or, the other way round, allows for the publication
    of sub-par papers. No system is perfect and this is part of the game. A game that
    is the main process of scientific dissemination, and mostly decides the future
    of research funds and researchers’ careers.

    by Papi and colleagues [1], which takes as an example some widely-used implementations
    of Conformer [2]. Such implementations in common open source frameworks sped up
    research for many groups that did not need to implement conformer and training
    recipes for it by themselves. The problem is that all the implementations under
    exam contain three categories of bugs that show an impact on results when the
    inference batch size is larger than one. Note that, in a normal situation, inference
    batch size should affect the resource usage during inference, and thus the inference
    speed, but not the output.'

    Here, I just want to highlight that the differences are usually small enough to
    not notice there is a problem in the implementation, and that’s probably the reason
    why they went unnoticed for so long. Yet, in one case the degradation is huge
    when the batch size is very large.

    I would say this view misses the point. This paper only takes the example of **popular**
    implementations of conformer used by hundreds or thousands of researchers and
    practitioners around the world. Yet, it finds bugs in all of them, including one
    that is not easy to solve while keeping an efficient implementation.

    and maybe follow wrong directions based on that. Imagine working one year or two
    with a software tool that you consider reliable, then a bug is raised by someone
    and, when it is fixed, the performance of your new models suddenly drop. I think
    nobody would like to end up in this situation. And we know from the best engineering
    practices that errors should be found early in the process to minimize their cost.
