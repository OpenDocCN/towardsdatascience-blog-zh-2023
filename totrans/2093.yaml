    program by executing those tasks simultaneously instead of one by one. When making
    breakfast you don’t wait for the coffee machine to finish before cooking an egg.
    Instead you flick on the coffee maker and pour yourself a cup of orange juice
    while heating up the pan for the scrambled eggs.
