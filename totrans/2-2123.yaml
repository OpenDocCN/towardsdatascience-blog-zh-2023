- en: Data labeling is adding metadata or tags to a dataset to make it more useful
    for machine learning applications. The goal is to provide the machine learning
    algorithm with accurate and relevant information that it can use to learn from
    and make predictions. Data labeling is essential because it allows machine learning
    algorithms to understand and make sense of the data they receive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Different types of data labeling depend on the type of data being labeled. For
    example, text data can be labeled for sentiment analysis or named entity recognition,
    while image data can be labeled for object detection or semantic segmentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, the quality of labeled data directly affects the machine learning
    algorithm’s performance. If the labeled data is inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent,
    the model cannot learn from it effectively, resulting in poor performance.
