    everyone else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whilst the barrier to entry to Data Science is well known; only 2.4% of practitioners
    having formal education past higher education and over half having a Masters or
    PhD degree[1], another barrier is forming…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is now a *barrier to understanding.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is increasingly hard to understand what Data Science is, what it can offer
    and how it can be applied. Whilst it has always been a complex industry, recent
    advances have made it opaque to outsiders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This barrier has been growing over time and risks stalling progress on the application
    of AI. The huge amount of progress in Machine Learning and AI in recent years
    means nothing if this cannot be applied across industries, businesses and organisations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    models have been created for different use cases, with very different architectures
    being used for image recognition to natural language understanding and everything
    in-between.

    exponential trend in model size and complexity over time to achieve ever greater
    levels of performance.

    industry to continuously research and understand new architectures as they are
    created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it comes to the development of new models.
  prefs: []

    individuals or even small organisations. Only large internationals are able to

    the pace at which new ideas are created and shared within the industry continues
    to accelerate.

    to the conference has reduced significantly[2]. The pace of innovation is now
    so fast that papers not submitted risk being outdated by the next annual conference
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The volume, variety and velocity at which new papers are published is now far
    beyond the point at which any individual can keep up. A choice needs to be made
    to either focus on a specific area or accept that a wider view of the industry
    will also be a shallow one.

    the current status of development and what this means when it comes to real-world
    use-cases.

    industry, the third area that creates a barrier to understanding is entirely self-inflicted.

    where large amounts of effort are expended on climbing leader-boards rather than
    application of ideas in the real-world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The language of the industry is also becoming more technical in nature. This
    has been seen time and time again in more established professions such as law
    and finance; it serves to create a sense of identity and belonging to a community.
    It can also help to distinguish those that are knowledgeable in a certain field
    and those who are not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However technical language is also exclusionary and confusing. For a community
    built on the sharing of ideas it is a shame to see artificial barriers being built;
    there are enough already in place as it is.
