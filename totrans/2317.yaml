    I’m not talking about the awkward interviewers who left a scathing impression,
    watching you condescendingly, while you’re wishing for the pain to end. I’m talking
    about interviewers that have left a positive impression you cherish.

- en: The style in which interviewers conduct the interview plays a massive role on
    how an interview plays out. If the interviewer appears as an authoritative figure
    that cannot be pleased in anyway, even the best candidates may fold and get nervous.
    The candidates are at their best when they have someone approachable in front
    of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way I do this by is by making the interview almost a pair programming session,
    in which two of us are trying to get to the solution, rather than silently (somewhat
    sadistically) watching every move of the candidate while they’re grimacing at
    the question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I won’t lie, I used to root for “team scrutiny”. At the time, I believed the
    most important thing to evaluate the candidate on is to check if they can find
    to the solution on their own. On the job, time-to-solution seldom depends solely
    on your technical knowledge. Rather, it’s dictated more by factors like…

- en: Pair programming gives you a golden opportunity to test the candidate on these
    “soft-er” skills. So rather than a solo effort, the pair embark on a journey,
    harmoniously working to get to the final solution. To nudge the candidate in the
    right direction or to break the ice when stuck, I’d use phrases like “*tell me
    what you’re thinking*” or “*maybe start with pseudo-code*”. I’m not saying you
    should hand over the solution to them, but helping them to succeed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only this approach helps you to evaluate the candidate on a range of hard
    and soft skills, this leaves the candidate with a sense of accomplishment (as
    opposed to leaving them out to dry, should they get stuck).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key skill you must develop is not remembering the questions by heart (although
    that’s important), but having an acute situational awareness. Every candidate
    is different, and every interview experience is different. As an interviewer you
    must be able to play to the tune of that unique scenario.
  prefs: []

- en: If the candidate appears to be nervous, smile a bit more, ask about the weather
    and let them know you’re here to help if needed. If the candidate needs some personal
    space when solving a problem, give them that. If the candidate had technical difficulties
    at the start of the interview, give them a bit of extra time to make up for the
    lost time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only you have to do this during the interview, but afterwards as well. When
    evaluating the candidate, build a fair image of their performance by cutting through
    noise. Ask yourself questions like,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The candidates typically get more and more confident/comfortable as they go
    through the stages of interviews. Perhaps the candidate is having a really bad
    day! So as an interviewer, you need to be able to cut through these and evaluate
    the candidate on their skills. I’m not saying you should completely ignore these
    facts. Note them and communicate them to the other interviewers/recruiters. But
    if you expect an interviewee to be at their prime always, you’re in for some disappointment.
    Remember we’re all human! And this gives us a nice Segway to the second point.

    Thoughts like, “they should be waiting for me to enter, not the other way around”
    may creep in. Personally, it’s more important that I value someone else’s time
    the same way they (or I) do mine.

    work always. Rather it’s based on your ability to read the situation and the candidate.

- en: It’s important to take these advice/learnings with a grain of salt. They are
    not exact rules, nor there are exact measurements. For example, I’m not saying
    you should pass a candidate only because they were nervous. But give them a second
    chance if they got up to 80% of the answer and you know that it’s been a while
    for them and that they were quite nervous.

    experience. Sadly, I’ve seen interviewers mocking weaknesses of candidates afterwards.
    An interview for most of us is a really stressful experience and we all have made
    silly mistakes at some point. So try not to do that.
