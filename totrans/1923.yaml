    cities, surnames, companies, brands, years, months, dates, data science methods,
    and so on.'

- en: There are vertical bar charts (column charts) and horizontal bar charts. Column
    charts compare items through the height of vertical rectangular bars. Horizontal
    bar charts compare quantities through the length of horizontal rectangular bars.
    The final value of the rectangle (length or height of each bar) is proportional
    to the numerical value that is intended to be compared. Each bar represents a
    single item and some space is habitually left between them.

- en: Clustered Bar Charts (CBCs) show numerical information about the relative proportion
    that exists between a main item or category and its subgroups that belongs to
    a second categorical variable. A variable is called categorical if its observations
    can be assigned into non-overlapping categories. Usually, they can take one of
    a limited (usually fixed) number of possible values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to SBCs, they can be oriented horizontally or vertically. Each principal
    item is divided into a **cluster of bars** representing subgroups of the second
    categorical variable. The quantity of each subcategory is shown by the height
    or length of some rectangular bars that are located side by side forming such
    cluster, with gaps between clusters slightly wider than a single standard bar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CBCs are used for storytelling of Comparison and Proportion, but with an emphasis
    on Composition (**Part of a Whole Analysis**). Consequently, CBCs are particularly
    efficient when a whole is divided into **multiple parts**. They enable to make
    **comparisons** **across subgroups** (Stacked Bar Graphs make comparisons within
    subgroups).

    to sales, expenses, and profits for the 2016–2019 period. It is a vertically oriented
    CBC with years as the principal category. Sales, expenses, and profit are yearly
    represented as a cluster of bars. The chart shows that in 2018, although expenses
    increased significantly, profits were only reduced by a small amount.

- en: Overlapped Bar Charts (OVCs) are used when we want **to compare two numerical
    variables per item** or category in a single diagram. Of course, both numerical
    variables must be sufficiently related to justify a comparison.
  prefs: []

- en: The conceptual idea is to contrast the numerical values of two variables by
    means of their overlapping. Such overlapping allows us to tell the story with
    greater expositional power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to SBCs and CBCs, the classic layout is with two axis and rectangular
    bars that can be oriented horizontally or vertically. One axis shows categories,
    the other axis shows numerical values related to the variables to be compared.
    Of course, both numerical variables must share the same numerical scale. The width
    of the bars is different for each numerical variable with the smaller going forward
    for clarity of reading, although this situation may not always be possible for
    all charts.

- en: More than two numerical variables can be compared with a **partially overlapped
    bar chart.** In such type of charts, bars representing different numerical variables
    are partially hidden by other rectangles located in front of them. From a conceptual
    point of view, a partially overlapped BC is like a CBC when the rectangles representing
    the different subgroups begin to overlap instead of being located side by side.
    Great care must be taken to avoid confusing the audience. In this sense, it is
    only recommended to use them to compare up to three different numerical variables.

    between different items or categories. They compare only one numerical variable
    per item. They differ in that the LCs replace the rectangular bar with a line
    with a dot at the end. The corresponding numerical value is indicated by the **position
    of the dot** at the end of such line. So, the locations of the dots at the end
    of those lines are equivalent to the height or length of vertical or horizontal
    standard bars.

    display a **large number of similar values.** In this way, we avoid displaying
    a cluttered chart and we also prevent our audience from experiencing an annoying
    optical effect called Moiré pattern.

- en: A diverging bar chart (DBC) consists basically of two horizontal rectangles
    (bars) aligned so that one of the rectangles runs from right to left, the other
    from left to right, and both start from a common vertical baseline, usually located
    in the center of the chart. As already indicated, the length of each rectangle
    (bar) is proportional to the numerical value it is intended to display. Each bar
    represents an item or categorical variable and some space must be left between
    them. The best encoding for the DBCs is when two numerical alternatives are to
    be compared.
