    on getting data knowledge and landing a job. The job may seem to be the final
    goal, but it is not. If you begin your journey in a data field, the first job
    will hardly give you the desired level of earnings.

    out the details on your own. Many aspects that are well-known to your colleagues
    might be entirely new to you. Moreover, they might not even realize that these
    details are not obvious and overlook them during onboarding.

    begin. Don’t hesitate to ask what might seem like “stupid” questions. These questions

    you want to be a really nice person, write documentation of those obscure things,
    so you can share your learnings with the next person joining the team. This effort
    will not only make their first months easier but also boost your confidence and
    heal your imposter syndrome a bit.

    not to fully understand the industry and how the company operates during the first
    couple of months, but it’s essential to get the senior positions.

    are done in the field. Understand the actions behind the numbers, the reasons
    for specific reports, what drives the reporting, the benefits for owners, and
    the weaknesses and problems involved. Take a note about the last two and try to
    solve them in the near future.

    junior from senior data expert, but also business knowledge. Once you know the
    business process and its problems, you can bring true value to the team and company.
    While learning a new tool may take months, learning the business will likely take
    years, but you can speed it up by setting it as a goal.

    of the tasks given. You spent months learning Python, SQL and statistics but ended
    up making tables in Excel and bar charts in a BI tool. Or you learned some advanced
    concepts during your courses but are not yet entrusted to apply them in projects.
    If that is your case, there are chances that by the time you want to change the
    job, you will be amazed by your own portfolio projects because you completely
    forgot how to use these technologies. You will have to start from scratch rather
    than build new projects with a higher level of proficiency.

    well enough to move forward. By then, you’ll have a clearer idea of which area
    within the data job field interests you the most and focus on it. Or you might
    realize that your role expectations don’t match reality, and you’d prefer to switch
    to a related field. That is totally ok. There is still a lot of mystery behind
    data terms, making it difficult for new people to find the best fit.
