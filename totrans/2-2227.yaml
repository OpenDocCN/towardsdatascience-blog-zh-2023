    dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and doomsday scenarios. Robots
    are not going to take over the world. Yet, the current level of AI does pose tangible
    risks. Particularly to the trans and gender non-conforming community who have
    already been impacted by this technology.

    machine learning to warp your face, make you look old or even turn your dog into

    to predict a person's gender. This is done by analysing facial characteristics,
    body shape, clothing, voice patterns, or behavioural traits. Yet, gender is complex
    and cannot be fully captured by these aspects. This is especially true when it
    comes to trans people.

    12.7% and transmen 29.5% of the time on average. This is compared to 1.7% and
    2.4% for cis women and men [1]. These systems also completely ignore other gender
    groups.

    we do not distinguish between sex (gender assigned at birth) and gender (socially
    constructed roles). This issue is prevalent in healthcare models.
  prefs: []

    sex–gender-based medicine has been proposed [2]. In fact, little data has been
    collected that considers trans and other gender groups as a category. The result
    is models trained using a single binary feature — male/female, with sex assigned
    at birth being the proxy for both sex and gender [3].
