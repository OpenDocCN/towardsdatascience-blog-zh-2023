    that clearly sets data professionals apart in the working world. It’s vital to
    distill intricate information into clear explanations when working with convoluted
    topics, and the success of this effort hinges on the ability to bridge the gap
    between complexity and comprehension. This is particularly true when talking about
    the difficult topics found in data science, for example deep learning algorithms,
    Bayesian inference, and dimensionality reduction (to name a few).

    will incorporate all three, allowing the audience to comprehend your key message,
    take away information relevant to them, and have their queries and concerns answered
    in a satisfactory manner. With these 3 key guidelines, you can be assured of success

    understanding of your audience to be able to gauge their key concerns, base level
    of understanding on the topic at hand, and expectations for the presentation you’re
    about to give. This level of preparation is essential when dealing with any large
    audience composed of different stakeholders with differing motivations, all while
    delivering complicated source material effectively.

    this talk — what is the primary background of your audience? Are they specialists
    in the field or do they only possess a surface understanding of the material?
    Is this crowd interested in the inner workings of the project, or are they more
    concerned with the end result with less focus on the details? Does this audience
    include high-level decision makers in the organisation?

    for stakeholder management used across a wide variety of fields, from business
    to engineering— the stakeholder matrix, and the influence-interest grid.

- en: First to define what a stakeholder is — a stakeholder is anyone (person or group)
    with influence over a project or venture. In the context of delivering a talk,
    the project is the presentation itself — therefore a stakeholder is anyone who
    contributes to, or is affected by, the outcome of a presentation. These can range
    from data analysts who work directly on the data shown in the presentation, to
    executives who make decisions based on the presentation recommendations — it’s
    important to identify all individuals or parties who may be affected by a project
    so that you can capture all relevant concerns in your stakeholder matrix.
  prefs: []

- en: A stakeholder matrix is a relatively simple method of mapping out what your
    key audience members are interested in. It’s a table describing the key concerns,
    influence and interest levels of each stakeholder, essentially mapping out their
    positions on the topic at hand and how much influence and interest they have within
    this field. This becomes useful when deciding what approach to take for your presentation,
    and how best to display your information.

    within a large factory — the most likely attendees will come from the production
    department, quality control, maintenance & facilities, finance, and senior management.

    tailor your presentation towards — stakeholders on the top right are the most

    of the graph only need to be monitored. The diagram below explains the concept

    Management are the most important people to keep happy when giving your talk —
    however Factory Management have a high level of influence but do not have as much
    interest on the topic as Production or Quality. Finance ranks very low on the
    grid, so you should not spend too much time on considering their interests for
    the presentation. Facilities have low influence but high interest — since you
    would need their help to action any decisions made from this presentation, it’s
    important to keep them on your side.

    or educating your audience? Each of these objectives leads to a slightly different

    was low tool utilisation across the factory — is the purpose of your presentation
    to inform stakeholders of the issue, and display the metrics tracking this problem?
    Is it to persuade tool owners to utilise their tools more effectively? Or is it
    to educate engineering teams on best practices for maintaining high tool utilisation?
    Consider these questions and feed this into your stakeholder analysis, to ensure
    your presentation delivers the appropriate tone and message for the required task.

    subject matter — this will dictate the level of detail you’re able to go into
    when giving this talk. If you are scheduled for an hour then aim to fill up the
    hour with important details and elaborate on content as needed. However if you’re
    only able to speak for 5 or 10 minutes, then it’s essential to stick to the most
    pertinent details, addressing the most important points immediately and thoroughly.
    Don’t retread old ground if you’re in a time crunch — instead, state that these
    details are addressed in other forums (and provide this material if requested)
    then move on with the most current information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, it’s important to consider the audience’s base level of understanding
    when preparing the material — avoid spending too much time on well-known points
    but skim over these, instead prioritising new and impactful information which
    is more relevant to the discussion. Ask the question, would this information lead
    to new or important takeaways from this presentation — if so then it’s important
    to prioritise it in your slides.

    whole presentation — each point in your presentation may require a shift in tone
    and a change in approach to achieve the desired response. In some parts of your
    address you may be informing the audience of statistical findings — in describing
    other details you may switch to a more instructive tone to ensure those concepts
    are well understood before proceeding. You may switch briefly to a persuasive
    tone to argue a more contentious point, before returning to an informative stance
    for more well-agreed statements.

- en: Tying this all together in our earlier analogy — in preparing your stakeholder
    matrix and mapping this onto an influence-interest grid, you know that Production,
    Quality, and Senior Management are the most important stakeholders to appease
    for this presentation. Maintenance are also highly interested but don’t have as
    much power as these groups. Finance is low priority on the influence-interest
    grid and do not merit much consideration.

    while Quality want the tools to run as precisely as possible to minimise potential
    defects in the product. Senior Management are concerned with both outcomes, their
    objective being to output a large volume of high-quality product from the factory.
    Let’s assume your end goal is to drive higher utilisation across the factory —
    based on this information, what data do you need to prepare, and what tone do
    you need to use, to ensure a successful outcome from this presentation?

    vs. quality, these are the focal points you should emphasise in delivering your
    address — prepare data to show where improvements in utilisation do not lead to
    a negative quality impact. You will be *informing* the key stakeholders of these
    opportunities (in particular, Production and Factory Management) and *educating
    M*aintenance on how to improve utilisation on these tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where utilisation gains would lead to a quality impact, the language of your
    address must become more *persuasive* to convince Quality of giving concessions
    in tool precision. Prepare data quantifying the tradeoff between volume output
    vs quality impact, and identify what the most optimal balance would be between
    these two metrics to achieve the highest volume of quality product out of the
    factory. This will appeal to Factory Management, while aiming to appease the Quality
    department. In all likelihood, Quality will want to run through the details of
    this analysis extensively — prepare supporting material for this purpose. Describing
    this in detail will make it clear that you’ve conducted a thorough analysis, and
    should dispel any doubts as to the quality of your assessment.

- en: To summarise, understanding your audience is an essential aspect of preparing
    for high-level presentations on complex topics. By understanding stakeholders’
    interests and influence levels, it’s possible to craft tailored messages that
    resonate with your audience, and ultimately affect decisions after the fact. Additionally
    the strategic use of tone adds another layer of depth, shaping stakeholders’ perceptions
    and engagement to the material. When these techniques are integrated seamlessly
    in an address, presentations become highly effective tools to capture the attention
    of the audience, ultimately leading to more successful and impactful outcomes.
