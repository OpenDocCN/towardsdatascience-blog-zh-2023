  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Visually, I think scrollers are an amazing storytelling medium. I love the idea
    of being able to draw the reader’s focus onto specific parts of a visualisation
    and immerse them in the story I’m telling. It certainly beats my `matplotlib`
    bar charts with their sickly oranges and greens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The added bonus of D3.js is that you can build visualisations which are ready
    to be deployed directly onto a website. If you’re building visualisations with
    packages like matplotlib/ggplot2 or software like Power BI/Tableau, you’re reliant
    on using another tool to get your visualisation online. That’s not a bad thing
    (D3.js has a much steeper learning curve than those tools), but it does limit
    what you can do with your visuals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: D3 visualisations don’t have that problem; they’re completely customisable and
    can be embedded in a webpage however you like. For example, the charts you see
    in my scrolly above is called via a simple `figure` HTML tag (`id="myPlot"`) and
    embedded into a regular webpage.

    bit of a cog in a machine. You play an important role in your organisation, but
    it’s a highly specialised role and you’re highly dependent on other teams to make
    your work “actionable”.

    far enough. Based on my experience, it just sounds like a regular Data Scientist
    role! It makes me wonder what a non-Full Stack Data Scientist should do, if that’s
    what the Full Stack ones should do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, putting specific definitions aside, I love the ethos of trying to develop
    a broader set of skills as a Data Scientist (beyond the staples like Data Analysis
    and ML). And, perhaps controversially, I think that learning JavaScript is an
    excellent way to do that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why? Because (1) learning any new programming language makes you a better programmer,
    and (2) learning JavaScript in particular enables you to get your hands dirty
    with parts of the tech stack that you don’t normally see as a Data Scientist.
    I’m talking user interfaces, websites, working with certain APIs, and all that
    jazz. By learning JavaScript, I’m actively investing in the parts of the tech
    stack that lie upstream and downstream of the usual Data Science workflow. And
    having that knowledge is invaluable for understanding how my work fits into a
    bigger picture and allowing me to build my own full-stack projects like [theSQLgym](https://the-sql-gym.com).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and become more of a “jack of all trades” in tech more generally. In the long
    run, I think this will make me a much better Data Scientist, but I’d be lying
    if I said that was my only motivation.

    Builders gonna build, am I right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This lack of immediate relevance to Data Science makes learning JavaScript feel
    a little bit like switching to the Dark Side / stepping out of Data Science canon.
    But for now, I’m holding out hope. I feel like there’s something very valuable
    to come from learning JavaScript, and that it’s worth pursuing.
