    new features and capabilities of its platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last release note from OpenAI provides indeed a new cool feature to create
    your own customized version of ChatGPT, called [GPTs](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'GPTs are a way to increase even more your productivity. If you have been a
    user of ChatGPT, you might have already identified a long list of use cases that
    help you in your day to day activities : it can be optimizing your tweets, help
    brainstorm article ideas, generate variations of a sales pitch, review your code
    or help you learn Esperanto. GPTs come to play to help you make a “specialized”
    version of ChatGPT, personalized for your needs, and very good at one specific
    thing, instead of being very generalist.'

- en: For this article, I wanted to work on a real use case, coming from a pain point
    I faced in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In a previous professional experience, I had to manage customer facing GDPR
    topics. The GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a law in the European
    Union (EU) about data protection and privacy. It aims at giving people more control
    over their personal information and how it’s used. Yet, its implementation can
    be tricky. The text law is 150+ pages, and is quite technical. As a technical
    guy, it might be challenging to explore legal and regulatory topics. At that point
    of time, ChatGPT didn’t exist, so I had to upskill and get the help of an external
    legal expert to support me in the journey (which also increased costs), till I
    had more autonomy. But even then I always faced new topics like : addressing data
    cross-border transfers, managing security incidents, updating the privacy policy
    or making a data protection impact assessment.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I wanted to build, what I didn’t had at that point of time, a GDPR smart
    companion, available 24/7 that can help me with this topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, this is just a use case, but it is an interesting one in my opinion,
    as it addresses a clear need and have an obvious business case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you use ChatGPT, and ask about GDPR, ChatGPT has consumed “all the internet”
    (not exactly, but good part of it), so it does have some accurate information,
    but also some less accurate, and less precise. GPTs in this case will allow me
    to constrain the knowledge using specific options on GPTs that we will see in
    the guide, as well as tailor the language tone and some other tweaking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can apply the same logic afterwards and adapt the use case to your own needs,
    typically, if you want to build a Chatbot based on a knowledge database, a series
    of article, on a set of PDF, or similar use cases, you can follow the same steps.

    the following prompt “*I want to create a new GPT that will help answer GDPR related
    questions. It can be general questions related to GDPR (like the main principles),
    or specific to user situations (like, for a given security incident, is a notification
    required).*”

- en: I find the logo not that great, as GDPR is a European law, I think the logo
    should reflect that. However it is interesting to see that I got a logo representing
    security and privacy which are major pillars of GDPR. We can also see on the Preview
    part the logo (generated), a short description (generated), and examples of questions,
    called conversation starters, (generated as well). This helps you get a first
    sense of what the GPT will look like, and what questions it is expected to answer.

    well adapted to your needs. I provided the answers to those questions, and got
    confirmation that we are all set. It will also rephrase your inputs in a synthetic
    manner to show that it “understands” the input you shared.
