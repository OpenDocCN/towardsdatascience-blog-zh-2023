- en: Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. To help raise
    awareness and communicate the urgency of the problem, scientists and data analysts
    have developed a variety of ways to visualize climate data. One particularly effective
    method is the “climate stripes” visualization, first popularized by Ed Hawkins,
    a climate scientist at the University of Reading. In this article, we will walk
    through the process of reproducing climate stripes using Python, providing a step-by-step
    guide for anyone interested in creating their own climate stripes visualization.
    Whether you’re a climate scientist, data analyst, or just someone interested in
    learning more about the issue, this guide will give you the tools you need to
    make your own climate stripes and share them with others.

    it and the reader understands the message, without the need to get lost in the
    technical bits behind it.

    In September 2019, this visualization even made it to the front cover of The Economist,
    contributing to its popularity.

    relative to a 1961–1990 reference period. It can be found on [https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)
    and was introduced in the paper by Morice, Kennedy et al. [1].

    methods and the work to deal with biases in the data. The paper linked in the
