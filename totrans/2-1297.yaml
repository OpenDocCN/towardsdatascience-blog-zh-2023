    by an enigmatic group of extraterrestrial beings. They promise to let you go if
    you beat them in one of their games. You sit at a cosmic table with one of the
    aliens who distributes bags containing both a black and a white rock. When the
    game starts, every player will select a rock and put it on the table. The winner
    is whoever picks the rock with a different color. This means, whoever chooses
    black when the other two choose white or whoever chooses white when the other
    two choose black. Every time someone wins, they will give you a coin to pile up
    on your side of the table. You will play the game a million times, and the ultimate
    winner is the one with more coins at the end. Besides the rules of the game, the
    only other information you have is that the alien always plays black with a 50%
    probability. Seconds before the game starts, your partner whispers the strategy
    you should follow. After a million games, the final score declares both of you
    as the winners. Was this pure luck? How important was your partner’s strategy?

    above. However, the game proposed by the aliens can be extrapolated to a more
    realistic situation. Our lives are filled with multiple interactions in which
    we decide things either instinctively or deliberately. Many of these decisions
    depend on someone else’s decision and many others depend on events we cannot control.
    In any case, our responses are rarely random and more a product of our rational
    analysis. This means that in each interaction we face, we decide depending on
    what brings us the bigger benefit. This also means that we can have different
    strategies according to different interactions. This article is about the strategies
    we take, the payoffs we get, and [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

    Theory is an interesting field of Mathematics with many real-life applications.
    In Game Theory, strategic interactions between different agents are modeled mathematically
    and then these models are used to generate predictions or better understand a
    particular process. Depending on the type of interactions or number of players,
    the mathematical models can be very elaborate or a simple set of equations. Whichever
    the case, having a small glimpse into the world of Game Theory is not only interesting

    of each combination of choices. The first number is the payoff for group A whereas
    the second number is the payoff for group B. Specifying the payoffs is a very
    important part of a Game Theory analysis and it is not always straightforward.
    Payoffs can represent multiple things. In this case, we are arbitrarily assigning
    a number that represents how happy each group is with their choices. It would
    be like asking each group beforehand how happy would they be if they had hamburgers
    or pizza on a scale of 0 to 5\. As you can see, there is no way of having both
    groups with maximum happiness since in the case in which group A orders pizza
    and group B orders hamburgers, the pizza arrives late and group B will eat their
    hamburgers cold. However, this is not as bad as not eating hamburgers! The combination
    of group A ordering pizza and group B ordering hamburgers represents a solution
    from which neither of the groups wants to deviate. This is known as the [Nash
    Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#References).

    one’s strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. In the previous
    example, the solution (5,3) represents a Nash Equilibrium because group A cannot
    increase its payoff (it is already the maximum) and group B cannot increase its
    payoff either, a change in strategy will only reduce the payoff. Another classic
    example that is used to explain the Nash Equilibrium is the famous [Prisoner’s

    number of years they would spend in jail. This means that the smaller the number,
    the better the payoff. Since neither of the prisoners knows what the other will
    do, the equilibrium corresponds to the scenario where both prisoners confess the
    crime. Here is the tricky part: At first glance, the payoff table indicates that
    the best strategy for both prisoners **as a team** is to stay silent. However,
    they do not know what their partner will do. Even if they know that their partner
    will stay silent, the best strategy from an individual point of view is to confess
    since confessing would reduce jail time from one year to nothing. This means that
    the Prisoner’s Dilemma has only one Nash Equilibrium and is the strategy where
    both prisoners confess.'

    some interactions might have more than one Nash Equilibrium whereas other interactions
    might not have a Nash Equilibrium **if we only take into account** [**pure strategies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory)#Pure_and_mixed_strategies).
    Pure strategies correspond to a single and specific plan. This means staying silent
    or confessing or also buying pizza or buying hamburgers. On the other hand, mixed
    strategies assign a probability to each plan. We could say that a prisoner has
    a 75% chance of staying silent and, consequently, a 25% chance of confessing.
    **In any finite game, we can be sure that there is, at least, one Nash Equilibrium**.
    This equilibrium might be in a pure or mixed strategy form or also a combination
    of them. Now that we know this, it is time to sit back at the cosmic table with
    the aliens.

    There are 8 possible scenarios and in two of them, nobody wins. These are the
    cases where the three players select the same color. In the rest of the scenarios,
    someone wins either by selecting black when the rest select white or selecting
    white when the rest select black. This game does not have a pure strategy Nash
    Equilibrium since there is no strategy that satisfies all players. However, it
    does have a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium. Let’s calculate this first before
    solving the initial problem.

    equations that tells us the probabilities that represent a mixed strategy Nash
    Equilibrium. In this case *p=q=r=0.5*. Another way of looking at this is realizing
    that if the three players select the color of the rock with a 50% probability,
    then after an infinite number of games they will all get the same payoff. The
    [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for all of them
    is the same. This is a [link](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/blob/3c67c4b6acc32c9a6fadbb314f93cd96d998b749/GT/Game_Theory_Notebook.ipynb)

    we are not interested in finding a Nash Equilibrium among the three players. On
    the contrary, we are interested in finding a strategy in which we always win over
    the alien. The information we have about him is crucial. If we already know that
    he will play black with 50% probability then we can ask our friend to play black
    while we play white and this will guarantee that one of us will win each game.
    If we play this game an infinite number of times then the alien will end up with
    zero coins while we will split the rest of the coins. Table 3 shows a payoff matrix
    for only two players assuming the alien will play black with 50% probability.
    Note how there are two Nash Equilibriums, in which either Tom or Mike get a payoff
    of 1 by playing opposite strategies.

    always plays black with a 50% probability allows your friend to play black and
    you to play white (or vice versa) and win every game. However, if we had no prior
    information about the alien’s strategy, then our best option was to play black
    or white with a 50% probability. Game Theory is not only useful in hypothetical
    scenarios such as this one but in many other more realistic scenarios. Let’s review

    be difficult to answer this question since every TV is different. However, a quick
    Google search indicates that the value might be around 4% (0.04). If this is the
    case, then the cost of the PP so that the expected values equalize is 0.04 x 500
