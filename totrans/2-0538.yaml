    winning the race here. The programmer’s intention is immediately apparent and
    there’s no need to include any extra keywords or define additional functions.
    However, it’s worth noting that for more complex operations, separate transformation
    functions may need to be defined, which would take away some of the brownie points
    that list comprehensions generally receive for their readability.

    immediately gives away the programmer’s intent of, well, filtering something,
    perhaps more so than the list comprehension does. This is of course a highly subjective
    matter and will depend on the individual’s preferences and tastes.'

    for `map()`. List comprehensions are fastest, followed by `filter()` with a predefined

    a factor of 2 — and are typically perceived to be more Pythonic as well. Readability,
    however, is a bit more subjective with this one. While some people prefer the
    intuitive and Pythonic way of list comprehensions, others prefer using the `filter()`
    function as it clearly conveys its functionality and the intention of the programmer.

- en: While not as prevalent as in other languages, `map()`, `filter()`, and — occasionally
    — `reduce()` are still used and found in Python-based applications. However, list
    comprehensions tend to be seen as more Pythonic due to their more intuitive syntax
    and can, in most situations, replace `map()` and `filter()` functions, while also
    benefiting from a marked performance boost.

  zh: 尽管在其他语言中不如其他语言那样普遍，`map()`、`filter()`以及偶尔使用的`reduce()`仍然在基于Python的应用程序中使用。然而，列表推导式由于其更直观的语法被视为更具Python风格，并且在大多数情况下，可以替代`map()`和`filter()`函数，同时还带来明显的性能提升。
- en: By contrast, the nature of the `reduce()` function makes it hard and more cryptic
    to be replaced by list comprehensions. However, they can be replaced by low-code
    alternatives such as the `math.prod()` function, as we have seen above.
