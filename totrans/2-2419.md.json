Gonsalves\\nTowards Data Science\\nAug 3, 2020\\nMachineRay - https://medium.com/towards-data-science/machineray-using-ai-to-create-abstract-art-39829438076a\\nFor the past three months, I have been exploring the latest techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to create abstract art. During my investigation, I learned that three things are needed to create abstract paintings: (A) source images, (B) an ML model, and (C) a lot of time to train the model on a high-end GPU. Before I discuss my work, let\\u2019s take a look at some prior research.\\nThis is the first part of my series of articles on how AI can be used for creative endeavors. The second part is on how to use ML to generate plots for new stories, available  here .\\nBackground\\nArtificial Neural Networks\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created a computational model for Neural Networks (NNs) back in 1943[1]. Their work led to research of both the biological processing in brains and the use of NNs for AI. Richard Nagyfi discusses the differences between Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and biological brains in this  post . He describes an apt analogy that I will summarize here:  ANNs are to brains as planes are to birds . Although the development of these technologies was inspired by biology, the actual implementations are very different!\\nBoth ANNs and biological brains learn from external stimuli to understand things and predict outcomes. One of the key differences is that ANNs work with floating-point numbers and not just binary firing of neurons.  With ANNs it\\u2019s numbers in and numbers out.\\nThe diagram below shows the structure of a typical ANN. The inputs on the left are the numerical values that contain the incoming stimuli. The input layer is connected to one or more hidden layers that contain the memory of prior learning. The output layer, in this case just one number, is connected to each of the nodes in the hidden layer.\\nEach of the internal arrows represents numerical weights that are used as multipliers to modify the numbers in the layers as they get processed in the network from left to right. The system is trained with a dataset of input values and expected output values. The weights are initially set to random values. For the training process, the system runs through the training set multiple times, adjusting the weights to achieve the expected outputs. Eventually, the system will not only predict the outputs correctly from the training set, but it will also be able to predict outputs for unseen input values. This is the essence of Machine Learning (ML).  The intelligence is in the weights . A more detailed discussion of the training process for ANNs can be found in Conor McDonald\\u2019s post,  here .\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\\nIn 2014, Ian Goodfellow and seven coauthors at the Universit\\u00e9 de Montr\\u00e9al presented a  paper  on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)[2].  They came up with a way to train two ANNs that effectively compete with each other to create content like photos, songs, prose, and yes, paintings.  The first ANN is called the Generator and the second is called the Discriminator. The Generator is trying to create realistic output, in this case, a color painting. The Discriminator is trying to discern real paintings from the training set as opposed to fake paintings from the generator. Here\\u2019s what a GAN architecture looks like.\\nA series of random noise is fed into the Generator, which then uses its trained weights to generate the resultant output, in this case, a color image. The Discriminator is trained by alternating between processing real paintings, with an expected output of 1 and fake paintings, with an expected output of -1\\. After each painting is sent to the Discriminator, it sends back detailed feedback about why the painting is not real, and the Generator adjusts its weights with this new knowledge to try and do better the next time.  The two networks in the GAN are effectively trained together in an adversarial fashion . The Generator gets better at trying to pass off a fake image as real, and the Discriminator gets better at determining which input is real, and which is fake. Eventually, the Generator gets pretty good at generating realistic-looking images. You can read more about GANs, and the math they use, in Shweta Goyal\\u2019s post  here .\\nImproved GANs for Large Images\\nAlthough the basic GAN described above works well with small images (i.e. 64x64 pixels), there are issues with larger images (i.e. 1024x1024 pixels). The basic GAN architecture has difficulty converging on good results for large images due to the unstructured nature of the pixels. It can\\u2019t see the forest from the trees. Researchers at NVIDIA developed a series of improved methods that allow for the training of GANs with larger images. The first is called \\u201c Progressive Growing of GANs \\u201d [3].\\n\"},\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"# MachineRay: Using AI to Create Abstract Art\\n## How I trained a GAN using public domain paintings\\nRobert A.
