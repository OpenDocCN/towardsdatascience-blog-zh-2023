    which allows us to expose up to date and relevant information to a large language
    model. We’ll go over the theory, then imagine ourselves as resterauntours; we’ll

    resources alone. If we opened up a new restaurant, and wanted to use an LLM to
    answer questions about a menu, it’d be cool if we didn’t have to dish out millions
    of dollars every time we introduced a new seasonal salad. We could do a smaller
    training step (called fine tuning) to try to get the model to learn a small amount
    of highly specific information, but this process can still be hundreds to thousands
    of dollars.

    flat out wrong with abject certainty (commonly referred to as haluscinating).
    As a result it can be difficult to discern where an LLM is getting its information
    from, and if that information is accurate. If a customer with allergies asks if
    a dish contains tree-nuts, it’d be cool if we could ensure our LLM uses accurate
    information so our patrons don’t go into anaphylactic shock.

    term “guys” showed up in the prompt, i.e. “what pasta dishes do you guys have”.
    The info states that the restaurant was founded by “two brothers”, and the info
    would come up instead of the menu. These types of quirks are the reality of the
    art.

    augment the prompt, and pass it to an LLM.

    part in RAG and how embeddings can be manipulated to summarize a sequence of words.
    We went over using distance to get relevant information, then tied it all together
    with augmentation to query an LLM. In the end we created a chatbot that can leverage
    up-to-date information.
