- en: Data science is a vast domain that requires lots of experience and knowledge
    to master. In our journey to becoming a better data scientist, it is crucial that
    we regularly review ourselves, learn from and avoid any mistakes that we have
    unintentionally made.

    as a data scientist.

- en: 1\. Simpson’s Paradox
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is a relatively underrated area of data science. Simpson’s paradox arises
    when local data patterns are no longer observable when we combine the groups.
    This is better explained with an example:'

- en: We have a dataset of the churned customers of a ride-hailing app. We have noticed
    that for Area 1, customers with more mileage are more likely to churn. For Area
    2, customers with less mileage are more likely to churn. Lastly, for Area 3, customers
    with any mileage are almost equally likely to churn. In the diagram above, what
    can we see when we combine the three? It just becomes a massive pile of data without
    any obvious patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It might sound like a tricky problem to solve. But it might be us needing to
    approach it from the easiest angle. Some possible ways we can detect and potentially
    resolve Simpson’s paradox include the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should not just apply statistical analysis (preprocessing or model evaluation)
    on the entire dataset. Instead, we should split it up and run the same set of
    analyses across different slices — bins of numerical variables, categorical variables,
    class and labels etc. This can help us identify any local data patterns that may
    not have been significant across the entire dataset.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we have noticed Simpson’s paradox, one way of addressing this could be
    to train a different model for this group of samples assuming they are significant
    enough. A heuristic rule can be added to determine which model should be used.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another possible way to resolve Simpson’s paradox would be to introduce interaction
    terms to the feature set during feature engineering. In the example above, we
    can create a feature cross between area and mileage to magnify the different local
    relationships between the two features and the churn probability.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Garbage in, garbage out.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is true for any analytics function. We must emphasize more the importance
    of having data of decent quality. One measure of data quality is whether the dataset
    accurately represents the population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of selection bias can be a machine learning model that assesses the
    effectiveness of a new treatment for anxiety trained on data collected from a
    study group with most patients not suffering from the condition. While it is important
    to establish a baseline for the treatment, not including enough data points from
    patients suffering from anxiety significantly undermines the model's robustness
    and generalizability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is the target population?
  prefs:

    point of view?

    strategy.

- en: 3\. Confounding Variables
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One reason why our model may not be as effective as we have planned could be
    that we have missed some additional variables (confounding variables) that are
    both related to our independent variables (**X**) and dependent variable (**y**).
    That means instead of giving our models the easier job of finding the association
    between the confounding and the dependent variables, we are tasking the models
    to learn through the transitive relationship between our feature set and the dependent
    variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example could be an analysis of the probability of someone having lung cancer.
    It could be that there is a high proportion of males suffering from the deadly
    disease. But that may not be a very accurate conclusion unless we include data
    points such as smoking habits, air quality at home, occupational exposure to toxins
    and family history of cancer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once we start to include confounding variables, our model should expect improvement
    as we provide features that have a more immediate relationship with the dependent
    variables. We should also expect a more accurate conclusion regarding how important
    our features are to the dependent variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In general, we should keep reminding ourselves that correlation does not mean
    causation. When we are wondering whether we have missed any confounding variables,
    the following questions may help:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Are we expecting the features ranked as the most important to be that influential
    to the dependent variable?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How would a subject matter expert explain the interaction between the important
    features and the dependent variable?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose our logical interpretation of the relationship between the independent
    and dependent variables involves deduction steps (e.g. more men smoke, hence a
    higher risk of lung cancer). Can we include the intermediate variables in our
    feature set?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Heteroscedasticity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hetero-sce-des-tes-cas-ticity. Apart from how hard it is to pronounce the word,
    it is also a deadly trap for data scientists when unnoticed. Most of the time
    series analysis approaches works best when the variance of our data is steady
    over time. The trouble comes when the volatility of our data varies drastically
    over time.

- en: Even if the data at hand is not a time series, it does not mean we are free
    from heteroscedasticity. Imagine you are fitting a regression model between weight
    and height. The income level should be concentrated lower for a lower age group.
    As age increases, income should increase at a rate dependent on several factors
    (e.g. company, job change, career change, economic situation etc.), leading to
    a more sparse distribution. That means our model will be less accurate as age
    increase, even though we may have a high R-squared.

- en: 5\. Multicollinearity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common pitfall is multicollinearity. This is a situation where independent
    variables are highly correlated with each other. At a first glance, this might
    be a relatively minor issue. But it will make our solution unnecessarily complex
    or even unstable.

- en: Let’s say we want to build a model to estimate a marketing campaign’s success.
    The features used include click-through rates from Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads,
    TikTok Ads, and Google Ads, as well as the overall conversion rate. A set of well-formulated
    ads should expect decent click-through rates regardless of the platform in use,
    so the features regarding click-through rates should be reasonably correlated.
    Imagine you have joined this company, and your first impression to your boss is
    to reduce model complexity by at least 100% while having more stable results.
    You have just made a case for your promotion there.
