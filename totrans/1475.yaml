    Yet, our current approach — centralized data management — is failing. Enterprises
    are offered the illusion of greater control, yet see slow, inflexible, and bureaucratic
    processes that hinder innovation.

    data management approaches. Data Mesh is one of these “experiments”. And the early
    indications are that things are working.

    data management. Simplistically, these principles treat data as a first class
    product with clear ownership, accountabilities, supported by a self-serve platform
    and federated governance. Lots has been written about this [here](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Mesh-Delivering-Data-Driven-Value/dp/1492092398/),
    [here](/the-anatomy-of-a-data-product-d3140f068311) and [here](/an-architecture-for-the-data-mesh-32ff4a15f16f)
    so I won’t deep dive into Data Mesh specifically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather, I suggest that there is something even more fundamental about Data Mesh
    that is worth discussing. Simply put, the promise of Data Mesh is that it enables
    federation of data and federation of data management, which fosters local autonomy,
    which drives the speed, agility, and innovation required in today’s fast changing
    market.

    this case, the plethora of data products sprouting up in organizations — clearly
    has some downsides. But how can we tame the unruly evolution of federation and
    overcome these scaling issues?

    of principles is emerging that will enable federated data management to scale
    in a practical and efficient manner. These principles are organized into two categories:
    One set applies to data products and their owners, and another complementary set
    fosters rapid growth.'

    weighing of trade-offs, and relentless focus on implementation excellence. But
    the key success factor for growing your federated ecosystem of data products is
    the practical implementation and institutionalization of one single notion: **The
    Data Product Owner Reigns Supreme**.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    data product owner has final decision making — and veto power — over all elements
    of their data product. Yes, all decisions. And yes, they need to work within the
    normal bounds of good enterprise behaviour — they must obey senior management
    policies, regulatory constraints, and in some cases, profit & loss accountability.
    But they get to **decide** how to implement those policies, how to fit within
    regulatory constraints, and how to hit their revenue (or cost) targets. They **decide**!'

    decision rights, you will find a successful data product ecosystem and a growing

    can use any technology they feel will be most effective — even those against current
    enterprise standards — to build their data product. For example, a data product
    owner’s desire to optimize for agility, speed, and data product owner autonomy
    takes precedence over traditional cost focus and enterprise standards adoption.
    Now, to be clear, they should obviously prioritize consideration of existing enterprise
    standard products, but they are not beholden to them. And yes, they may need to
    incur the overhead required to bring in a new technology. But, again, they decide.'

    vouch for the integrity of their data supply chain. They own all the levers of
    data ingestions: The data product team, and not a central pipeline team, own the
    specifications of their data ingestion pipelines; and data product owners also
    have the skills to design and build the ingestion pipelines. And from a practical
    perspective, data product owners drive investment in management practices, tools,
    and instrumentation to proactively identify, diagnose, and quality, stability,
    or availability issues in their data supply chain.'

- en: '**Data Product Owners “certify” their data demand chain**: Data product owners
    attest — or certify — to the safety, trustworthiness, quality, and adherence to
    service levels. Data Product owners dictate consumption contracts (obviously in
    partnership with consumers). They also determine how those contracts are implemented
    and how they will meet service level expectations. And they proactively measure
    and publicly report on quality metrics such that data expectations are met.'

    other product offered to consumers by the enterprise, have a lifecycle. Now, while
    the lifecycles are similar, the emphasis within enterprise are almost always radically
    different. While owners of traditional products (those offered to, and paid for
    by, consumers) are expected to attain revenue and cost targets, this is almost
    never the case for internal products. Similarly, data product owners need to act
    like traditional product owners — they need to hustle, they need to sell, and
    they need to get as much support and momentum in the organization to — minimally
    — become self-sustaining, recognized, and funded.'

    diversity allowing wide range of ideas and approaches to flourish, rather than
    being suppressed or restricted. To make it easy to “let a thousand flowers bloom”,
    an enterprise should make it easy to create safe, secure, observable, and operable
    data products. It should strongly advocate a “test and learn” approach that is
    tolerant of experimentation.'

    a field of a thousand flowers, there inevitably will be weeds. Pruning the weeds
    is less important than providing the food and light (yes, the analogy is getting
    stretched to far) to the flowers. It is crucial to nurture the most promising
    and valuable data products, while also allowing for the natural process of selection
    to take place — and allow learning of what works, and what does not — to take
    place. Yes, poorly constructed data products will not be used, will lose funding,
    and should eventually die off. But, more importantly, valuable data products will
    replace them and hopefully thrive.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Make data products easy to find, understand, consume, and trust**: Enterprises
    must establish a consistent “registry” of data products that expose necessary
    data glossary, knowledge graph, governance information, and feedback. Enterprises,
    however, must also ensure that it is easy for data producers to create, certify,
    and govern data products in the registry. To make data trustworthy, data product
    consumers (and producers) must be able to provide feedback to data product owners.
    And to use the modern vernacular, they should be able to “like”, “up-vote”, or
    “star” data products. This “crowdsourcing” model has worked exceedingly well in
    software (GitHub “stars”) and social media (Facebook “likes”) and provide to data
    product owners a macro level view of data product quality and trustworthiness
    while providing invaluable information to data product owners. It almost goes
    without saying that the role of the “enterprise” is to provide the tools and utilities
    to make is easy to provide feedback.'

  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Simplify and streamline data product governance**: Enterprises should define
    an absolute minimum set of attributes, metrics, and service levels that each data
    product owners must provide. But enterprises must also provide the supporting
    tools and utilities to make it easy for data product owners to establish and publish
    this information.'
