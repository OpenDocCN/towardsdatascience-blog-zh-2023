- en: Although there are many resources to learn technical skills, there are few that
    go in-depth on how to clean data — an essential skill needed for data analysts.
    You may think you can apply the same set of rules to clean data but that’s not
    always the case. Today I’d like to share what I’ve learned over the years as a
    data analyst on how to approach cleaning different types of data for data analysis
    and reporting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By numeric values, I mean those useful for data analysis and reporting. A good
    rule of thumb is if the average would be useful. For example, the average of a
    numeric order number field is meaningless. However, the average revenue amount
    is useful.

- en: Calculate the ***minimum***, ***maximum***, ***median***, ***99th percentil***e,
    and ***average***. If the ***minimum*** is negative but values should be zero
    or higher, replace them with zero if applicable. In the sample sales data below,
    notice the large difference between the ***median*** of **$800** in **row 13**
    and the ***average*** of **$20,560** in **row 12**. If the median and average
    or the maximum and the 99th percentile have big differences, I typically check
    for outliers especially if I’m unfamiliar with the data. If you were to report
    average sales including the $100,000 in row 4, it would be $20,560 instead of
    $560 if you excluded the $100,000\. This is why it’s good to check for outliers
    and exclude them especially if you plan to report averages or use the data to
    build machine learning models as outliers can affect model results. Prioritize
    your time accordingly on the most important fields because you may have dozens
    to check and it would be too time-consuming to review all of them.

- en: 2\. Count missing and non-missing values. If the number of missing outnumber
    the non-missing, then the numeric field may not be usable in your analysis. For
    example, if you have 1,000 records but 900 of them are missing then the 100 non-missing
    values probably won’t be useful in your analysis. If the count of missing is less
    than the non-missing, then replace missing with zero when applicable. If missing
    means a value besides zero, replace it with a value you deem more appropriate
    such as the median or average assuming you’ve removed the outliers. For example,
    I once had a day of missing [DAU](https://baremetrics.com/academy/daily-active-user)
    ( daily active user ) data. Since DAU varied depending on the time of year, I
    took the average of the prior 7 days to replace the missing day’s DAU.

- en: '**Numbers Stored As String Fields**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Numeric values can be loaded into a database as a string value because they
    contain characters that need to be removed before they can be converted to a number.
    To identify these kinds of string fields, the rule of thumb again is to ask if
    the average would be useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of these kinds of string values are sales amounts with the currency
    such as $100.55 or numbers containing commas such as 1,000\. In these instances,
    you would remove the character value, i.e. delete the currency sign to convert
    to 100.55 and comma to convert to 1000, and then transform the string value into
    a number. After the string values are converted to numeric, apply the data cleaning
    rules noted above for numbers saved as numeric fields.

- en: Check for duplicates by the [primary key](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5547/primary-key)
    in the table. Primary keys are typically unique identifiers such as customer ID
    or a combination of fields that make the row unique in a table. When running a
    data analysis you want to ensure there are no duplicates in your data sources
    because this can cause you to report incorrect numbers.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Count the number of [null](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_null_values.asp)
    and non-null values. Determine if null values can be replaced with a string value.
    Sometimes I replace null values with ‘N/A’ or ‘None’ for reporting purposes but
    it depends on your requirements.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Count the number of rows for each unique string value and sort by descending
    row count. Look for string values with the same meaning and change them to be
    the same value.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the sample SQL query below in rows 1 to 7, I count the number of rows for
    each ***item_name*** value and sort by descending count. Since you may have hundreds
    of unique string values, focus on unique values with the highest row count and
    clean those first because changing values with a few rows will take too much time
    and probably won’t impact the results of your analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The SQL results in rows 1 to 3 show an ***item_count*** of 33 for ***apples***
    , 19 for ***apple***, and 17 for ***Apples***. ***Apples***, ***apple***, and
    ***apples*** can be changed to ***apple***. Rows 4 and 5 with ***strawberries***
    and ***strawberry*** can be changed to ***strawberry***. After data cleaning,
    the ***item_count*** shown in rows 1 to 2 have 69 for ***apple*** and 26 for ***strawberry***.

- en: 4\. Search and remove special characters as needed. This is common in non-English
    text or free-form text where tab and carriage returns may be part of the text
    that’s loaded into the database. Most string fields don’t contain special characters
    but if you get no rows returned when querying for a particular string value, special
    characters may be the cause.

    values are the same date format in the field and convert it to a date or datetime
    field as applicable to allow date functions to be used.

    a combination of the date and other fields that make the row unique. For example,
    a daily active user ( DAU ) table is the count of distinct active users per day
    and should only have one row per date. Another example is revenue by country where
    the date and country combined make the row unique in the revenue table. I once
    inherited an ETL job that didn’t remove the data from the same date it was updating.
    I accidentally re-ran the job for the same date and introduced duplicates in the
    revenue table. I realized this only because I ran the duplicate check or I would’ve
    overreported revenue to my stakeholders.

- en: When joining multiple tables with datetime values, confirm datetime values are
    in the same timezone. I once had to create a report to show the number of user
    upgrades 24 hours after an email was sent. The email table datetime was in CST
    ( Central Time ) but the upgrade table datetime was in UTC ( Coordinated Universal
    Time ). UTC is 5 hours ahead of CST. If I had just checked 24 hours from the email
    sent datetime in CST I would’ve missed 5 hours of users that upgraded after the
    email was sent. Fortunately, most databases have a SQL function called CONVERT_TIMEZONE
    to convert a datetime to different timezones. Check your database documentation
    to confirm.
