    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). As the demand for bigger,
    better, and more accurate AI and ML accelerates, standard computers will be pushed
    to the limits of their capabilities. Rooted in parallelization and able to manage
    far more complex algorithms, quantum computers will be the key to unlocking the
    next generation of AI and ML models. This article aims to demystify how quantum
    computers work by breaking down some of the key principles that enable quantum
    computing.

    superposition is the idea of existing in multiple states simultaneously. A condition
    of superposition is that it cannot be directly observed as the observation itself
    forces the system to take on a singular state. While in superposition, there is
    a certain probability of observing any given state.

    a thought experiment that encapsulates the idea of superposition. In this thought
    experiment, Schrödinger describes a cat that has been sealed into a container
    with a radioactive atom that has a 50% chance of decaying and emitting a deadly
    amount of radiation. Schrödinger explained that until an observer opens the box
    and looks inside, there is an equal probability that the cat is alive or dead.
    Before the box is opened an observation is made, the cat can be thought of as
    existing in both the living *and* dead state simultaneously. The act of opening
    the box and viewing the cat is what forces it to take on a singular state of dead
    *or* alive.

- en: A more tangible experiment that shows superposition was performed by Thomas
    Young in 1801, though the implication of superposition was not understood until
    much later. In this experiment a beam of light was aimed at a screen with two
    slits in it. The expectation was that for each slit, a beam of light would appear
    on a board placed behind the screen. However, Young observed several peaks of
    intensified light and troughs of minimized light instead of just the two spots
    of light. This pattern allowed young to conclude that the photons must be acting
    as waves when they pass through the slits on the screen. He drew this conclusion
    because he knew that when two waves intercept each other, if they are both peaking,
    they add together, and the resulting unified wave is intensified (producing the
    spots of light). In contrast, when two waves are in opposing positions, they cancel
    out (producing the dark troughs).

    so did the meaning of this experiment. Scientists discovered that even if a single
    photon is emitted at a time, the wave pattern appears on the back board. This
    means that the single particle is passing through both slits and acting as two
    waves that intercept. However, when the photon hits the board and is measured,
    it appears as an individual photon. The act of measuring the photon’s location
    has forced it to reunite as a single state rather than existing in the multiple
    states it was in as it passed through the screen. This experiment illustrates
    superposition.

- en: Standard computers work by manipulating binary digits (bits), which are stored
    in one of two states, 0 and 1\. In contrast, a quantum computer is coded with
    quantum bits (qubits). Qubits can exist in superposition, so rather than being
    limited to 0 or 1, they are both a 0 and 1 and many combinations of somewhat 1
    and somewhat 0 states. This superposition of states allows quantum computers to
    process millions of algorithms in parallel.

    explains the advantage of using qubits rather than bits with a simple example.
    Because everything in a standard computer is made up of 0s and 1s, when a simulation
    is run on a standard machine, the machine iterates through different sequences
    of 0s and 1s (i.e. comparing 00000001 to 10000001). Since a qubit exists as both
    a 0 and 1, there is no need to try different combinations. Instead, a single simulation
    will consist of all possible combinations of 0s and 1s simultaneously. This inherent
    parallelism allows quantum computers to process millions of calculations concurrently.'

- en: In quantum mechanics, the concept of entanglement describes the tendency for
    quantum particles to interact with each other and become entangled in a way that
    they can no longer be described in isolation as the state of one particle is influenced
    by the state of the other. When two particles become entangled, their states are
    dependent regardless of their proximity to each other. If the state of one qubit
    changes, the paired qubit state also instantaneously changes. In awe, Einstein
    described this distance-independent partnership as “spooky action at a distance."

    scientists have seen that if a particle in an entangled pair has an upward spin,
    the partnered particle will have an opposite, downward spin. While it is still
    not fully understood how or why this happens, the implications have been powerful
    for quantum computing.

    designed algorithms work across entangled qubits to speed up calculations drastically.
    In a standard computer, adding a bit, adds processing power linearly. So if bits
    are doubled, processing power is doubled. In a quantum computer, adding qubits
    increases processing power exponentially. So adding a qubit drastically increases
    computational power.

- en: While entanglement brings a huge advantage to quantum computing, the practical
    application comes with a severe challenge. As discussed, observing a quantum particle
    forces it to take on a specific state rather than continuing to exist in superposition.
    In a quantum system, any outside disturbance (temperature change, vibration, light,
    etc.) can be thought of as an ‘observation’ that forces a quantum particle to
    assume a specific state. As particles become increasingly entangled and state-dependent,
    they are especially prone to outside disturbance impacting the system. This is
    because a disturbance needs only to effect one qubit to have a spiraling effect
    on many more entangled qubits. When a qubit is forced into a 0 or 1 state, it
    loses the information contained at superposition, causing an error before the
    algorithm can complete. This challenge, called decoherence has prevented quantum
    computers from being used today. Decoherence is measured as an error rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain physical error reduction techniques have been used to minimize disturbance
    from the outside world including keeping quantum computers at freezing temperatures
    and in vacuum environments but so far, they have not made a meaningful enough
    difference in quantum error rates. Scientists have also been exploring error-correcting
    code to fix errors without affecting the information. While [Google recently deployed
    an error-correcting code](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00536-w)
    that resulted in historically low error rates, the loss of information is still
    too high for quantum computers to be used in practice. Error reduction is currently
    the major focus for physicists as it is the most significant barrier in practical
    quantum computing.
