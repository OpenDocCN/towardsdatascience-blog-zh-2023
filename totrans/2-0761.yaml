    apps. I loved the course, but it wasn’t particularly focused on *Data Science*
    use cases of Python, and before long I’d ditched it.

    got a habit of giving up on online courses— they often have dropout rates reaching

    for online coding courses. I’ve taken (and enjoyed!) many lessons on sites like
    CodeAcademy and Udemy, and I regularly recommend their courses to aspiring Data
    Scientists.

    of these, then **you’re at high risk of missing out on things that are vital to
    building a successful career in Data Science**. My aim in this article is to highlight
    these limitations so that you don’t have unrealistic expectations about what these
    sites can do for your career.

    iGeneration — we take it for granted that you’re rock-and-rolling after just a
    few clicks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But when you consider the historical context of Data Science education, that’s
    *staggering*. Before these sites came along, the main way to learn “Data Science”
    was through reading big books with scary names like *The Elements of Statistical
    Learning* and *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.* **Even the Slytherins
    among us have to admit that it’s pretty impressive how far we’ve come since those
    days.**

    who wants to learn how to **code**, chances are that you actually want to learn
    how to **code**, not install packages and get stuck on your command line. The
    fact that sites like CodeAcademy make it so easy to jump right in without the
    setup faff is a wonderful thing.

    experience as someone who only [recently made a career transition into Data Science](https://medium.com/@mattchapmanmsc/career-change-into-data-science-in-2023-was-it-worth-it-9e0c47b3b416),
    this was massively helpful. Why? Because *one of the hardest things about learning
    to code is knowing where to begin*. Which language(s) should you choose? In which
    order should you learn the various functions and methods? What kinds of problems
    should you solve?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Online coding courses take the guesswork out of this. By laying out a clear
    guided pathway, they show you the things you’ll need to learn and give you rough
    estimates for how long it’ll take to get there. I love this because it makes the
    goals really tangible. The fact that CodeAcademy offers Career Pathways (in addition
    to Skills Pathways) makes this even more true: aiming to complete the “Data Scientist:
    NLP Specialist” pathway feels much more achievable than some nebulous goal like
    “learn Python so I can do Data Science with words.”'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Science can’t be reduced to a bunch of coding languages; it’s much more
    than that. It’s a discipline that uses the scientific method to tackle problems
    with a hypothesis-driven approach. It’s *not* just about solving abstract coding
    puzzles like Fizzbuzz or the travelling salesman.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Don’t get me wrong: I’ve got nothing against those kinds of challenges. Solving
    quick puzzles is a great way to build your coding skills and practice solving
    out-of-domain problems, which is a fantastic skill. But these puzzles bear little
    resemblence to the types of problems you’ll likely encounter in your day-to-day
    life as a Data Scientist. In industry, you often need to start at the root cause:
    you take a business problem, translate it into falsifiable hypotheses or machine
    learning use cases and make a plan for how to tackle it with a Data Scientific
    approach. Being able to do this well is a vital skill, but sadly it’s one that’s
    difficult to teach through MOOCs or standardised coding courses.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, while these Browser-based IDEs are great from a speed and accessibility
    perspective, they come with their fair share of drawbacks. The biggest risk is
    that you can end up completing an online course without actually knowing how to
    run code outside of a specific platform. You learn the syntax, but don’t know
    how to execute code “in the wild” when solving real-world problems.

    copy and paste. The temptation to give in is overwhelming.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    get stuck, you can just use Google to find the answers to your questions. The
    fact that so many people take these courses means that someone has probably asked
    the *exact* same question before and received a perfect response outlining exactly
    what you need to do. This makes it incredibly easy to cheat and get through online
    courses without actually learning the underlying theories and frameworks.'

- en: Of course, there’s nothing wrong with “cheating” as a Data Scientist — it’s
    called StackOverflow! (That is, if we define cheating as looking for helpful hints
    from other people’s code). But typically with sites like StackOverflow, you can’t
    apply others’ code directly to your problem; you have to figure out how to adapt
    it to suit your specific problem. You don’t copy-and-paste; you copy-adapt-and-paste.
    Because you can often find the *exact* answers to the questions in online courses,
    you don’t always learn this copy-adapt-paste technique. You only learn how to
    copy and paste.

    quickly, but, as I’ve tried to show in this article, they’ve also got their limitations.

    to find ways of growing without their support.

    Data Scientist, you’ll need to learn how to translate business problems into concrete
    machine learning use cases and testable hypotheses. I talk about my own approach
    to this in ‘[How to Find Unique Data Science Project Ideas](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-find-unique-data-science-project-ideas-that-make-your-portfolio-stand-out-1c2ddfdbefa6)’.'

    needed to run code in the real-world** (e.g., GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, VS Code).
    Knowing how to code is essential for getting a job as a Data Scientist. But to
    run code in the real world, you’ll need to have a grasp of tools like GitHub,
    Jupyter, and cloud tools like AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Luckily, these tools
    have a low skill ceiling: it doesn’t take long to grasp the basics, and you can
    easily self-teach via free courses on YouTube.'

    IDE**. If you only do projects as part of online coding courses’ curricula, you’ll
    struggle to differentiate yourself and stand out from other applicants when you’re
    going for future jobs. In my experience, [creating an online portfolio](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-portfolio-that-got-me-a-data-scientist-job-513cc821bfe4)
    is an incredibly useful way to apply your new skills and showcase them to employers.
    My advice would be to take what you’ve learned in online courses and apply those
    skills to personal projects, outside of the courses’ in-built IDEs.'
