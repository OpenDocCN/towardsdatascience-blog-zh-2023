    recently. This trend is evident for me in the growing viewership of my articles
    and the increasing number of attendees at the workshops I facilitate on this topic.
    Concurrently, there has been an encouraging uptick in the valuable resources in
    this field. This represents a stark contrast to the landscape in 2018 or 2019
    when I first delved into this subject and found scarce useful information except
    for excellent books and other content published by [Cole Nussbaumer Knafflic](https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-Business-Professionals/dp/1119002257/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BKHX733YPUH8&keywords=cole+nussbaumer+knaflic&qid=1690882562&s=books&sprefix=cole+nuss%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C184&sr=1-1)

    insights.** It’s vital at this stage to evaluate the importance of our findings
    for the business, understand their origins, and identify the reasons behind their
    occurrence. Typically, this process requires multiple cycles of discovery, analysis,
    and conclusion drawing, which further refines the research scope and necessitates

    during the initial stage. They facilitate multi-dimensional data analysis through
    effective filtering techniques and enable the user to delve into details or take
    a broader view of the data using drill-down or drill-up functions. Consequently,
    they assist in identifying patterns or anomalies in the data.**'

    Nothing I saw in this BI platform (or any other) has convinced me otherwise. Because

    that enables users to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and/or key result
    indicators (KRIs), both financial and non-financial, that are crucial for running
    any business**. Generally, these dashboards are employed to present current or
    historical data, but increasingly, they are also incorporating forecasting or
    scenario planning capabilities. There are three key types of management dashboards:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the current situation?*” They often house real-time or very recent data.

    these usually showcase historical data for a broader perspective and frequently
    include financial data.

    relationships, or anomalies based on historical or predicted data.

    users, fulfilling distinct needs, and hence, necessitating varied design approaches.

    within the dashboard. At the very top, we should showcase the most vital, consolidated,
    and high-level information. Depending on the issue at hand, the user can then
    decide whether to engage with the rest of the dashboard. As we move further down
    the report page, the analysis can become increasingly intricate, encompassing
    additional dimensions or offering the capacity to drill down for more detail.
    Toward the end (or perhaps to the side) of the report or key visual, a dedicated
    recommendation area should be included. This should help users understand whether
    the observed changes are positive or negative, and what implications they may
    hold for the business. For example, this could take the form of a forecast generated
    directly within the dashboard.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another critical aspect of dashboard design is the creation of a visual hierarchy.
    The goal is to ensure that all important elements are easily visible and readily
    accessible. This can be achieved by manipulating colors, sizes, or spatial positioning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Below, I present two examples illustrating the application of visual hierarchy.
    The top image demonstrates how a chart can alter upon selecting a measure (“Current
    year”). The bottom image, on the other hand, offers a perspective on visual hierarchy
    applied at the report level. Both these visualizations were crafted using Power
    BI.

    essential to align all visuals appropriately to avoid inadvertently implying that
    one is more or less significant than the other. Most contemporary dashboard tools
    offer alignment features, with guidelines being particularly handy. The following
    image illustrates the use of such guidelines in Power BI.

    **allow your dashboard to breathe**. Keeping this in mind while designing your
    report will lead to a more user-friendly layout. It will help prevent information
    overload and enhance the likelihood of effectively communicating the intended
    message. Here’s my rendition of what a well-balanced dashboard might resemble
    (white is actually grey).'

    what visuals will indeed be utilized? Undoubtedly, the following three stand out:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    my opinion, interactivity spans two dimensions — one at the level of the tool
    or process, and the other at the level of the data or report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    three perspectives:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. The ease of accessing data and enabling collaboration. For example, can
    users share the dashboard internally and externally (keeping security concerns
    in mind)? Is IT intervention required to access a report or can users manage this
    independently?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    patience for slow-performing dashboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**At the data or report level, interactivity can be introduced through the
    following tools:**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. Filters and sliders: these are commonly used. The higher the recipient
    is in the corporate hierarchy, the fewer filters should be present on a single
    dashboard page. These filters should also function across tabs and allow for a
    global reset (i.e., removing all filters from a specific tab or the entire dashboard).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. Alerts: emails or push notifications help motivate users to visit the dashboard
    when new data is availalbe. They must be balanced in terms of content and frequency
    to prevent them from ending up in spam folders.'

- en: '**5\. Communicating with the recipients**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One aspect that often gets overlooked by many designers is the dialogue with
    the recipients. It can manifest in various forms. One such form includes documenting
    all necessary definitions, calculation assumptions, or even the name of the report’s
    author or owner, making it easier for individuals to seek clarification about
    the report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A novel form that’s available in Power BI is the “intelligent narrative.” While
    it’s not flawless (especially in languages like Polish), it can provide some fundamental
    information about the visualizations displayed on a particular page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, tool-tips represent another mode of communication, and they can typically
    be customized to suit user preferences. Thanks to tool-tips, users can obtain
    precise information on a specific data point.

    of effort, dashboards can become powerful tools in the storytelling process. By
    focusing on thoughtful report design and visual hierarchy, selecting the right
    visuals, incorporating interactivity, and actively engaging with dashboard users,
    you can elevate your data presentation to a whole new level. **Let’s harness the
