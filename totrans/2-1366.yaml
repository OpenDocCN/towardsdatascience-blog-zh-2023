- en: Deep learning is one of the hottest topics in data science right now — hello,
    [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). Data Scientists at the forefront
    of this field understand that deep learning is quite different from many other
    areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Feature engineering, or
    the process of creating and transforming inputs for models, is one of those key
    differences. Leaders in the field like Francois Chollet, Software Engineer at
    Google, say that “deep learning removes the need for feature engineering” (1).

- en: Before we dive in, we first need to understand how features are generated in
    machine learning and deep learning. In traditional machine learning, you don’t
    usually use raw data as inputs for a model. Instead, you make adjustments and
    transformations to it to improve model performance.

    want to use the text of the document as a feature, but you likely won’t feed the
    raw text into a model. Instead, you might represent the text as a vector of word
    counts.

    understanding the problem and creates a numerical representation of the data that
    makes it easier for the model to learn the task at hand.

- en: At face value, this word count may seem very simple, and you may wonder if a
    human is even needed to create this feature. But by the time you clean up the
    data set through various steps such as removing punctuation, normalizing text,
    and removing stop words like “the” and “of”, the feature word counts look quite
    different from the counts on a raw data set. All of these feature engineering
    steps allow for the machine learning model to better see the signal through all
    the potential noise that can come from complex data such as text.

    to this was through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision.
    Creating features for a model to determine the difference between cats and dogs
    in an image is a herculean task in many ways. But with the advent of CNNs, feature
    engineering in the field of computer vision essentially became obsolete. CNNs
    ushered in a new age of allowing the machine learning model to determine the appropriate
    features for the task.

    news, can we rely on deep learning for everyday business problems that need machine
    learning? Like many things in life, I believe the answer is “it depends.” In the
    case of computer vision, I believe feature engineering is obsolete, but this is
    only one niche. Let’s explore a few areas where I believe feature engineering
    is vital.

    the job — it’s just not called that. Day in and day out, I find team members who
    use Excel, Power BI, or Tableau to create calculations on their raw data set before
    creating visualizations with these calculations. Many of these calculations are
    what Data Scientists refer to as feature engineering!

    it as a line chart for a business stakeholder to review, a Data Scientist might
    use that ratio as a feature for a machine learning model. For some reason, Data
    Analysts don’t think of this as feature engineering.

- en: Features are not only used to help machine learning models learn. They are used
    to help people learn too. Just like Data Scientists, Data Analysts work with complex
    and varied data. This reality means that feature engineering is vital to the Data
    Analyst being able to extract features from the data which makes the visualization
    more insightful.

    usually comes at a cost of interpretability. Many real-world business problems
    require interpretability. In fact, certain use cases are even required by law
    to use interpretable models.
  prefs: []

- en: Take for example the credit industry. If you have a model that approves or denies
    someone for a loan, you must be able to explain in layman’s terms why the model
    denied someone a loan. Unfortunately, deep learning models are not interpretable,
    so Data Scientists in the credit industry are often required to use simple traditional
    machine learning models which require feature engineering.

- en: Feature engineering allows you to create and select features that are more meaningful
    and interpretable to humans. By carefully selecting and creating relevant features,
    you can make it easier to understand how your model arrived at its predictions
    and how it may perform in different scenarios.
  prefs: []

- en: Additionally, interpretable models can be more trustworthy and easier to deploy
    to production because they are more transparent and easier to maintain. When a
    model is not interpretable, it can be difficult to understand why it is making
    certain predictions. This can make it challenging to debug and improve the model,
    as well as to identify and fix any issues that may arise.

    the quality of the data — garbage in, garbage out. While many Data Scientists
    may think of feature engineering as a step in the process of building a model,
    it can also help Data Scientists improve the quality of a data set.

- en: I’ve built features for monitoring the quality of data on many projects. One
    of my favorites was with wind anemometer data. The anemometers would go bad for
    a whole host of reasons. One of the techniques we used for identifying bad data
    was to take the ratio between anemometers at the same height and scatter plot
    this against the wind direction.

- en: While there have been impressive advancements in the world of deep learning,
    the need for Data Scientists and Data Analysts to build features has not become
    obsolete. In many ways, it is needed now more than ever in an ever-increasing
    world of complexity.

- en: Feature engineering allows Data Scientists and Data Analysts to transform raw
    data to better represent the underlying structure and relationships in the data.
    Additionally, it allows them to ensure data quality by identifying and addressing
    any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values that may affect the performance
    of models, or lead to incorrect analysis. Ultimately, feature engineering is a
    valuable skill that’s here to stay for Data Scientists and Data Analysts alike.
