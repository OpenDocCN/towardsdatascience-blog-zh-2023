    I was reporting directly to the CTO of the company. This, of course, was a fantastic
    way to have my work noticed and receive credit for the successful and timely delivery

    data scientists with access to large datasets, more compute power, and a wide

    have a basic understanding of the entire data science cycle, whereas at larger
    corporations the role is typically more focused on a specific niche. While resource
    restrictions are present across all companies irrespective of size, they tend
    to be more pronounced at smaller companies and can limit one’s access to large
    datasets, compute resources, software, and career development programs. More direct
    access to senior executives is definitely a plus at smaller companies; however,
    this may come at the expense of fewer opportunities for technical mentorship due
    to fewer employees possessing the relevant expertise.
