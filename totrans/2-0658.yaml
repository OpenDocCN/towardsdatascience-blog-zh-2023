    into almost every domain, from e-commerce to autonomous driving and healthcare.
    Within each domain, data science teams are working hard to produce valuable, data-driven
    insights that can subsequently be used to make informed business decisions. The
    underlying process that governs the derivation of those insights, however, can
    vary extensively.

    confined within a narrow scope, such as data exploration, experimentation, model
    training, and data visualization. However, the role of a data scientist can be
    extremely versatile, depending on the size of the organization.

    a small versus a big company by evaluating a set of criteria including tasks and
    responsibilities, impact and innovation, learning and skill development, available
    resources, mentorship opportunities, and upward mobility.

    potentially find yourself as a *jack of all trades* tasked with the building of
    the entire infrastructure that includes data collection, processing, cleaning,
    exploration, model training, deployment, monitoring, and so on. In some cases,
    responsibilities may also include the active involvement in and implementation
    of data-driven strategies for the company, such as identifying new business opportunities
    or increasing operational efficiency.

    organizations and data scientists tend to enjoy greater autonomy and project ownership.
    This, however, also comes with increased responsibility and accountability.

    I was reporting directly to the CTO of the company. This, of course, was a fantastic
    way to have my work noticed and receive credit for the successful and timely delivery
    of features. However, expectations from C-suite executives can often be quite
    high, which increases the pressure a data scientist faces when it comes to delivering
    results on a tight schedule.

    and mature data science division tends to be much more narrow and specialized.
    For instance, if you join Apple’s Siri team, you will most likely work on a niche
    area within the field of natural language processing. Likewise, joining a data
    science division that works on Microsoft Teams will likely require you to become
    an expert in areas such as noise suppression or anomaly detection.

    in the form of collaboration and domain knowledge. Larger companies often have
    more experienced and diverse teams that can provide valuable support and expertise.
    Receiving information from a broader range can help data scientists gain a more
    holistic understanding of the underlying business, which not only provides a great
    learning opportunity, but also helps with the identification of data-driven solutions
    that can help solve inefficiencies within the company.

- en: In smaller companies, data scientists often have a more noticeable impact on
    the overall success of the business since their work can directly affect decision-making
    and strategy. However, due to the lack of readily available resources such as
    compute power or domain knowledge, data scientists may have to work more creatively
    and efficiently to produce impactful solutions, thus requiring them to display
    greater versatility and adaptability.

- en: A considerable advantage of smaller companies is a faster decision-making process.
    If you have a new and innovative idea, obtaining approval from leadership to implement
    and execute it tends to happen much faster due to a much smaller organizational
    hierarchy.

    on business outcomes due to the scale and complexity of the organization. However,
    they may have access to more resources and infrastructure to store, process, and
    analyze data, which can enable them to tackle more complex and ambitious projects.
    Additionally, the increased domain knowledge and expertise found in big companies
    can create more opportunities for collaboration and innovation, enabling data
    scientists to work alongside other experts to develop state-of-the-art solutions.

    set of skills. This exposure to various aspects of the data science cycle further
    enables them to determine which areas particularly resonate with them, which in
    turn can be leveraged to make a more informed decision on their next career step.

    scientists at larger companies may limit the breadth of skills they develop, but
    lead to considerable in-depth knowledge and expertise in their area of focus.
    They may also benefit from greater company resources such as specialized training
    programs or the free use of online learning platforms such as LinkedIn Learning,
    Coursera, or Pluralsight. Within Microsoft, for instance, we also have a biannual,
    internal conference called MLADS (Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science) in which
    the state-of-the-art is shared across a wide range of disciplines.

- en: While resource restrictions are usually in place at companies across all sizes,
    they tend to be more pronounced in small organizations. These restrictions can
    range from smaller datasets, limited compute power, fewer specialized tools and
    software to fewer opportunities to learn and grow, characterized by limited funding
    for training programs, academic conferences, and fewer sources for domain knowledge
    within the company. This makes it more challenging for data scientists to conduct
    large-scale analyses and tackle complex projects that require a large amount of
    domain expertise, data, and compute power.

- en: For instance, during my startup tenure, we only had two GPUs at our disposal,
    which significantly limited our models’ capacity, increased their training time,
    and restricted us from conducting experiments at scale. As a result, we had to
    allocate considerable time and effort to finding more efficient solutions and,
    at times, delay the initial date of the feature delivery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The opposite is generally true for larger companies. They often provide their
    data scientists with access to large datasets, more compute power, and a wide
    range of tools and software that enables them to implement a solution in a variety
    of different ways. Efficiency still matters as it can reduce latency and bring
    about cost savings; however, compared to small companies, it is often not a primary
    concern. In addition, larger companies tend to have more funding for learning
    and career growth through internal training programs, bootcamps, online learning
    resources, or academic conferences.

- en: Due to the limited number of data scientists and senior employees at smaller
    companies, they may not always provide the opportunity for mentorship, particularly
    of technical nature. For instance, the data science division I worked in during
    my startup stint consisted of only three people, which meant that in order to
    retrieve technical information, we had to consult the scientific literature and
    figure out a way to translate novel methodologies from papers to code. On the
    upside, however, you may find yourself having more direct access to senior executives
    or even founders, who could still provide you with valuable and potentially more
    high-level advice with respect to business operations and strategies.

    that pair data scientists to experienced mentors and enable them to receive guidance
    on technical skill development, career growth, and leadership. At Microsoft, for
    instance, employees are offered a variety of such mentorship programs that are
    extremely well received. I have been receiving active mentorship myself and it
    has been an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing me to not only get help
    on technical issues but also learn more about navigating the career landscape
    of a data scientist and have stimulating discussions about the latest trends in
    the field.

    senior positions and the maturity of the data science division. If the latter
    is still in its infancy, it may increase the likelihood of being assigned to a
    senior position more quickly with the right skills and experience. This way, one
    has more opportunities to take on greater project ownership and responsibilities,
    which can have a direct impact on shaping the direction of the company.

    data scientists in which they outline the specific criteria that need to be met
    in order to advance to the next level. While they may offer a wider range of opportunities
    to specialize in specific areas within the data sciences or to take on more responsibilities,
    the hierarchical structure of larger corporations can make it more challenging
    to have a significant impact on the direction of the company, and promotions may
    be more dependent on meeting some predefined criteria rather than taking on a
    wider range of responsibilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have seen that smaller organizations typically require data scientists to
    have a basic understanding of the entire data science cycle, whereas at larger
    corporations the role is typically more focused on a specific niche. While resource
    restrictions are present across all companies irrespective of size, they tend
    to be more pronounced at smaller companies and can limit one’s access to large
    datasets, compute resources, software, and career development programs. More direct
    access to senior executives is definitely a plus at smaller companies; however,
    this may come at the expense of fewer opportunities for technical mentorship due
    to fewer employees possessing the relevant expertise.
