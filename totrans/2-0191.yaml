    life. It was a passenger ferry from Dover, England to Calais, France. I didn’t
    know it then, but I was catching the tail end of the golden era of Channel crossings
    by ferry. This was right before budget airlines and the Channel Tunnel [almost
    kiboshed](https://journals.openedition.org/rhcf/2452) what I still think is the
    best way to make that journey.

    books. Instead, what I came upon was an impossibly large, gleaming white skyscraper
    with small square windows. And the skyscraper appeared to be resting on its side
    for some baffling reason. From my viewing angle on the dock, I couldn’t see the
    ship’s hull and funnels. All I saw was its long, flat, windowed, exterior. I was
    looking at a horizontal skyscraper.

    My brain had computed the **expected shape of a ferry** from the data sample of
    boat pictures I had seen. But my sample was hopelessly unrepresentative of the
    population which made the sample mean equally unrepresentative of the population
    mean. I was trying to decode reality using a heavily biased sample mean.

    when you get seasick you should go out onto the deck, take in the fresh, cool,
    sea breeze and stare at the horizon. The only thing that really works for me is
    to sit down, close my eyes, and sip my favorite soda until my thoughts drift slowly

    In seconds, that corresponds to 2302128000 (about 2.3 billion). Suppose an average
    individual experiences seasickness for 16 hours in their lifetime which is 28800
    seconds. Now let’s not quibble about the 16 hours. It is a wild guess, remember?
    So, 28800 seconds gives us a working estimate of (1 — p) of 28000/2302128000 =
    0.0000121626 and p=(1 —0.0000121626) = 0.9999878374\. So during any second of

    the probabilities p and (1 — p) which are the **population** level values of probability.
    These are the ‘true’ probabilities that you will observe should you have access
    to the entire population of values, which is practically never. Statisticians
    use the word ‘**asymptotic**’ while referring to these and similar measures. They
    are referred to as asymptotic because their meaning is significant only when something,
    such as the sample size, approaches infinity or the size of the entire population.
    Now here’s the thing:I think people just like to say ‘asymptotic’. And I also
    think it’s a convenient cover for the troublesome truth that you can never measure
    the exact value of anything.

    is ‘the great leveler’ in the field of statistical science. Whether you are a
    freshly minted graduate or a Nobel laureate in Economics, that door to the ‘population’
    remains firmly closed for you. As a statistician, you are relegated to working
    with the sample whose shortcomings you must suffer in silence. But it’s really
    not as bad a state of affairs as it sounds. Imagine what will happen if you started
    to know the exact values of things. If you had access to the population. If you
    can calculate the mean, the median, and the variance with bullseye accuracy. If
    you can foretell the future with pinpoint precision. There will be little need
    to estimate anything. Great big branches of statistics will cease to exist. The
    world will need hundreds of thousands *fewer* statisticians, not to mention data
    scientists. Imagine the impact on unemployment, on the world economy, on world

    you can’t use the actual population values of p and (1 — p). Instead, you must
    make do with **estimates** of p and (1 — p). These estimates, you will calculate
    using not the entire population — no chance of doing that. Instead, you will,
    more often than not, calculate them using a modest sized data sample. And so with
    much regret I must inform you that the best you can do is get an **estimate of
    the expected value** of the random variable **X**. Following convention, we denote
    the estimate of p as p_hat (p with a little cap or hat on it) and we denote the
    estimated expected value as E_cap(**X**).

- en: As the variance s of the sample increases, the value of the lower bound (μ_low)
    decreases, while that of the upper bound (μ_high) increases. This effectively
    moves μ_low and μ_high further apart from each other and away from the sample
    mean. Conversely, as the sample variance reduces, μ_low moves closer to **Z**_bar
    from below, and μ_high moves closer to **Z**_bar from above. The interval bounds
    essentially converge on the sample mean from both sides. In effect, the interval
    [μ_low, μ_high] is directly proportional to the sample variance. If the sample
    is widely ( or tightly) dispersed around its mean, the greater ( or lesser) dispersion
    reduces ( or increases) the reliability of the sample mean as an estimate of the
    population mean.

    从下方更接近**Z**_bar，μ_high 从上方更接近**Z**_bar。区间界限本质上从两侧趋向于样本均值。实际上，区间 [μ_low, μ_high]

    for computing expected values exists at a scale that is too small for the human

    The wave function is denoted as Ψ(x, y, z, t) in Cartesian coordinates or as Ψ(r,
    θ, ɸ, t) in polar coordinates. It’s used to describe the properties of seriously
    tiny things that enjoy living in really, really cramped spaces, like electrons
    in an atom. The wave function Ψ returns a complex number of the form A + jB, where
    A represents the real part and B represents the imaginary part. We can interpret
    the square of the absolute value of Ψ as a **joint probability density function**
    defined over the 4-dimensional space described by the tuple (x, y, z, t) or (r,
    θ, ɸ, t). Specifically for an electron in a Hydrogen atom, we can interpret |Ψ|²
    as the approximate probability of finding the electron in an infinitesimally tiny
    volume of space around (x, y, z) or around (r, θ, ɸ) at time t. By knowing |Ψ|²,
    we can run a quadruple integral over x, y, z, and t to calculate the **expected
    location of the electron** along the X, Y, or Z axis (or their polar equivalents)
    at time t.

  zh: 一个著名的例子展示了用于计算期望值的多重积分方法，其规模小到人眼无法感知。我指的是**量子力学**中的**波函数**。波函数在笛卡尔坐标中表示为Ψ(x,
    y, z, t)，在极坐标中表示为Ψ(r, θ, ɸ, t)。它用于描述那些喜欢待在极其狭小空间里的微小物体的性质，例如原子中的电子。波函数Ψ返回一个形式为A
    + jB的复数，其中A代表实部，B代表虚部。我们可以将Ψ的绝对值平方解释为定义在四维空间（x, y, z, t）或（r, θ, ɸ, t）上的**联合概率密度函数**。特别是对于氢原子中的电子，我们可以将|Ψ|²解释为在时间t时电子在（x,
    y, z）或（r, θ, ɸ）周围一个极其微小的空间体积中的大致概率。通过知道|Ψ|²，我们可以在x, y, z和t上进行四重积分，以计算电子在时间t沿X、Y或Z轴（或其极坐标等效轴）的**期望位置**。

- en: I began this article with my experience with seasickness. And I wouldn’t blame
    you if you winced at the brash use of a Bernoulli random variable to model what
    is a remarkably complex and somewhat poorly understood human ordeal. My objective
    was to illustrate how expectation affects us, literally, at a biological level.
    One way to explain that ordeal was to use the cool and comforting language of
    random variables.

  zh: 我以自己对晕船的经历开始这篇文章。如果你对用伯努利随机变量来建模这一非常复杂且尚未完全理解的人类困境感到不满，我也不会怪你。我的目的是说明期望如何从生物学层面实际影响我们。一种解释这一困境的方法是使用随机变量的酷炫且舒缓的语言。
- en: Starting with the deceptively simple Bernoulli variable, we swept our illustrative
    brush across the statistical canvas all the way to the magnificent, multi-dimensional
    complexity of the quantum wave function. Throughout, we sought to understand how
    expectation operates on discrete and continuous scales, in single and multiple
    dimensions, and at microscopic scales.

  zh: 从看似简单的伯努利变量开始，我们将我们的插图画笔从统计画布扫到量子波函数的宏伟多维复杂性。在整个过程中，我们力求理解期望如何在离散和连续尺度、单维和多维、以及微观尺度上运作。
- en: There is one more area in which expectation makes an immense impact. That area
    is **conditional probability** in which one calculates the probability that a
    random variable **X** will take a value ‘x’ assuming that certain other random
    variables **A**, **B**, **C**, etc. have already taken values ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’. The
    **probability of X conditioned upon A**, **B**, and **C** is denoted as P(**X**=x|**A**=a,**B**=b,**C**=c)
    or simply as P(**X**|**A**,**B**,**C**). In all the formulae for expectation that
    we have seen, if you replace the probability (or probability density) with the
    conditional version of the same, what you’ll get are the corresponding formulae
    for **conditional expectation**. It’s denoted as E(**X**=x|**A**=a,**B**=b,**C**=c)
    and it lies at the heart of the extensive fields of regression analysis and estimation.
    And that’s fodder for future articles!

  zh: 还有一个领域，期望发挥了巨大的影响。这个领域是**条件概率**，其中计算随机变量**X**取值‘x’的概率，假设某些其他随机变量**A**、**B**、**C**等已经取值‘a’、‘b’、‘c’。**X**在**A**、**B**和**C**的条件下的概率表示为P(**X**=x|**A**=a,**B**=b,**C**=c)，或简写为P(**X**|**A**、**B**、**C**)。在我们见过的所有期望公式中，如果将概率（或概率密度）替换为同一条件版本，得到的就是**条件期望**的相应公式。它表示为E(**X**=x|**A**=a,**B**=b,**C**=c)，它位于回归分析和估计的广泛领域的核心。这是未来文章的素材！
