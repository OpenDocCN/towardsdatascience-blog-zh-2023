    on the entire population that he / she intends to study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Studying the whole population allows the researcher to obtain a complete understanding
    of the phenomenon under study, since this allows to collect information on all
    the individuals that make up that population.
  prefs: []

    Italy. If our study needs to include responses from these individuals, it could
    be impossible to l**ocate and contact all of them due to real-world limitations.**

    Unlike the population, which represents the entire group of individuals or objects
    that you want to analyze, the sample represents only a portion of it.'
  prefs: []

    quite complex and impacts the whole research you are working on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the **population is too large** and you just can’t grab data from all of the
    individuals
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    population'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And many other aspects that depend on the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In these cases, statistical sampling becomes a practical and efficient solution
    **for estimating population characteristics**. Once data is collected from the
    sample, it can be used to make inferences about the larger population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    some characteristics with the population itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given some metric (like the height of the individuals or their scores on some
    test),
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a representative sample is one that accurately reflects the distribution of
    that metric if the whole population were to be studied instead.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the time **the researcher will have no idea how the population is distributed
    for a given metric**, so he / she could use sampling techniques, such as *random
    sampling*, which seeks to ensure that each individual in the population has an
    equal probability of being included in the sample.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it is not that simple, **since the only empirical way for the researcher
    to validate his sampling technique is through observation and experimentation.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you could use random sampling because you think that individuals
    are quite similar to one another in the population. If this were the case, experimentation
    could reveal that there are instead separate groups that differ quite largely
    from one another, which are worth studying singularly instead.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    involves **randomly selecting individuals from the population, such that each
    individual has an equal chance of being included in the sample.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**This sampling technique is useful when the population is homogeneous and
    there is no reason to divide it into groups**. Furthermore, simple random sampling
    is relatively easy to implement and requires no specialized knowledge.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, simple random sampling has some limitations, such as the **difficulty
    of ensuring representativeness of the sample when the population is highly heterogeneous**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and correctly deal with these phenomena.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stratified sampling is a sampling technique that **involves dividing the population
    into homogeneous groups, called strata, based on one or more characteristics.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the strata are defined, a simple random sample is selected within each
    stratum.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technique is useful when the population has heterogeneity in the characteristics
    of interest and you want to ensure that each stratum is adequately represented
    in the sample.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    different regions, you could divide the population by region and select a simple
    random sample of customers from each region.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systematic sampling
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systematic sampling is a sampling method in which population items are arranged
    in an ordered list and one item is selected every *k* items (for example, every
    tenth item) starting from a random starting point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sampling method is used when the list of population items is already available
    and a random selection of a sample is required.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systematic sampling is useful when the population is large and identifying each
    individual would require too much time or resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, systematic sampling can be biased if the range among the individuals
    chosen coincides with a particular pattern in the population.

- en: Quota-based sampling
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quota sampling is a non-probability sampling method in which individuals are
    selected in order **to obtain a proportional representation of the characteristics
    of the reference population.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this method, the population is divided into categories or “quotas” based
    on some characteristics of interest (for example, gender, age, education, geographic
    region) and the number of individuals to be selected for each quota is determined
    based on the proportions of the population.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The selection of subjects within each quota can be done using a random or non-random
    sampling method, depending on the needs of the study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of quota-based sampling is that it allows to obtain a sample that
    proportionally represents the characteristics of the reference population, even
    if the choice of subjects within each quota is not made randomly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sampling method is often used in **opinion polls,** as it allows a representative
    sample to be reached relatively quickly and cheaply. However, quota sampling may
    be influenced by the knowledge and opinions of the recruiter who selects subjects
    for the sample, and may therefore be subject to selection bias.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bootstrapping is a resampling technique **that allows to approximate the population
    by randomly selecting with substitution a certain number of elements from the
    population to generate a sample.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This process is repeated many times, so as to create a large amount of samples.
    From these samples any statistic (such as the mean or the median) is extracted
    and this becomes part of the final sample which will approximate the population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bootstrapping is useful when you want to estimate the accuracy of a sample statistic
    or machine learning model. **Instead of making assumptions about the population
    distribution, bootstrapping uses the distribution of the synthetic samples to
    estimate the standard error and confidence intervals**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bootstrapping is especially useful when the population distribution is unknown
    or when it is not possible to obtain repeated samples from the original population.
