- en: Considerable emphasis is given to the analytical methods and algorithms used
    in data science projects, extracting meaningful insights from data and discovering
    valuable information. But equally as important (arguably even more important)
    is the data preparation prior to beginning a project; the quality of the data
    is the bedrock on which any data analysis or machine learning project is based
    on. It would be naive to expect quality outputs from an analysis with subpar data
    inputs — garbage in garbage out, as the saying goes. Therefore it’s essential
    to ensure that the data samples collected are of sufficient quality. But how to
    choose the appropriate sampling technique for your data?

- en: Simple random sampling (SRS) does exactly what the name would suggest— the sample
    is selected from the population at random, irrespective of other considerations
    such as population characteristics. This is generally effective when the population
    is considered to be relatively homogeneous, i.e. each element in the population
    is expected to be alike to the others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage to this is that due to its randomness, it’s difficult to introduce
    biases in the data — a large enough sample size would theoretically be representative
    of the overall population, which is ideal if the end goal is to model general
    population behaviours. There are some drawbacks to this approach — namely, that
    smaller subgroups within the whole may be underrepresented in the data. In cases
    like this the simple random sample may be unsuitable for purpose.

    on public health — a statistician may approach this task by first getting a list
    of all town residents, assigning a number to each person, then using a random
    number generator to select a sample of residents for the survey. However, if this
    poll is particularly interested in the health of the elderly population of the
    town (i.e. over 90 years old) then this method may exclude that small subpopulation
    entirely — meaning that SRS should then be discarded as a viable option for the
    needs of such a survey.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By comparison, stratified sampling addresses the potential underrepresentation
    issues of SRS directly, by first dividing the population into distinct subgroups
    (or strata) based on their characteristics — returning to the example of the town
    health survey, these strata may be grouped by age group, or further subdivided
    by gender or income. Following this, random samples are taken from each subgroup
    (stratum) to build the sample population for analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a practical approach for when you want to ensure adequate representation
    from each subgroup. Depending on the needs of the survey, a statistician may either
    take an equal number of individuals from each stratum, or select a number of individuals
    based on their proportion to the total population — in this way a survey-taker
    can maintain proportional representation in their survey. With this in mind, it
    may be difficult to sort the population into clearly defined strata — making the
    task of creating a stratified sample more complex than a simple random sample.

- en: With cluster sampling the population is initially grouped into clusters, then
    clusters are randomly selected for the sample. In this context cluster sampling
    has similarities with stratified sampling, in that the population is first segmented
    before subgroups are chosen at random. However as opposed to randomly selecting
    individuals from each subgroup, it is the subgroups which are randomly selected
    instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cluster groupings are typically based on factors such as proximity, with the
    central guideline being that each cluster must be distinct from the others. Returning
    to the town health survey as an analogy, clusters may be based on neighbourhoods
    or even houses, where some or all of the household is added to the sample. Another
    example of this would be in a production environment, where entire batches of
    product are chosen at random for sampling rather than selecting individual units
    from each batch. This has the benefit of being more convenient than scraping through
    all units in the assembly line. One thing to be careful with is ensuring that
    all clusters are independent of each other, so that each element belongs to one
    cluster only — otherwise this may result in potential sampling errors.

- en: As well as this, cluster sampling may introduce biases due to a clustering effect
    — elements within each cluster are correlated which may lead to larger standard
    errors and reduced precision compared against SRS. There are methods to adjust
    for these errors, but this adds complexity to the sampling process.

- en: Lastly, systematic sampling involves selecting a starting point within the population
    and then regularly choosing every nth item to add to the sample size — this is
    particularly convenient for large population sizes where a list is available.
    An example of this is on the production line for post-processing measurements
    from a machine, where every 10th product running through the tool is measured
    for defects. In this example, 10% of the total population is added to the sample
    size, to ensure quality control from the machine’s processing.

- en: The benefits to this approach include simplicity and efficiency of data gathering,
    while maintaining a uniform coverage of the population. Unfortunately this method
    is sensitive to element ordering — if there’s a repeating pattern appearing cyclically
    in the population, this may also introduce bias in the sample.

    be other factors to consider — but generally this approach works for the large
    majority of cases. Ultimately the question comes down to what data is important
    in the data collection process, whether potential biases are addressed, and any
    potential limitations on data gathering. The optimal sampling technique will sufficiently
    address these concerns — so long as you bear this in mind when choosing your sampling
    method, you can be confident in obtaining high quality data for your purposes.
