- en: Correlation… Who has not heard about correlation? We use this term so often
    and yet we don’t know too much about it. When you say, “These two things are correlated,”
    what do you actually mean? Or what do you mean when you say that the correlation
    between two things is strong?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For data scientists and statisticians, correlation is even more important than
    it is for others. This is because we are those who work with data, so we are responsible
    for understanding any phenomena that happen in them — and explaining them to business
    colleagues or fellow researchers or whoever we’re working with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve happened to find myself in such a situation a hundred times, if not more.
    From my experience it follows that despite correlation being a simple concept,
    explaining it to others is disproportionately difficult. Why? Because most educated
    people have some sort of understanding of this concept — and more often than not,
    they are surprisingly attached to this understanding. Therefore, we often have
    to break through this wall first, and only then will we be able to explain what
    a given relationship means.

    we consider small/medium/large strength of association; other guidelines may use
    weak/medium/strong association/correlation; still others can use something similar.
    But basically, such guidelines offer some intervals for the correlation coefficient
    that can be used to decide how strong the corresponding association is.

    strength, just like that of `0.99`. But the correlation of `0.49` is, unlike that
    of `0.51`, weak… I know, these are just numbers, so let me show some data. On
    the graph below, you can see three pairs of variables `x` and `y`, all the three

    population of people on the globe *based on two big samples* (two different correlations,
    two different samples). The correlation between identical twins’ height should
    be close to `1.0`, and that of, say, `0.5` would be amazingly weak and should
    not happen. On the other hand, the correlation between pairs of independent people
    should be close to `0.0`, and that of `0.5` would be amazingly strong and should
    not happen.

    coefficient between two variables representing a person’s height, `0.5`, for two
    different situations — and it occurred that in one of them this value was *amazingly
    weak* while in the other one it was *amazingly strong*. The same value of `0.5`
    should not happen in these two situations. In one situation, it should not happen
    because it would mean a far-too-weak correlation. In the other it should not happen
    because it would mean a far-too-strong correlation.

    you should expect; and think how far the estimate you got is from this expected
    correlation. If it’s much smaller, the association is likely weak. If it’s much
    bigger, it’s likely strong. When it’s similar, it’s likely *expected*.

    much bigger, it’s likely strong.” I did this because when you obtain such unexpected
    results, first of all you should check how the sample was collected. Correlation
    coefficient is sensitive to sample size. Too small a sample can lead to inaccurate
    estimates. Thus, don’t get too attached to the correlation coefficient estimated
    from a small sample. Such an estimate may turn out to be very far from the real
    (population) one. I wouldn’t expect this to happen when you draw a big sample
    while in the case of a small sample, it’s not only probable — it’s likely. I feel
    like writing a longer article about the meaning of sample size in correlation,
    so expect one in the future.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    as linear while it does not have to be such. Maybe you obtained an unexpectedly
    small value of the coefficient of linear correlation because the association was
    not linear? This is yet another thing to check, but it’s a different story…
