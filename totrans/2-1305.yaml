- en: Like many, I’ve found myself enthralled with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and have used
    it for a wide variety of activities. From serious tasks like debugging code, to
    creative applications like writing poetry and short stories, it’s been fun to
    explore what ChatGPT can do. At the same time, it’s also been enlightening to
    look at its shortcomings. Being a language model, it cannot generate direct images
    like Midjourney AI or DALL-E can, as it was not trained on a large body of images,
    but rather text. However, when you consider that mathematically speaking, images
    are just 2D (or 3D in the case of colored images, i.e., RGB) arrays, you could
    have it write code to generate images. Thus, I asked ChatGPT to generate arrays
    corresponding to images.

    object that gives the illusion of a 3D sphere. I then gave it some additional
    instructions, noting that it should have black lines running through it (though
    in hindsight, I probably should have specified black “curves” instead).

- en: In summary, ChatGPT has the capability to generate arrays corresponding to meaningful
    images using the `numpy` library in Python, but with limitations. Despite the
    lack of training data, ChatGPT is still able to produce simple images such as
    a smiley face. However, it struggles to generate more complex images like a basketball
    and requires multiple iterations to produce code for a smiley face. With further
    development, it’s possible that ChatGPT could generate basic images with less
    assistance. In the near future, we could see a combination of ChatGPT and an AI
    image generator. In my next article, I’ll discuss how ChatGPT can be utilized
    to provide prompts for AI image generators.
