    Cup. A total of 32 national teams competed, with Spain taking home the trophy
    for the first time. Major sporting events always generate a lot of data, and I
    took this as an opportunity to learn how to use Plotly.

- en: Historically, women were banned from playing soccer in many countries. The German
    Football Association (DFB) decided in 1955 that “the lack of elegance could damage
    the delicate body and soul of women and would be an attack on morals and society”.
    It was not until 1970 that the ban was lifted. Today, women play soccer around
    the world, with restrictions remaining in only a few countries.

- en: Our first data story shows the participation of national women’s soccer teams
    in the World Cup as a bar chart. Since the first edition in 1991, the tournament
    has been held nine times. Nations from every continent have participated. Some
    have participated in every World Cup, while others have participated only once.
    I was surprised to see that North Korea participated four times!

    We show the age of the national players in box plots. The color code refers to
    the team’s ranking in the tournament. As far as I can see, there is no clear pattern
    — teams with all kinds of median ages have similar chances to reach the knockout
    phase of the tournament. Haiti and Zambia stand out with very young squads.

    play when they are not part of their national team. We aggregate the number of
    players per club and show only the Top 30\. Well-known European and British clubs
    such as Barcelona, Chelsea, PSG, and Arsenal dominate the list. The top Asian
    clubs are Incheon Hyundai Steel and Wuhan Jianghan University, which are associated
    with a large number of players from their respective countries.

    represented. World Cup winner Spain also attracts many top players.

- en: Finally, let’s take a look at whether it pays to enter and win a World Cup tournament.
    I was surprised to see that until the 2007 Women’s World Cup, no prize money was
    paid out at all. In the 2023 Australia/New Zealand tournament, there was a total
    of $100 million US-$ available to be paid out. Compared to the $1 billion US-$
    distributed in Qatar during the 2022 Men’s World Cup, this number is still comparatively
    low. If we plot both curves on a logarithmic scale, we can see that the growth
    rate of the women’s prize money appears to be outpacing the growth rate of the
    men’s prize money. So at some point in the future, there may be equal pay.

    years of their tournament cannot be shown on this scale.

    statistical plots are available. It will take me some time to get used to the
    plot customization, which is a little different from what I am used to in matplotlib.
    The interactive features are great for exploring data, and readers are encouraged
    to download the full notebook and play around with it. For the purposes of a blog
    post, I found it challenging to embed interactive plots, so I resorted to static
    plots.
