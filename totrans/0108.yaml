  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I discovered Prukalpa via one of her articles, [Data Governance branding problem](/data-governance-has-a-serious-branding-problem-7925b909712b).
    It resonated at the time because I was in the middle of one of the most complex
    governance implementations. The words helped soothe some pain that I am not in
    this alone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since Prukalpa is a co-founder of Atlan, she could write about her business;
    however, she chooses to focus her articles on Data Management as an industry,
    which helps provide more context. She also has a substack newsletter called [Metadata
    Weekly](https://metadataweekly.substack.com/).

    Data Quality (DQ) and why it costs so much. Organisations like to fix tactically,
    build technical debt and complain about DQ when it's too late.

    and continue to write about their challenges, which also resonates with an average

    a team to contribute collectively. Once the fancy title wears off, the realisation
    sets in; this is a lot of work. I turned to this book by Julie Zhou, which helped

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was initially skeptical about this; we've all learnt that "enjoy the work
    you do, and you don't work a day in your life." However, this book changed my
    perspective, and I could relate to it. It advocates that as you hone your craft,
    you will build enough career capital so that you can control your work & life.

    even know such a thing existed. Over the years of getting good at this craft,
    I have much more autonomy, competence and relatedness, the three things required
    to be [happy in anything.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory)

- en: I don't know how else to place Naval, but his philosophical tweets and this
    book is a culmination of those tweets are incredible. Naval advocates for "specific
    knowledge," which you can't be trained for. If you can be trained, so can others.

- en: At the breakfast session, I mentioned this to a few technical team members,
    you can learn many technical skills via courses and videos, but the soft skills
    only come with the application. And if you can marry them both, you become unstoppable.

- en: When Naval says "specific knowledge" in the data world, it means bringing soft
    and hard skills together. Tailoring communication with different audiences, technical
    & business, can amount to "specific knowledge". You can't be trained for it; you
    must apply, iterate and learn it.

    using them for those tasks. Using an Engineer to fix a data pipeline rather than
    create executive-level status updates as an example.

    specific knowledge that only you are known for, build your brand around this specific
    knowledge and then ask for more autonomy. Freedom of projects you work on, the
    teams you work with, the clients you work for etc.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Naval says "long-term" people, he means your engineering, business, infrastructure,
    and governance teams for a data analyst. The people you work with today will climb
    the career ladder in 10 years. Delivering using your specific knowledge to them
    now will allow you to build long-term relationships with them.
