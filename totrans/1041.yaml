    in some cases, they are used interchangeably. You may be a mid, senior or experienced
    AI practitioner and have seen it all (from a technical perspective). You've probably
    worked within different teams with various structural configurations of Data Engineers,
    Scientists, and Product Managers. You understand the critical processes in a machine
    learning pipeline, including productionising AI models.
