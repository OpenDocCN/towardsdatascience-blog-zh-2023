    AI, many questions arose related to the impact on the job market related to AI.

    less workforce”. No industry seems spared. No function seems spared.

    or smaller, like this French PR company [replacing half of its staff by AI](https://www.ouest-france.fr/high-tech/intelligence-artificielle/cette-entreprise-francaise-vire-217-salaries-pour-les-remplacer-par-une-intelligence-artificielle-1dea7af2-560d-11ee-ba56-a7ce59b686ce).

    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/)

    it stated, quote, “*Produce a report on AI’s* ***potential labor-market impacts****,

    which accounted for 10 lines. This can be discussed, but all the 10 shutdowns
    were not AI related, but rather companies going bankrupt due to various reasons
    (market correction, non-viable business model …).

    This cut comes after another one that was announced earlier this year, to cut
    [716 jobs](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/08/linkedin-layoffs/). LinkedIn is looking
    at AI to automate routine tasks, integrate new AI-powered tools, but also to offer
    new features using Generative AI, like [LinkedIn Collaborative Articles](https://medium.com/illumination/how-i-got-my-linkedin-top-voice-badge-6757142c9f73),
    which are AI generated articles that seem to drive a lot of traffic according
    to LinkedIn. The job cuts impacted particularly the R&D department.

    with Generative AI, indicating a strategic shift towards leveraging artificial
    intelligence for efficiency, seeking profitability, and possibly to improve the
    quality of services provided on their platform. It is also worth mentioning that
    Stack Overflow initially adopted a ban on AI technologies, just to come back to
    a more balanced position, and understand the real impact AI is having. More simply,
    Stack Overflow business, as Knowledge Management tool is directly impacted (if
    not, disrupted) by the competition implied by AI adoption.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the cases of LinkedIn and Stack Overflow, AI and automation significantly
    impacted workforce structures. These moves by LinkedIn and Stack Overflow seem
    to be in line with the broader trend in the tech industry where AI and automation
    are replacing traditional jobs, especially amidst a boom in AI technology. Yet
    this trend is not that massive. **In this study it only impacted 2 over 65 layoffs**
    (3% in number of layoffs; ~7% in terms of number of employees impacted).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reasons for the rest of the layoffs (63 over 65) encompass various
    factors including efforts to achieve profitability, restructuring, financial struggles,
    and the impact of acquisitions. Economic downturns, shifts in business strategies,
    and changes in market dynamics also contributed to these layoffs. Also, some are
    related to industry-specific situation, like the self-correction of the Crypto
    market after an overhype situation and “back to earth” journey.

    It impacted 2 layoffs over 65, LinkedIn and Stack Overflow. This does not show
    a massive movement on the market.

    their background or resources, has equal access to the ongoing technological advancements
    and can fully benefit from them. This is instrumental in ensuring everyone “lands”
    smoothly and can adapt to those changes.

    leading to more layoffs. **However, it also opens doors for upskilling and new
    roles centered around AI and Data Science**. The job offerings related to AI skills
    have [grown by 75% over the past four years](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/top-7-ai-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2023-and-2024-805a99e64227).
    Also, companies might need to balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and
    retaining a motivated workforce by retraining employees for evolving roles.
