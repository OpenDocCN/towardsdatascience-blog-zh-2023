- en: Data analysis has become an integral part of various industries, as it enables
    us to make informed decisions based on collected data. One of the most popular
    libraries for data analysis in Python is Pandas, which provides powerful data
    manipulation and cleaning tools. However, working with Pandas can sometimes feel
    overwhelming, especially for those who are new to data analysis or prefer a more
    visual approach. This is where PandasGUI steps in — a library that brings a graphical
    user interface to Pandas, making data manipulation and visualization more accessible
    and user-friendly.

    you through the installation process and showcasing its capabilities.

    that the operating system will have an environment variable `APPDATA`. However,
    it is not the case for other operating systems such as Mac or Linux. Specifically,
    when we try to import the PandasGUI, it will show up this error.

    you may be familiar with the Iris dataset that is used in many classification
    or clustering machine learning demos.

    and publishing high-quality open data sets from a variety of sources. Most of
    the datasets here are open-sourced and can be used for learning purposes according
    to the license, including the Iris dataset.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first feature I want to introduce is filtering. It relies on the DataFrame
    query expressions to quickly filter the dataframe for us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically, we just need to type the queries such as `sepallength > 7` and
    press enter. The filter will be applied to the dataframe. We can review the filtered
    results in the main area.

    the checkboxes. For example, the screenshot below shows two checked expressions
    that both are applied to filter the dataframe.

    Excel, such as sorting and colour coding. Apart from that, we can also easily
    cast the type of column.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have to say that Python is one of the easiest languages when we want to plot
    a graph using code. However, we have to write some code after all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In PandasGUI, we can plot the dataframe using its columns in seconds. For example,
    the demo below shows that I just need to switch to the “Grapher” tab and select
    “Scatter 3D”. Then, drag some columns to the axis fields.

    This actually allows us to quickly test different types of graphs and decide which
    one could tell a better data story.

- en: 2.5 Reshaping the Dataframe
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also use PandasGUI to reshape a dataframe with drag and drop. For example,
    we can pivot the Iris dataframe by converting its “class” into columns and then
    calculate the average of each attribute such as the petal length.

    generated as follows.

- en: 2.6 Generating Code
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For most of the features about, PandasGUI can also generate the code for us.
    This could be very useful when we use the GUI to decide which type of graph is
    the best, and then easily generate the code to put it into our real script.

    allows us to experiment with reshaping many times and then output the right code.

    library that brings a graphical user interface to the widely-used Pandas library
    for data manipulation and visualization. We have demonstrated the installation
    process, loading a sample dataset, and explored features like filtering, sorting,
    statistical analysis, plotting, reshaping, and code generation.

- en: PandasGUI is a valuable tool that can significantly enhance your data analysis
    workflow by simplifying common tasks and offering an interactive experience. While
    it greatly facilitates data manipulation for both beginners and experienced data
    scientists, it is important to note that it may not support extremely complex
    operations. For advanced manipulations, one might need to rely on traditional
    Pandas scripting.
