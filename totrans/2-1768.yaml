    intelligence levels. The smartest one’s name is MaoMao. Recently, I noticed MaoMao
    has picked up a new habit. Whenever I am eating lunch, he sits next to me. I’d
    like to believe he loves me and wants to spend time with me, but his aloof personality
    suggests otherwise. I also notice he is alert when sitting next to me, constantly
    looking for something. After some observations, I realize he is waiting for a
    sunlight reflection to chase. You know how cats are crazy about lasers, light
    reflections, etc. The dining table receives full sunlight at noon, and sometimes,
    the reflection of my watch appears on nearby walls or ceilings.

    a light to chase. My other two cats haven’t figured out this pattern yet but have
    their own strategy. Whenever they hear the noises made by MaoMao chasing the light,
    they know the light has come and will soon join the chase. I watch them play every
    time when I am having lunch, the most relaxing activity recovering from busy mornings.

    research shows watching cats play or doing stupid things reduces stress levels
    significantly, that’s not the main purpose of this article. The story is just
    a way for me to bring up the importance of causality in a more understandable
    way. Moreover, I am excited to introduce my first ‘**Read with Me**’ series, where
    I invite you to read a book together with me. I hope to provide a platform for
    us to delve deeper into our common interests and share our learnings. The book
    I'd like to start with is ['The Book of Why' by Judea Pearl](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X),
    which “revolutionized the understanding of causality.”

    work but also because I believe it to be true science. You probably heard about
    ‘**correlation is not causality**’ a lot. However, the real question is, why chase
    causality when correlation can already do much for us? That’s where the cat story
    comes in handy.

    believe it or not, he has a forecasting model in his mind. The model is whenever
    I am sitting at the dining table, the light shows up. The model can be represented
    in math equations:'

    forecasts. He is right 99% of the time whenever it’s sunny. The 1% inaccuracy
    may come from the occasions when I am not wearing my watch. My other cats, who
    follow MaoMao’s behavior, are represented by these equations:'

    forecasting models. The models learn the patterns from historical data and find
    the most predictive variables to the target variable. In my cat's mind, the two
    models are much easier than the machine learning and deep learning models developed
    by smart human beings. However, they follow the same principle with different
    levels of complexity.

    exercises around my lunchtime as long as I am wearing a watch and sitting at the
    right location in the right weather. However, on cloudy days, at dinner time when
    the sun is down, or when I am not wearing a watch, their forecasting models’ accuracies
    will all drop to 0\. Why? Because they haven’t solved the problem the right way
    by learning the causal structure:'

- en: Even though we humans can tell easily the structure is wrong, my cats are still
    staying with their forecasting models. MaoMao sits with me whenever I have a meal,
    even at night. That’s the problem of not knowing the causality when making forecasts.
    When everything stays the same, or there is no regime change, the correlation-based
    model works so well that people doubt the necessity of figuring out a causal structure.
    Then things like COVID, geopolitical frictions, and business modifications happen,
    and suddenly, the model performance drops crazily, and you are scratching your
    head about what’s happening here. In such cases, the only choice you have is to
    retrain and rebuild your models to adjust to the new regime, usually with limited
    training data available. Another scenario is worse when you resemble my other
    cats, constantly making lagged model predictions. In such cases, you are just
    reacting instead of being proactive, which is never the purpose of forecasting
    models, and you are always late.

- en: If MaoMao understood the causal relationship between the sun and my watch, causing
    light to appear on the wall, it would know exactly where to look for the light
    on a sunny day. Additionally, MaoMao would know there is no point in waiting for
    the light on a rainy day or when I am not wearing a watch. With the same principle,
    if I sit on the sofa with sunlight, the light will also appear on the opposite
    wall; if I don’t wear a watch but have a phone in my hand, the phone will also
    reflect the light on the wall. Moreover, once they figure the structure out, they
    can try to influence my behavior through their cuteness to lead me to sit in places
    with sunlight. They can unleash the full causality potential to their benefit,
    which is to play with the light. Isn’t it nice to be a cat who understands causality?

- en: Of course, our forecasting models are much more complicated than the cats’ model.
    We need to build and construct much more complicated causal structures facing
    numerous features. However, the payoff is also much more than a play date. It’s
    the million-dollar question that every company wants to know — **If I do X, will
    my sales go up? Will my customers churn less? Will my profit be higher?**

    what it is. A typical question at this layer is, “ What will happen to sales of
    dental floss if we double the price of toothpaste?” or more directly, “What’s
    the price we should set to sell the most dental floss?”

    it involves **imagination**, something manifested during the Cognitive Revolution

    of toothpaste?”

    to complex deep neural networks to LLM, human makes innovations nonstop. We have
    made a lot of progress in building predictive AI models to resemble human intelligence,
    and these models equip machines with impressive abilities. However, no intelligence
    will be achieved without embedding causality. We can create more complex models
    with multiple hidden layers and mathematical equations, but the fundamental principles
    remain similar to my cats’ simple model. It’s the same correlation-based first-rung
    solution to complicated questions.
