- en: I have three cats. I love all of them, but I have to admit they have different
    intelligence levels. The smartest one’s name is MaoMao. Recently, I noticed MaoMao
    has picked up a new habit. Whenever I am eating lunch, he sits next to me. I’d
    like to believe he loves me and wants to spend time with me, but his aloof personality
    suggests otherwise. I also notice he is alert when sitting next to me, constantly
    looking for something. After some observations, I realize he is waiting for a
    sunlight reflection to chase. You know how cats are crazy about lasers, light
    reflections, etc. The dining table receives full sunlight at noon, and sometimes,
    the reflection of my watch appears on nearby walls or ceilings.

    a light to chase. My other two cats haven’t figured out this pattern yet but have
    their own strategy. Whenever they hear the noises made by MaoMao chasing the light,
    they know the light has come and will soon join the chase. I watch them play every
    time when I am having lunch, the most relaxing activity recovering from busy mornings.

    research shows watching cats play or doing stupid things reduces stress levels
    significantly, that’s not the main purpose of this article. The story is just
    a way for me to bring up the importance of causality in a more understandable
    way. Moreover, I am excited to introduce my first ‘**Read with Me**’ series, where
    I invite you to read a book together with me. I hope to provide a platform for
    us to delve deeper into our common interests and share our learnings. The book
    I'd like to start with is ['The Book of Why' by Judea Pearl](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X),
    which “revolutionized the understanding of causality.”

    work but also because I believe it to be true science. You probably heard about
    ‘**correlation is not causality**’ a lot. However, the real question is, why chase
    causality when correlation can already do much for us? That’s where the cat story
    comes in handy.

    forecasting models. The models learn the patterns from historical data and find
    the most predictive variables to the target variable. In my cat's mind, the two
    models are much easier than the machine learning and deep learning models developed
    by smart human beings. However, they follow the same principle with different
    levels of complexity.

    exercises around my lunchtime as long as I am wearing a watch and sitting at the
    right location in the right weather. However, on cloudy days, at dinner time when
    the sun is down, or when I am not wearing a watch, their forecasting models’ accuracies
    will all drop to 0\. Why? Because they haven’t solved the problem the right way
    by learning the causal structure:'

- en: Even though we humans can tell easily the structure is wrong, my cats are still
    staying with their forecasting models. MaoMao sits with me whenever I have a meal,
    even at night. That’s the problem of not knowing the causality when making forecasts.
    When everything stays the same, or there is no regime change, the correlation-based
    model works so well that people doubt the necessity of figuring out a causal structure.
    Then things like COVID, geopolitical frictions, and business modifications happen,
    and suddenly, the model performance drops crazily, and you are scratching your
    head about what’s happening here. In such cases, the only choice you have is to
    retrain and rebuild your models to adjust to the new regime, usually with limited
    training data available. Another scenario is worse when you resemble my other
    cats, constantly making lagged model predictions. In such cases, you are just
    reacting instead of being proactive, which is never the purpose of forecasting
    models, and you are always late.

  zh: 尽管我们人类很容易判断结构是否错误，我的猫们依然坚持使用它们的预测模型。MaoMao 每当我吃饭时，无论是白天还是晚上，总是和我待在一起。这就是在做预测时不了解因果关系的问题。当一切保持不变，或者没有制度变更时，基于相关性的模型效果非常好，以至于人们怀疑搞清楚因果结构的必要性。然后，当像
    COVID、地缘政治摩擦和商业调整等事情发生时，模型表现突然大幅下降，你会摸不着头脑。在这种情况下，你唯一的选择就是重新训练和重建你的模型，以适应新的制度，通常可用的训练数据有限。另一种更糟的情况是你像我的其他猫一样，始终做出滞后的模型预测。在这种情况下，你只是被动反应，而不是主动，这从来不是预测模型的目的，而且你总是迟到。

- en: If MaoMao understood the causal relationship between the sun and my watch, causing
    light to appear on the wall, it would know exactly where to look for the light
    on a sunny day. Additionally, MaoMao would know there is no point in waiting for
    the light on a rainy day or when I am not wearing a watch. With the same principle,
    if I sit on the sofa with sunlight, the light will also appear on the opposite
    wall; if I don’t wear a watch but have a phone in my hand, the phone will also
    reflect the light on the wall. Moreover, once they figure the structure out, they
    can try to influence my behavior through their cuteness to lead me to sit in places
    with sunlight. They can unleash the full causality potential to their benefit,
    which is to play with the light. Isn’t it nice to be a cat who understands causality?

  zh: 如果 MaoMao 理解了太阳和我的手表之间的因果关系，导致光线出现在墙上，它就会知道在晴天应该去哪里寻找光线。此外，MaoMao 还会知道在雨天或我没有戴手表的时候等待光线是没有意义的。遵循相同的原则，如果我坐在有阳光的沙发上，光线也会出现在对面的墙上；如果我不戴手表但手上拿着手机，手机也会在墙上反射光线。此外，一旦它们搞清楚了结构，它们可以通过它们的可爱来影响我的行为，促使我坐在有阳光的地方。它们可以充分发挥因果关系的潜力，享受光线的乐趣。理解因果关系的猫难道不好吗？
- en: Of course, our forecasting models are much more complicated than the cats’ model.
    We need to build and construct much more complicated causal structures facing
    numerous features. However, the payoff is also much more than a play date. It’s
    the million-dollar question that every company wants to know — **If I do X, will
    my sales go up? Will my customers churn less? Will my profit be higher?**

    to complex deep neural networks to LLM, human makes innovations nonstop. We have
    made a lot of progress in building predictive AI models to resemble human intelligence,
    and these models equip machines with impressive abilities. However, no intelligence
    will be achieved without embedding causality. We can create more complex models
    with multiple hidden layers and mathematical equations, but the fundamental principles
    remain similar to my cats’ simple model. It’s the same correlation-based first-rung
    solution to complicated questions.
