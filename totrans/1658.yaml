    Well, this is a very challenging question. And, in fact, it ended up I developed
    my bachelor’s thesis on it, [creating an anomaly detection algorithm for industrial
    processes](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-use-data-science-in-industrial-production-environments-6accf24afeb2).
