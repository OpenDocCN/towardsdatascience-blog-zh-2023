    to fragmented business teams creating isolated data pipelines whenever they need
    to solve some problem. The endeavour to consolidate data pipelines under a centralised
    data team within a big data lake swiftly encountered bottlenecks, resulting in
    an overwhelming sea of data that was challenging to access, comprehend, and riddled
    with persistent data issues.
