    kind of foul, or as a way to resolve draws in games that must have a winner. During

    the shot from a designated point 12 yards from the goal line.

    It would be a probability distribution that would specify with what probability
    the keeper plays “right” with probability *p*, which would then imply that the
    other action available (“left”) is taken with probability *1-p.* Similarly, for
    the kicker, a mixed strategy would be a probability (lets call it *q*) of playing
    “right” and a probability *1-q* of playing “left”.

  prefs: []

    policing (which can be described as a cost function), while increasing punishment
    has a different (traditionally lower) cost function. As a consequence, it is the

    monitoring but increasing punishment.

    the same requirements as Nash equilibria in pure strategies.

    — pure strategy Nash equilibria are just a special case in which all players assign
    probability 1 to one strategy and 0 to all others
