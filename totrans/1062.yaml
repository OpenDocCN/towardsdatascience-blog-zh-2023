- en: Most tech workers would agree the current economic environment is not great.
    Many [companies laid off staff](https://layoffs.fyi/) earlier in the year [including
    the company I work at](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-team-update-march-2023).
    Tighter cash flow often means greater scrutiny of teams’ performance and value-add
    to the organization. So it becomes more important that you and your team can clearly
    articulate how you contribute to the business’s goals.

    create value. They include *metrics and measurement, product features, strategic
    insights,* and *operational decision products*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why these four categories? They are not entirely mutually exclusive — I expect
    some teams to occasionally straddle categories. But generally, these categories
    require distinct skill sets, produce different deliverables, and focus on specific
    problems. Knowing what label applies to your team or project can help you make
    sure you have the right skills represented to achieve your deliverable and make
    it easier to communicate what you’re doing. And maybe, you’ll realize there are
    some untapped areas in your organization.

- en: Do not underestimate the value of good metrics in a company. A data team responsible
    for metrics and measuring those metrics has a critical role in assessing how the
    business is performing. They help alert business leaders to declining performance
    which may require a pivot. They help define Key Performance Indicators so teams
    work towards the right goals. They create forecasts for planning and measuring
    performance. Essentially, they simplify the large complex nature of running a
    business into some key statistics to streamline a lot of decision-making. This
    is highly valuable work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, I’d also like to highlight that *metrics & measurement* also encompass
    experimentation, a common responsibility of many data scientists. Did a new feature
    contribute to a lift in the metrics? Did the latest marketing campaign increase
    bookings? These analyses fall under this category.

- en: A second, common area of data science is building externally-facing product
    features. These features are often powered by machine learning, although this
    is not a requirement. This work creates a service/feature or improves the user
    experience for customers. An example would be a recommendation engine on a streaming
    platform that gives TV show suggestions. The deliverable is thus a working (and
    often a key requirement is *scalable*) algorithm that can be embedded in a product
    or website.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is probably the vaguest area in terms of what is actually delivered, but
    strategic insights encompasses research or analysis to guide business decisions.
    It can leverage data analytics, statistical modeling, simulation, etc. It can
    be simple to very advanced, but the deliverable is generally a recommendation.
    How should the business proceed and why? These projects are usually executed very
    closely with business stakeholders. They tend to focus on an ad-hoc question as
    opposed to regular decisions that need to be made (see next category).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, this category focuses on tools that are built to make internal business
    decisions. How can the business operate more efficiently by making better decisions
    and/or quicker decisions? For instance, building a tool to help the marketing
    department bid on a Google keyword is a problem that could be solved by an operational
    decision product.

- en: The difference between this category and strategic insights is first, decision
    products should be a production-grade application. Second, decision products answer
    specific, repeated decision questions as opposed to one-off business questions.
    So deciding where to open a new distribution center might be a strategic insight
    question, automatically routing inventory to thousands of stores is an operational
    decision product.
  prefs: []

- en: This category is also different than the AI/ML product or product features.
    The distinction comes from how it creates value, as opposed to how these tools
    are built. An operational decision product is about bringing in more revenue or
    cutting costs through operating more efficiently or effectively. Thus, I’d put
    a pricing tool that dynamically changes prices on an e-commerce website as an
    operational decision product rather than an AI/ML product feature.

    strategic insights, or operational decision products*?* All of this work can provide
    valuable knowledge, tools, features, and direction to the business. The primary
    difference between them is how they contribute value. It’s critical to know your
    work’s value proposition and articulate that to stakeholders.

    data science can support the business. Under-utilized data science teams often
    exist when leadership doesn’t know how to use them. Layoffs can happen when teams
    aren’t perceived as essential. But if execs clearly understand how data science
    can help, then they may suddenly realize there’s a whole list of projects teams
    should tackle. Then, it’s just up to you to deliver.
