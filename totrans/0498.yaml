- en: We will not be diving deeper into the mechanics behind this technique, since
    it is outside the scope of this blog post.

    to higher sales, and if so, by how much.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or programming tools, which means that traditionally, someone without a background
    in data analytics or statistics might find it challenging to perform and interpret
    a correlation analysis.
