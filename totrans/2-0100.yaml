    but also **what you show**. In other words, effectively conveying your expertise
    and past work is a critical part of the process.

    not because of some tremendous cost or time commitment but because *I held myself
    back*. In fact, my [first portfolio](https://shawhint.github.io/) **didn’t cost
    me anything** and **took me about a weekend to create**.

    is this for? What are they looking for? How can I directly speak to their needs?*
  id: totrans-25

- en: For example, if looking for entry-level data science roles, pick projects that
    convey technical data skills (e.g. Python and SQL), and don’t pick projects more
    suitable for software engineering or web development (e.g., javascript, HTML,
    etc). While the latter may be helpful in a data science role, they are not critical
    and are ultimately a distraction to your audience.

    a big fish in a small pond and helps avoid the “I specialize in everything” pitch.

    you fit into their world. If the audience can’t quickly connect what’s on your

    impact as a filter for picking projects not only makes your work more impressive
    but also conveys that your work is relevant to someone in the world. Examples
    of impact could be: you won a hackathon, the work was published, it generated
    $X in savings, X number of people downloaded the project, you presented it in
    front of X people, etc.'

    as domain knowledge and communication skills are also important. This is especially
    true if hiring is done by a non-technical audience (which is often the case at
    smaller organizations without a dedicated data science team).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One simple thing that can help is listing out all the domains in which you’ve
    worked. Additionally, having video or written content in which you are presenting
    a project or technical topic can help convey those critical communication skills.
