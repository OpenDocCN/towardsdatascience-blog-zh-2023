    no a clear idea of how to evaluate my model or even, if it was a good predictor
    or not. Now, I decided to write this post concentrating the action items I use
    to determine the goodness of my simple linear regression models. You will find
    a brief review of basics and assumptions of simple linear regression and then
    the list of to-dos examine the model.

- en: 'It is the simplest regression analysis model for examining the relationship
    between two variables: a dependent variable (also know as response, target or
    outcome) and the independent variable (also know as explanatory or predictor variable).
    The estimation of that relationship could be seen in a plot as a one straight
    line.'

    is determined by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between predicted
    values and actual values. For that purpose, we have to estimate the β0 and β1
    parameters. β0 represents the intercept, which is the expected value of the dependent
    variable *Y* when independent variable *x* is zero and, β1 represents the slope,
    which represents the change in the expected value of *Y* for a one-unit change
    in *x.*

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The R-squared is the proportion of the total variability of the dependent variable
    that can be explained by the independent variable in the linear regression model.
    It ranges from 0 to 1, where a closer value to 1 indicates a better fit.

    variables and, provides an indication of the linearity between them. A higher
    absolute value of the correlation coefficient suggests a closer adherence to a
    linear relationship. The square of the correlation coefficient is actually the
    R-squared.

    captures the essential relationship well and the variance of error terms are constant,
    see the left image below. The right image shows a megaphone effect which means
    the *constant variance (homoscedasticity) assumption* does not hold.

    a straight line. If plot does not show a straight line, the *normality assumption*
    is not hold and indicates of either a skewed distribution or, heavy-tail distribution.
    Below there are two examples of QQ plots, the one we want to see as a result of
    our model is the plot on the left.

    below shows a normal shape distribution of errors and it is what we expect to
    see from our models.

    it does not mean that the regression is not useful.
