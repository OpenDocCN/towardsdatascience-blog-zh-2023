    insights from his data only to now fail to effectively communicate them to his
    superiors. While the deadline for his big presentation is only hours away and
    closing in fast, he remains unaware that the charts he prepared are more confusing
    than insightful. The pie chart was a poor choice as it requires the reader to
    estimate angles, which we humans are really bad at. And that colorful bar chart
    will also not do him any favors, as he is clearly using the color attribute inappropriately,
    possibly leaving the reader wondering if they are looking at different categories
    here, which they are not.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data visualization is an essential technique that data scientists can draw on
    in order to gain exploratory insights, visualize trends and patterns, or communicate
    results to stakeholders. However, often times these charts lack clarity, are hard
    to read and interpret, or are simply too crowded with information to derive any
    meaningful insights from them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The opposite is often true as well. A visual representation that contains minimal
    information may be completely obsolete and a simple numerical representation or
    a table would make a better alternative.

    the clarity and effectiveness of the information you would like to convey.

    and that’s exactly what it is. Presenting two values in form of a chart doesn’t
    add any value or insight to the data. In fact, it makes it unnecessarily hard
    to read the exact numbers off the chart. Can you tell how many data engineers
    work in that department? Is it 33 or 34?

    is technically no hard and fast rule and often times this really depends on factors
    like the complexity of your data, your target audience, and the message you would
    like to convey. However, as a general guideline, if your data consists of **more
    than three values**, it may be worth considering a chart and presenting things
    visually, especially if that enables you to surface trends and patterns in your
    data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas charts are a great choice for visualizing numerical relationships, trends,
    distributions, or time-series data, they are, after all, an abstraction and normally
    don’t show the underlying, precise numbers. However, in certain domains such as
    medicine and finance, for instance, precision matters. In such cases, tables are
    the preferred choice.

    underlying data. This is because a 3D plot is still being projected onto two-dimensional
    space, and as a result, an *illusion of depth* is created on a flat surface. This,
    in turn, makes it very difficult for our brains to process the information and
    draw definitive conclusions from it.

    that would benefit from 3D visualizations, such as surface plots or [these beautiful
    population density charts](https://www.theinspiration.com/2023/01/population-density-maps-by-terence-fosstodon/).
    If your visualization is interactive and allows the user to properly explore it,
    that’s fine too. But as a general guideline, 3D charts should be avoided whenever
    possible, especially with simple charts like bar plots and scatter plots.

    decisions. Unfortunately, accessibility often carries a lesser priority in the
    world of data visualization, although awareness of this problem seems to be rising.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and background, colors and background, and among colors themselves. Using red
    and green colors together in graphs should also be avoided if possible to make
    charts more colorblind-friendly. Furthermore, providing alternative text as well
    as more descriptive titles and labels can help people who are using assistive
    technologies such as screen readers.
