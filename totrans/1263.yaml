    over differences, they may imply a false hierarchy of importance — unless that’s

    multiple times. I call it “the grayscale test.” You can do it easily in PowerPoint.
    You must select the “Grayscale” option instead of the “Color” option in the print
    tab. Then, the display in the “Print Preview” window will change its coloring.
    If you can still differentiate between series on categories in the visualizations,
    you can congratulate yourself: **you have done the job well.**'

    to a single hue (or a closely related set), varying intensity from light for low
    values to darker, more saturated colors for higher values. We intuitively perceive
    colors of increasing intensity as increasing numerical values, although this perception
    doesn’t extend to different colors.

    the performance of four divisions against a plan throughout the year, from worst
