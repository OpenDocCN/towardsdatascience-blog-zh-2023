    Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My justification for this at the time was
    that cameras were becoming smaller and more powerful; ML models were also commonplace
    in mobile and edge devices. Therefore, understanding how to design, engineer and
    implement ML models that solve computer vision problems will prove helpful in
    the long run and also allow me to position myself as a problem solver in several
    practical situations. One notable aspect of computer vision is that several manual
    tasks lend themselves well to computer vision solutions. Currently, I'm working
