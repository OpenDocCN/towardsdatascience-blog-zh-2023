    all synonyms with slightly different heydays as the term du jour, so they carry
    poetic connotations from different eras. These days, the cool kids prefer the
    ***synthetic data*** buzzword, perhaps because investors need to be convinced
    that something new has been invented, rather than rediscovered. And there is something
    slightly new in play here, but (in my opinion) not new enough for all the old
    ideas to be irrelevant.'

    theory* like I have (my therapist and I are still working through it over a decade
    later), you’ll be superfluously aware that there are infinite [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number).
    Among other things, ***infinite*** means that if you try to enumerate them all,
    I can swoop in like a jerk and find you a new one, for example by adding 1 to
    your largest number, taking the average of your two closest numbers, or popping
    a digit on the back of the number with the longest series of digits after the
    decimal point.

    how might I approach your request?

    spot my bff [Heather](http://bit.ly/quaesita_heather) (true story, she says hi),
    and measure her for your dataset. If your population of interest was all humans,
    her height would be a legit datapoint for your dataset if (and that’s big if)
    I measured it according to the rules you laid out for how your population should
    be measured.

    millimeters using one of those meter rulers, we’ll have problems.

    hides the true answer. And that’s exactly what’ll happen if I get it into my head

    a different profile from what’s in the rest of your data. To deal with the can
    of worms we’re potentially opening up here, be sure to include a record of the
    source of the data. (Who collected it — you or me?) You can always nuke my entries
    later… as long as they’re not hiding among your legit contributions.
