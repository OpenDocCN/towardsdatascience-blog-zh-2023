- en: Statistical independence is a fundamental concept in statistics. It forms a
    part of the underlying assumptions in a wide range of (supervised) machine learning
    algorithms such as the logit model and naive Bayes classifiers. It also closely
    related with the key methods in artificial intelligence such as the maximum entropy
    and neural network. See, for example, [this post](https://torstenvolk.medium.com/the-next-frontier-in-ai-replacing-statistical-independence-with-human-intuition-a39789f8c737)
    for further insights.
