    driving us toward the era of precision medicine. The motivation to develop AI
    health models is to reduce deaths and disease as well as prolong a high quality
    of life. Well trained models have the ability to more thoroughly analyze data
    that is presented which offers a more comprehensive assessment of one’s health.

- en: Image-based medical AI/ML models have now reached a maturity where they often
    rival or even surpass human performance, adeptly identifying patterns and anomalies
    that could easily elude the human eye. However, the majority of these models still
    operate on single time-point data, providing an isolated snapshot of health at
    one specific instance. Whether these are uni-modal or multi-modal models, they
    tend to work with data gathered within a relatively similar timeframe, forming
    the foundation of a prediction. Yet, in the broader context of AI/ML for medical
    applications, these single time-point models represent just the first step — the
    proverbial ‘low hanging fruit.’ One frontier of medical AI research is longitudinal
    models which offer a more holistic view of a person’s health over time.
  prefs: []

- en: Longitudinal models are designed to integrate data from multiple time-points,
    capturing an individual’s health trajectory rather than a standalone moment. These
    models tap into the dynamic nature of human health, where physiological changes
    are constant. The ability to map these changes to specific outcomes or health
    questions could be a game-changer in predictive healthcare. The concept of longitudinal
    data isn’t new to clinical practice — it’s regularly used to monitor aging and
    predict frailty. A prime example is the tracking of bone mineral density (BMD),
    a key marker for osteoporosis and frailty. Regular assessments of BMD can detect
    significant decreases, indicating potential health risks.

- en: Historically, the development of longitudinal models has faced several significant
    challenges. Aside from larger data volumes and computation required per individual,
    the most critical obstacle lies in the curation of longitudinal medical data itself.
    Unlike single time-point data, longitudinal data involves tracking patients’ health
    information over prolonged periods, often across multiple healthcare institutions.
    This requires meticulous data organization and management, making the curation
    process both time-consuming and expensive. Multiple successful studies have been
    funded to prospectively collect longitudinal data. These studies report challenges
    with respect to patient retention over a longer observation period. Hence, despite
    the potential benefits of longitudinal models, their development has remained
    a complex, resource-intensive endeavor.

- en: Changes in body composition, proportions of lean and fat soft tissue and bone,
    are known to be associated with mortality. In our study, we aimed to use body
    composition information to better predict all-cause mortality, in simpler terms,
    the likely timeline of a person’s life. We evaluated the performance of models
    built on both single time-point and longitudinal data, respectively referred to
    as our ‘single record’ and ‘sequential’ models. Single record models allowed us
    to evaluate what type of information was most predictive of mortality. Development
    of sequential models were for the purposes of capturing change over time and evaluating
    how that affects mortality predictions.

    Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study](https://healthabc.nia.nih.gov/)
    in which over 3000 older, multi-race male and female adults were followed and
    monitored for up to 16 years. This study resulted in a rich and comprehensive
    longitudinal data set. As a part of this study patients received total body dual
    energy X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging and several pieces of meta-data were
    collected. Consistent with best modeling practices and to avoid data leakage or
    mitigate overfitting, the data was split into a train, validation, and hold-out
    test set using a 70%/10%/20% split.

    (TBDXA) imaging which has long been considered a gold standard imaging modality.
    Historically, patient meta-data which include variables like age, body mass index
    (BMI), grip strength, walking speed, etc were used to assess aging/mortality and
    used as surrogate measurement of body composition. The prevalent use of patient
    meta-data and surrogate measures of body composition were driven by the limited
    accessibility to DXA scanners. Accessibility has improved greatly as of recent
    with scans becoming cheaper and no longer needing a physician referral/order/prescription.

    with the same output which was a 10 year mortality probability. The first model
    was built to only take patient meta-data and is a neural network with a single
    32-unit, ReLU activation hidden layer and sigmoid prediction layer. The second
    model used only TBDXA images as input and it consisted of a modified Densenet121
    which was modified to handle the two color channels as opposed to three color
    channels (RGB) seen in most natural images. The dual energy nature of DXA results
    in a high and low X-ray images which are fully registered and stacked into two
    image channels. The third model combines the meta-data embedding of model one
    with the TBDXA image embeddings of model two then passes it through a 512-unit,
    a 64-unit fully-connected ReLU layer to make, and lastly a sigmoid prediction
    layer.

- en: Three sequential models were built and evaluated. The single record model architectures
    served as the base for each sequential model but the sigmoid prediction layers
    were removed so that the output was a vector representing feature embeddings.
    Over the course of the study data was collected from each patient at multiple
    time points. The data from each time point was input into the appropriate models
    to acquire the corresponding feature vector. The feature vectors for each patient
    were ordered and stacked into a sequence. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model
    was trained to take the sequence of feature vectors and output a 10 year mortality
    prediction. As previously mentioned, there are several difficulties with conducting
    long term studies with retention and data collection being a common problem. Our
    study was not absent of these problems and some patients had more data points
    that others as a result. An LSTM model was chosen as the sequence modeling approach
    because they are not constrained to use the same input sequence length for each
    patient. I.e. LSTMs can work with sequences of varying length thus eliminating
    the need to pad sequences if patients were short the full set of data points (~10).

- en: Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) on the hold-out test
    set show that metadata performs better than using TBDXA image alone in both the
    single record and sequential models. However, combining meta-data and TBDXA imaging
    resulted in the best AUROCs in both modeling paradigms which indicates that imaging
    contains useful information, predictive of mortality that is not captured by the
    meta-data. Another way to interpret this is that the meta-data are not a full
    surrogate measure of body composition with respect to predicting mortality. If
    they were full surrogates, combining TBDXA imaging with meta-data would have resulted
    in no significant increase or change in AUROC. The fact that the combination resulted
    in better AUROCs indicates that imaging is providing orthogonal information beyond
    what the meta-data capture and further justifies the utility of imaging.

    the benefits of combining imaging with metadata, compared to using metadata alone.
    This analysis was conducted on the sequence models, which outperformed the single-record
    models. The IDI was found to be 5.79, with an integrated sensitivity and specificity
    of 3.46 and 2.33, respectively. This indicates that the combination of imaging
    and metadata improves the model’s ability to correctly identify those who will
    not survive the next 10 years by 3.46%, and enhances the ability to correctly
    identify those who will survive the next 10 years by 2.33%. Overall, this suggests
    an improvement in model performance of approximately 5.8%.

    the realm of predictive healthcare, specifically in the context of all-cause mortality.
    The comparative analysis of single record models and longitudinal models revealed
    that the latter offers superior performance, indicating the critical role of modeling
    change over time in health data analysis. The clinical implication of our findings
    include the ability to provide a more precise and holistic assessment of one’s
    health through models that account for a patient’s historical or longitudinal
    data. In addition, our in-depth analysis towards explainable AI provided insights
    into which variables are closely related to high 10-year mortality probability.
    Some of these variables are modifiable and can be addressed clinically, offering
    many the opportunity to improve their longevity and healthspan. While the data
    needed for developing longitudinal health models exists, the proper infrastructure
    and institutional support is not quite oriented yet to enable efficient data curation
    and development of these models at scale. Nevertheless, many are working to overcome
    these hurdles and the development of longitudinal models is one of many exciting
    frontiers for AI in medicine.

    have the potential to transform care delivery by enabling more precise, personalized
    predictions about a patient’s health trajectory. Such models can inform proactive
    interventions, thereby enhancing care outcomes and possibly even prolonging life.
    Moreover, the use of both metadata and imaging data sets a new precedent for future
    AI/ML models, suggesting a synergistic approach for optimal results. It reinforces
    the need for multidimensional, nuanced data to paint an accurate and holistic
    picture of a patient’s health. These findings represent significant strides in
    the application of AI/ML in healthcare, highlighting an exciting path forward
    in our pursuit of precision medicine.
