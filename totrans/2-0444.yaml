    Essentially, GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can create for specific
    purposes. The process of configuring a workable GPT involves no coding but purely
    through chatting. As a result, since the release, a diverse of GPTs have been
    created by the community to help users be more productive and create more fun
    in life.

    I use ChatGPT (GPT-4) a lot to help me understand complex technical concepts,
    debug issues encountered when implementing the model, and suggest novel research
    ideas or engineering solutions. Despite being quite useful, I often find ChatGPT
    struggles to give me tailored answers beyond its general knowledge of PINN. Although
    I can tweak my prompts to incorporate more contextual information, it is a rather
    time-consuming practice, and can quickly deplete my patience sometimes.

    be helpful as it gives quick pointers for practitioners to dig deeper. It also

    more details like how the sampling will be adjusted, or how to measure the network
    performance, etc. Also, the last suggestion, i.e., “Combining Data and Physics”,
    is rather unhelpful, as the whole idea of using PINN is to combine data with physics.

- en: For some of the directions, I have already seen work done recently. For others,
    I am not aware of any specific work, and they could be very interesting and fruitful
    to investigate! As a side note, the top-2 directions proposed by the GPT are definitely
    not its “original” idea. They are actually explicitly mentioned in the “potential
    future improvement” section of my blog which discusses the application of active
    learning to PINN. This shows that the customized GPT can seamlessly blend its
    general knowledge with the retrieved specific information to formulate the answer.

    the PINN world. In this section, let’s switch gears and discuss a few of the possible
    extensions ahead.

    announced every now and then. As a result, to make the expert GPT stay as an “expert”,
    it is vital to regularly update its knowledge base and inform it about the recent
    advances in PINN.'

    base only contains documents on the best practices of PINN. In addition, we could
    add other types of documents to enrich the diversity. For example, adding review
    papers in PINN could enable GPT to paint a better big picture for users; also,
    adding application-oriented research papers could inform PINN about realistic
    case studies, thus better-assisting users to complete their tasks.'

    research is evolving rapidly. Consequently, keeping up with the newest developments
    in libraries becomes harder and harder for practitioners. One promising way to
    improve productivity is to design a GPT to be a code copilot, with the software
    documents as the knowledge base. This way, the coding-assistant GPT could provide
    tailored coding solutions to the user’s problem, all through natural language
    communication.'

    GPT we have not yet touched is the so-called “Actions”. Essentially, those “Actions”
    are like “plug-ins” and they give the GPT the ability to take actions outside
    of ChatGPT. A recent work [1] explored the possibility of leveraging LLM to automatically
    invoke APIs for PINN software to assist users in task completion. For our case
    of creating expert GPTs, we could also give the expert GPT access to the API of
    the specialized PINN software, such that it can perform different types of analysis
    in an autonomous fashion. This could greatly lower the barrier for practitioners
    to harness the power of PINN and accelerate the adoption of PINN technology for
    various real-life problems.'

    newest GPTs functionality) that is specialized in PINN and can assist practitioners
    in their day-to-day work. We explained the process of creating this customized
    GPT and also showcased some scenarios where it could be more beneficial than the
    standard GPT. Those scenarios include:'
