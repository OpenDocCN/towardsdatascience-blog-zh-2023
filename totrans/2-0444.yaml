    Essentially, GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can create for specific
    purposes. The process of configuring a workable GPT involves no coding but purely
    through chatting. As a result, since the release, a diverse of GPTs have been
    created by the community to help users be more productive and create more fun
    in life.

    I use ChatGPT (GPT-4) a lot to help me understand complex technical concepts,
    debug issues encountered when implementing the model, and suggest novel research
    ideas or engineering solutions. Despite being quite useful, I often find ChatGPT
    struggles to give me tailored answers beyond its general knowledge of PINN. Although
    I can tweak my prompts to incorporate more contextual information, it is a rather
    time-consuming practice, and can quickly deplete my patience sometimes.

    advances in PINN.'

    papers in PINN could enable GPT to paint a better big picture for users; also,

    case studies, thus better-assisting users to complete their tasks.'

    GPT we have not yet touched is the so-called “Actions”. Essentially, those “Actions”
    are like “plug-ins” and they give the GPT the ability to take actions outside
    of ChatGPT. A recent work [1] explored the possibility of leveraging LLM to automatically
    invoke APIs for PINN software to assist users in task completion. For our case
    of creating expert GPTs, we could also give the expert GPT access to the API of
    the specialized PINN software, such that it can perform different types of analysis
    in an autonomous fashion. This could greatly lower the barrier for practitioners
    to harness the power of PINN and accelerate the adoption of PINN technology for
    various real-life problems.'
