- en: As Data Scientists, we are familiar with standard python libraries used for
    building Machine Learning algorithms. There is a high chance you have used pandas,
    NumPy, sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to build the models and then tools
    like Docker, Kubernetes, and big cloud providers to deploy and serve them. Those
    are excellent tools and they provide a lot of flexibility to the engineers but
    more often connecting all the pieces is not that straightforward. In the end,
    it takes weeks from initial data collection, building the models to finally serve
    them in production.

    to do all the necessary steps using the same tool in less time. This boosts productivity,
    allows fast prototyping, and finally can reduce the budget needed to develop Machine
    Learning solutions.

    model using a new [Machine Learning platform](https://tolokamodels.tech/home)
    and you can do it in less than an hour without writing code. You will leverage
    a pre-trained mode by choosing it from a catalog, and will not need GPU or any
    of your own resources to train or deploy the model. This approach is much faster
    than building your own solution from scratch and it is perfect for fast prototyping.
