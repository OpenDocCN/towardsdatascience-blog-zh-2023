    which are the best data visualization techniques when the purpose of the message
    to be delivered to the audience is **to show the composition of the data.**

    article, to read (or revisit) the [previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/storytelling-with-charts-fbd23ebb70ee)
    where the concept of **Composition** and some of its elements of analysis were
    described.
  prefs: []

    commonly used to show composition: pie charts; stacked bar charts; Treemaps; stacked
    area charts; waterfall charts; Marimekko charts.'

    Now, we will concentrate on the last three in that list (Stacked Area Charts;
    Marimekko Charts; Waterfall Charts).

    is: it is a type of line chart with the area between the line that connects data
    points and the horizontal axis **filled with a particular color**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are **four** different types of area charts: 1) Standard Area Charts;
    2) Stacked Area Charts; 3) Percent Stacked Area Charts; 4) Overlapping Area Charts.
    Only **Stacked Area Charts** (StACs) and **Percent Stacked Area Charts** (%StACs)
    are used to show Composition.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both Stacked Area Charts, **several areas are stacked on top of one another.**
    They display the evolution of a numerical variable over time (dynamic composition)
    with a third variable, **usually categorical**, used to show composition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Related to StAC, it is a **Part-to-Whole chart** where each area indicates the
    **absolute value** of each part referred to the total of the category. Related
    to %StAC, it is also a **Part-to-Whole chart** where each area indicates the **percentage**
    of each part referred to the total of the category. **There is no overlapping
    between the different areas.** In a StAC, the final height of the vertical axis
    is related to the sum of all the numerical values represented. In a %StAC, the
    final height of the vertical axis is always 100%.

- en: Figure 1 shows a StAC representing PS4 sales in four different regions between
    2013 and 2018\. The legends shown in the upper right corner of the chart indicate
    to which region the different colored areas belong. It can be seen how each region
    (each area, each part) contributes to total sales (the whole, sum of sales). The
    height of each area represents the absolute value in sales of each particular
    region whilst the final height is the sum of those values indicating total sales
    per year. It can be seen that a StAC should be used primarily to communicate the
    overall trend and the relative contribution of each part to the whole without
    being concerned about showing exact numerical values for each part.

    the **percentage** of each region related to total global PS4 sales. As indicated
    above, the final height is 100%. Undoubtedly, this type of chart allows a better
    analysis of the composition of worldwide sales than the one shown in Figure 1.

    (MCs) are similar to 100% stacked bar charts but differ from them in that their
    rectangular bars can have different widths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'MCs are used to show **two numerical variables** for each category present
    in the data set. They have two axes: the vertical axis has a 100% numerical scale
    whilst the horizontal axis can be either categorical or numerical. Rectangular
    bars are arranged in a vertical orientation with no space left between them. The
    entire width of the horizontal axis is occupied.'

    and region. The percentage vertical axis indicates percentages per region while
    the horizontal axis indicates annual revenues per brand. We are indicating in
    just one chart two numerical values for each category and each subcategory.

    divided into smaller rectangles of varying width; vertically stacked rectangles;
    a horizontal axis that occupies the entire width of the chart; a vertical axis
    with a percentage scale; total revenues per brand on the top baseline; different
    bar widths that allow calculating the relative contributions of each brand to

    for static analysis (to show composition at a moment in time). They should never
    be used to show composition changes over time.

    (WCs) are a particular type of bar chart representing the cumulative effects of
    data that swings between additions and subtractions. The message is to tell the
    story about **composition changes between two data points.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A WC consists of an initial vertical bar, a set of intermediate vertical bars,
    and a final vertical bar. The usual (and advisable) layout is that the initial
    and final vertical bars (columns) have the same color while the intermediate bars
    (**floating bars**) show a green value for additions and a red value for subtractions.
    It is also customary for the first and last columns to start at the zero baseline.

    above. This type of WC is habitually employed in human resources (showing hiring
    and attrition in a particular department), in a particular business (showing revenues
    and expenses), in a warehouse (stock added, stock taken), and in many other situations
    where data swings between positive and negative values. **Time-based WCs** are
    used in the financial industry (indicating gains and losses throughout a single
    period of time).

- en: A WC provides more contextual information than a standard bar chart. While the
    latter only shows the initial and final values, the former indicates the contribution
    of the elements of addition and subtraction to the total and the composition of
    change between those initial and final values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This remarkable ability to tell the story of the changes between the initial
    and the final values has its counterpart in the complexity of correctly interpreting
    the magnitude of the changes. This is due to the absence of a common baseline
    in the floating columns which makes it difficult to compare the particular sizes
    of successive additions and subtractions. The best practice is to add numerical
    annotations in the columns and linking them with connecting horizontal lines (Fig.4
    & Fig.5).

    transmitted: pie charts; stacked bar charts; Treemaps; stacked area charts; waterfall
    charts; Marimekko charts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our recommendation is to use pie charts for static composition and stacked bar
    charts for dynamic composition. Treemaps are a valid alternative when the Whole
    consists of ten or thousands of Parts. Marimekko charts are appropriate for representing
    two numerical variables including a principal category and its subcategories.
    Finally, a waterfall chart only shows the composition of change between initial
    and final values.
