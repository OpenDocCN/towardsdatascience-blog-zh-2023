    distribution. Skewed data is not suitable for many statistical analysis. The presence
    of one single outlier can drastically change the overall statistics of a distribution.
    Therefore, these extreme values need to be handled carefully. If there is no justification
    for these outliers, the general guideline is to get rid of those. In this article,
    we will go through the effect of outliers on skewness as well kurtosis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a platykurtic distribution, the peak is flatter and the tails are lighter
    than in a normal distribution because the kurtosis is less than zero. As a result,
    there is less concentration around the mean than in a normal distribution.

    includes outliers. We have discussed about outlier detections procedures before.
    One common strategy is the IQR (Interquartile range) method which is industry
    standard. The article below was written using python.

- en: The formula for skewness and kurtosis measurement is given above. Here, µ =
    sample mean and σ = sample standard deviation. In R, we can either define a function
    or use moments library to calculate skewness as shown in the code. The value skewness
    determined using the moments library is 0.2213737 and using formula, the skewness
    is 0.2211937 which seems pretty close. Since the value is greater than 0, the
    distribution is positively skewed.

    positive but less in magnitude. If we exclude the top 1% and bottom 1%, the skewness
    will be 0.1304348 which is also positive but less in magnitude compared to the
    original data. 105 trim will end up with a skewness value of 0.0212766\. Trimming
    25% makes it negatively skewed but this is not practical to trim 25% of the data
    on both side. Therefore it is obvious that the more data we trim, the less skewed
    the data will be.

    moments library and using formula are 2.298557 and 2.296066 respectively. The
    kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3\. If kurtosis is greater than 3, the distribution
    is considered leptokurtic and if kurtosis is smaller than 3, the distribution
    is considered platykurtic

    Qₚ is quantile at p. When p=0.025 (basically trimming 2.5% from top and 2.5% from
    bottom), quantile kurtosis is the ratio between 95% inner quartile interval to
    interquartile range. The calculated quantile-based kurtosis for age is 2.214286
    which is also smaller than 3\. Therefore, removing outliers didn’t have much impact
    on kurtosis value.

    with real world data with outliers require some sort of cleaning to remove those
    extreme values. Quantile-based skewness and kurtosis measurements are discussed
    as well industry standard outlier detection method (IQR) is implemented in R.
    Readers need to follow their own judgement about choosing outlier removal method.
