- en: Let’s get the first thing clear, a senior role is different from company to
    company, so please take this day-in-the-life with a grain of salt. The main difference
    between a senior and non-senior role, to me anyway, is that a senior position
    usually involves more collaboration cross-functionally between different teams
    and stakeholders. It may also be the case that you own an entire project, very
    similar to a product manager, where you are not only coming up with the solution,
    but also coming up with the why and its impact, say KPIs (*Key Performance Indicator*),
    for example. With that being said, let’s jump into an example of a typical day
    for a senior data scientist.

    level, so you will have a clear expectation of the order in which you will need
    to execute your tasks, whether that be a data request, or a longer project like
    obtaining features for your data science model. These asks can actually be a mix
    of others requesting from you to yourself organizing your own requirements for

    in progress, and what is now done. These facets might be different in your company.

- en: Every company has its differences and every role has its differences. However,
    there are still commonalities between senior data science roles. To summarize,
    the main takeaway is that senior data science positions do all that a normal data
    science position entails, but they also focus on the project from end-to-end more
    and act as a product manager for that project, entailing more responsibility in
    the process as a whole.

- en: In the senior position, you will have more interaction with product managers
    and company executives, so being able to communicate clearly and efficiently is
    a must. Next, prioritizing your tasks and main data science projects is incredibly
    important because you will find that there is this unlimited amount of work you
    can do, however, it is key to understand how one task or project compares to another.
    Lastly, even as you plan your roadmap, you will have to be used to pivoting to
    a different project as priority and urgency can change around a certain topic.
    These three facets of the role are especially prevalent in the senior position
    because you not only serve as the subject-matter expert, but you also tend to
    serve as the leader of the data science space in general in your company as well.
