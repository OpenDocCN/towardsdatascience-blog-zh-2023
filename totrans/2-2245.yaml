    engrossed in the thrill of devising sophisticated algorithms, captivating visualisations,
    and impressive predictive models.

    structure but also its hidden foundations, the effectiveness of machine learning
    systems pivots on an often-overlooked but entirely crucial aspect: the **data

    train.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    what if the tracks are compromised?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the quality of data feeding your system is not ensured upstream, it’s akin
    to a damaged rail track — ***your train is destined to derail***, sooner or later,
    especially when operating at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, it’s paramount to monitor data quality from the get-go, right at
    the source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like a train inspector examining the tracks ahead of a journey, we must scrutinise
    our data at its point of origin.
  prefs: []

    the Data Contract) between data producers and consumers to ensure the produced
    data meets specific quality standards.

    the standard they need to meet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let’s apply this concept to our data architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Schema changes are first carried out in version control and once approved, they
    are implemented in data-producing applications, databases, and a central ***Data
    Contract Registry***. This is where your data contract enforcement ideally begins
    — at the stage of data production itself. Any validation steps further downstream
    act as safeguards to prevent low-quality data from infiltrating the system.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data, once produced, is pushed to some messaging systems like Kafka topics.
    This could include events directly emitted by application services or raw data
    topics for ***Change Data Capture*** (CDC) streams.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, think of Flink applications as vigilant gatekeepers, consuming data from
    raw data streams and validating it against schemas in the Contract Registry.
  prefs:

- en: Data not meeting the contract — akin to rejects on an assembly line — is directed
    to the ***Dead Letter Topic***.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validated data is approved for the ***Validated Data Topic***, much like quality-approved
    goods ready for packaging and shipping.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The validated data is then sent to object storage for another round of validation,
    acting as a double-check mechanism.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a schedule, the data in the ***Object Storage*** undergoes validation against
    additional SLAs in Data Contracts. After passing this scrutiny, it’s pushed to
    the ***Data Warehouse***, where it’s transformed and modelled for analytical purposes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From here, the modelled and curated data takes a two-fold path. It’s sent to
    the ***Feature Store System*** for further feature engineering, and real-time
    features are ingested directly from the ***Validated Data Topic***. Note that
    ensuring data quality at this stage can be challenging due to the difficulty of
    conducting checks against SLAs.
  prefs:

    and Concept Drift.
