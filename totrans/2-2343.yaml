    While the discussion below is applicable to any p-value close to 0.05, let us

    I error with a low probability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the probability of Type II error (acceptance of a false H0), denoted β; statistical
    power (1-β); sample size; and losses from Type I and II errors, before the data
    is collected. Please see [this post](https://medium.com/@jaekim8080/how-to-choose-the-level-of-significance-minimizing-expected-loss-b85b69648c01)

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the p-value is close to 0.05, there are three points for a decision-maker
    to consider. These points should jointly or individually be weighed against the
    p-value, and the final value of α should be determined or adjusted accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Effect size***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is whether the estimated value of θ indicates a strong effect. Suppose
    again p-value = 0.052 and the effect is found to be strong, then the researcher
    should reject H0, by choosing the value of α of 0.10 or higher. Conversely, if
    the effect is found to be negligible, then it is appropriate not to reject H0,
    by choosing the value of α of 0.01 or lower.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the effect is negligible, then it means that H0 is highly likely and it
    is reasonable to avoid Type I error by setting a low value for α. Conversely,
    if the effect is strong and H1 is highly likely, it is reasonable to avoid Type
    II error by setting a high value for α. This will reduce the value of β (probability
    of Type II error), as a result of the trade-off between α and β.

- en: '***Relative loss of Type I and II errors***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    known or estimable, the researchers should incorporate the relative loss into
    their decision-making.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose again p-value = 0.052\. Let us assume that Type I error (rejecting the
    true H0) is going to incur a loss of $1M, while Type II error (accepting the false
    H0) will make little loss. Then, the researcher should avoid Type I error by controlling
    it with a low probability such as 0.01 or lower, i.e., by setting α ≤ 0.01\. So,
    in this case, it is rational not to reject H0 at α = 0.01.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conversely, suppose the Type II error is much more costly than Type I error.
    Then, the researcher should increase the value of α to reduce the value of β and
    to avoid the Type II error. This is again on the basis of the above-mentioned
    trade-off between α and β. In this case, it is rational to set α ≥ 0.10 and reject
    H0.

    of a strong effect. In this case, when the p-value = 0.052, it is not reasonable
    to accept H0 at α = 0.05\. When the prior knowledge strongly supports H1, then
    a high value of α should be chosen so that a low value is given to β. This is
    because, given that H1 is highly likely, the researcher wants to control Type
    II error with a low probability. Hence, in this case, it is reasonable to set
    α ≥ 0.10, and reject H0.
