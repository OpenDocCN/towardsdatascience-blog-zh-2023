- en: If youâ€™ve taken a software development/project management class or training,
    you have probably heard of Agile. Agile is a set of software development practices
    that focuses on adaptive planning, early delivery, continual improvement, and
    flexible responses to changes in requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Agile is quite popular in software development, the flexibility that comes
    with these practices can be just as, if not more effective in data science projects.
    In fact, Microsoft released an iterative data science framework in 2016 that specifically
    applies agile principles to data science projects.

- en: 'TDSP is a methodology that applies Agile principles to efficiently deliver
    data science solutions. The backbone of TDSP is a concept called the **data science
    lifecycle** which is analogous to the *software development lifecycle* in Agile.
    The data science lifecycle involves five lifecycle steps that occur iteratively
    in data science projects:'

- en: In this methodology, every data science project starts by defining a business
    problem and understanding the business requirements. This leads to the data acquisition
    and understanding step, which is a prerequisite for any model development work
    to occur. Once we have a model that performs well we can deploy it in a production
    environment or present the results in the form of dashboards or reports.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If at any point we are not satisfied with our results or faced with changing
    requirements we can return to a previous step since this methodology is focused
    on iterative development. Each step is explained in greater detail in the sections
    that follow.

    three main tasks:'

    as uploading files to a working directory in Jupyter.'
  prefs:

    analysis (EDA) and involves preprocessing and understanding the attributes and

    the third step and potentially even the first step may need to be performed by
    a data engineer. This stage highlights the importance of skill sets other than
    data science on data science teams. While the data scientists on the team are
    working on EDA, the data engineers may be working on setting up a data pipeline,
    which allows us to complete this stage quicker.

    scientists, is dependent on the successful completion of the previous two stages.
    The quality of our models is ultimately limited by the quality of our data as

    data that we have explored, we are ready to start the modeling stage, which has
    three key steps:'

    fit the constraints of the problem? 3) is this model suitable for production?'
  prefs:

    that the results are not satisfactory and return to the feature engineering and
    model training stages to craft better features and try different modeling approaches.
    It is not uncommon and in fact expected that we will train and evaluate multiple
    models in this stage.

- en: While Agile principles have often been applied to software development, we can
    also argue that these principles are even more essential in data science projects.
    Microsoftâ€™s Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is a framework that applies Agile
    principles to data science and is designed around a five-step data science lifecycle.
    TDSP is well designed to reflect the stages in most data science projects and
    allows data science teams to use an iterative approach to adapt to change.
