- en: If you’ve taken a software development/project management class or training,
    you have probably heard of Agile. Agile is a set of software development practices
    that focuses on adaptive planning, early delivery, continual improvement, and
    flexible responses to changes in requirements.
  id: totrans-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Agile is quite popular in software development, the flexibility that comes
    with these practices can be just as, if not more effective in data science projects.
    In fact, Microsoft released an iterative data science framework in 2016 that specifically
    applies agile principles to data science projects.

    data science solutions. The backbone of TDSP is a concept called the **data science
    lifecycle** which is analogous to the *software development lifecycle* in Agile.
    The data science lifecycle involves five lifecycle steps that occur iteratively
    in data science projects:'

    problem and understanding the business requirements. This leads to the data acquisition
    and understanding step, which is a prerequisite for any model development work
    to occur. Once we have a model that performs well we can deploy it in a production
    environment or present the results in the form of dashboards or reports.

    data science on data science teams. While the data scientists on the team are
    working on EDA, the data engineers may be working on setting up a data pipeline,
    which allows us to complete this stage quicker.

    Microsoft’s Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is a framework that applies Agile
    principles to data science and is designed around a five-step data science lifecycle.
    TDSP is well designed to reflect the stages in most data science projects and
    allows data science teams to use an iterative approach to adapt to change.
