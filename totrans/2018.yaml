- en: Around ten years ago, music streaming services were competing heavily for the
    best music recommendation system. Clearly, a flawless recommendation system would
    provide the user with the exact piece of music that optimally satisfies their
    needs, every time. However, some people view recommendation systems as transitional
    technology. Ultimately, no matter the size of your music catalog, there can’t
    be a perfect fit available for each possible user request.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modern generative AI systems could potentially solve this problem by generating
    music that is (robot) hand-tailored to each request. On the other hand, these
    generative systems are still not producing high-quality music, have tremendous
    computational costs, and are subject to complex ethical and legal concerns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, this article aims to compare the benefits & limitations of search-based
    music retrieval and music generation to find out whether we should expect generative
    systems to fully replace, augment, or not even affect the current solutions. Before
    we start, let’s define what we mean by a “search algorithm” and a “generative
    model”.

- en: A search algorithm is a solution to a search problem. A search problem exists
    when a user wants to retrieve a piece of information or an object like a video
    or a song from a database. Let’s call the user’s request the *query* and the result
    of the search the *response*. The goal of a search algorithm is to find that piece
    of information that optimally satisfies the user’s needs, i.e. provides an optimal
    response for the given query.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there is also a time constraint on the search problem. Most of the
    time, we would prefer to receive the second-best response after 10 seconds over
    the absolute best response after 10 hours. Therefore, a search algorithm should
    find a response that is qualitatively satisfactory, within a reasonable time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A generative model is a solution to a prediction problem. Based on a set of
    input parameters (*query*), the model generates a prediction for what the optimal
    *response* to the query could look like. For example, when we feed an image generation
    model like DALL-E 2 with the prompt “a hand-drawn sketch of a penguin knight”,
    this serves as our query. The model then predicts how the pixels in an image that
    fits the text description would look. The query doesn’t have to be a text prompt,
    however. In the context of music, it could also be a chord sequence, a MIDI file,
    or even a video clip that we would like to generate fitting music for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like search algorithms, generative models are evaluated based on the quality
    of responses but also based on the time it takes to generate a response. Again,
    if the perfect generated piece of music takes 10 hours to compute, I would often
    rather take an almost-perfect generation that takes only 10 seconds.

    to an end, for example in advertising. Because functional music has clearly defined
    goals, it is easier to analyze how generative models vs. search algorithms serve
    this purpose. Absolute music, i.e. music that is listened to purely for the sake
    of listening to it, may not be affected by technological advancements in the same
    way as functional music.

    current state-of-the-art music generation models like Google’s [MusicLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/)
    or Meta’s [MusicGen](https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/) are able to generate
    music of a quality comparable to humans. If you get extremely lucky, MusicGen
    can produce responses that you could use for a low-effort 10-second TikTok clip.
    At the same time, Spotify’s search algorithm has access to tens of millions of
    high-quality recordings. Currently, generative models stand no chance against
    search algorithms in terms of quality.

    that this is about to change, and sooner than we expect. When GPT-1 was released
    by OpenAI in 2018, it could produce text that was oftentimes grammatically correct
    but clearly far away from human quality. In 2023, authors like [Christoph Molnar](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/proofreading-an-entire-book-with)
    are using GPT-4 to proofread their books, because they trust its writing capabilities
    more than their own. I believe that MusicGen (June ’23) is somewhere between GPT-1
    (June ’18) and GPT-2 (February ’19) in terms of response quality. At some point
    in the next few years, I expect generative music models to produce music that,
    in terms of objective (or inter-subjective) quality criteria, outcompetes most
    human musicians.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I believe that humans will have the upper hand in terms of creating music that
    is emotionally and culturally meaningful, for a long time. However, when it comes
    to functional music, we are mostly looking for music that sets a specific mood
    or fits particular circumstances. Just as ChatGPT can write texts in pretty much
    any style, language, and format you can think of, generative music models will
    be able to generate music that exactly satisfies any criteria you may have. While
    search algorithms can retrieve a particular song that fits the query best in a
    given database, generative models might be able to generate **the** optimal response,
    period.

    terms of the quality of responses — referring to both the quality of the music
    itself and the degree to which the response fits the query. However, I expect
    generative AI to catch up on search in the quality dimension and to surpass it
    in terms of fit within the next couple of years.

- en: We automate tasks using machines because, once we figure out how to make them
    perform them reliably, they become much faster at it than humans. With that, we
    might as well close this chapter, already. Well, almost… There are a few topics
    worth discussing when it comes to the efficiency and cost of AI-generated music
    as opposed to searching for existing music in databases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, AI-generated music might not be as cheap as you would think. While
    the computational process itself will become cheaper and cheaper, using such models
    effectively will require skilled IT professionals who construct, maintain, and
    use the underlying computing infrastructure. Alternatively, we can rely on third-party
    services that also don’t work for free. Moreover, the debate about copyright and
    royalties for AI-generated music is far from being settled. If using AI-generated
    music comes with royalty fees per generation or usage, costs would rack up rapidly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, human-generated music is not as expensive as you would think. Obviously,
    an AI can generate 30 seconds of music within minutes, while this would take a
    professional musician anything between an hour and a day. However, a price tag
    is based on supply and demand, not on the time spent on the task. All over the
    world, there are tens of millions of musicians, creating music as a hobby and
    offering it to others virtually for free. Of course, high-quality music or even
    custom-made pieces are expensive. However, the average content creator can find
    great human-made music that is free and eligible for commercial use within minutes.

    humans and that this gap will widen even further in the future. On the other hand,
    there is a considerable amount of skilled musicians producing music for free,
    which is as cheap as it gets. AI beats humans in speed, but not in the willingness
    to work for free for a personal or higher goal. In the end, the crux could be
    the open question of whether AI-generated music will require some sort of royalty
    fee. We will see about that.

    are still in charge (as of August 2023). Slavery has significant economic advantages
    (to the slaver) and yet, slavery was eradicated in the Western world due to ethical
    considerations. Even if AI-generated music is economically more promising than
    searching human-made music catalogs, which it very well might be for functional
    music, it doesn’t mean that we have to accept it. There are several reasons for
    opposing AI-generated music replacing human craftsmanship, which I will briefly
    touch on and discuss.

    that media companies, content creators, etc. use to search for the music they
    need. One concern is that when we move from catalogs to generative AI, this income
    stream will be eradicated, effectively replacing humans with machines. While I
    do share this concern, I don’t believe that the prohibition of generative AI for
    these purposes would be a good solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, prohibition usually hasn’t worked out too well, aside from extreme-risk
    technologies like nuclear bombs or biological weapons. Instead, I think that the
    ethical thing to do is to support the affected musicians to find new opportunities
    to make an income, once this shift occurs. If the individual musician prepares
    for this scenario, supported by the relevant organizations, they are either appropriately
    set up or positively surprised, depending on how strong the disruption will be.

    music, often without paying any royalties to the musicians. While my emotional
    reaction to this is negative, it is not easy, ethically, to argue why this is
    wrong. After all, human musicians also draw inspiration from copyright-protected
    music for all their lives and write their own pieces based on that. How is that
    any different from what an AI does?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think that there are two points where this argument falls short. Firstly,
    scale matters. As humans, we also memorize personal information about thousands
    of people we meet in our lives, all without signing data protection agreements.
    However, when Google does this at scale, we take issue with that, because Google
    can use this data to gain a level of power that is impossible for humans to reach
    in a lifetime. This is analogous to generative AI. Every human knows some music.
    A large generative AI model can know ALL music, which brings it to a unique position
    of power, requiring a different ethical judgment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, listening to my favorite bands and combining their ideas to produce
    new music does not pose a risk to any band‘s economic success. However, you could
    argue that generative AI systems are effectively trained on human musicians' work
    in order to replace them. In my opinion, this demands a certain level of protection
    for the musicians, possibly in the form of royalties.

    however, I want to highlight that technological developments in the future will
    be significantly shaped by ethical considerations turned into politics and finally
    into law. In the past, a technology-positive mindset has usually turned out to
    be more effective. However, this doesn’t mean that we have to put up with any
    kind of unethical behavior in the name of technological progress. Currently, people
    still shape AI. Let’s make use of that before we get more and more dependent on
    these systems.

    human-level generative AI for almost any musical genre. Sure, these systems will
    have their limitations, but so does ChatGPT — and look how it has changed the
    way we write texts. However, while I think that AI will compete with highly-skilled
    human musicians at some point, I don’t believe that AI will ever generate “objectively
    better” music than expert musicians which would automatically render humans obsolete.
  prefs: []

    music. Even if AI can’t objectively outclass them in terms of musical quality,
    it might win most ad placements, sync deals, etc. due to AI producing customized
    music of the same quality, but cheaper and faster. This is a major career risk
    for hundreds of thousands of musicians worldwide which should not be lightly dismissed.
    While that is not the focus of this article, I want to make it clear that I don’t
    think AI will destroy musicianship or the job of a musician (see [here](https://youtu.be/0mDFeS-J9Qg)
    or [here](https://youtu.be/5wWZPiglyR0) for example).
  prefs: []

    combination of both seems like the most practical and therefore most likely scenario.
    Even if generative models could produce such highly customized music that human
    music catalogs would be made obsolete, search algorithms would remain relevant.
    Since generative music AI will be dirt-cheap at some point, there will be no reason
    not to generate 10, 100, or 1000 different customized pieces of music and use
    some kind of search algorithm to find the best one out of those. Generative AI
    could replace the music catalogue, but not the algorithm that searches through
    it and retrieves an optimal result.

    For instance, is not obvious that AI-generated music will remain free of copyright
    or some kind of royalty-mechanism. Beyond that, even crazier things could happen.
    Regulators might decide that any machine-generated content (text, image, audio,
    …) must be declared as such whenever shown to the user. This could lead media
    companies and content creators to refrain from using AI-generated music to avoid
    the stigma associated with it. Out of the three domains addressed in this article,
    the ethical and legal one seems the most uncertain.

    music. This is especially true for functional music, where the end-user doesn’t
    care whether the music was created by a human or a machine. On the other hand,
    we already have millions of human-made songs in the world that are offered virtually
    for free. This makes search algorithms a worthy competitor to generative models,
    even in the future. Ethical and legal considerations make everything even more
    uncertain and complicated. In the end, I suspect that both, generative models
    and search algorithms will have their place in the age of AI.
