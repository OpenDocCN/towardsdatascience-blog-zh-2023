    significant portions of their software as closed-source. This stems largely from
    the proprietary nature of the technologies they develop, crucial to their business

    that Apple exerts control over what can be offered on its platform and sets certain
    rules and guidelines that developers must adhere to. One of these rules is that
    all in-app purchases must go through Apple’s own payment system, for which Apple
    takes up to a 30% commission. This has caused discontent among some app creators,
    as it can significantly reduce their profit margins. The most notable dispute
    involving this policy has been with Epic Games, the developer of the popular game
    Fortnite. In August 2020, Epic Games tried to bypass Apple’s payment system by
    implementing its own payments in-game, leading to Fortnite being removed from
    the App Store.

    for obtaining digital content. They prevent all other app stores from competing
    with them on hardware that’s owned by a billion end users. That’s the first tie
    and that completely obstructs all competition and market forces that would shape
    better app stores and better deals for consumers.”

    of their operations, the underpinnings of that very software often go unnoticed,

    virtually nonexistent.

    Yet, it continues to prevail, to the detriment of not only the developers but
    also the wider tech industry and the extensive user base that depends on the products
    they maintain. Consider OpenSSL as a case in point. This open-source project,
    fundamental to virtually every contemporary networking device, used to receive
    a mere $2,000 per year in donations. The spotlight cast on it by the Heartbleed
    vulnerability bumped donations up to a still-meager $9,000 per year. The team
    behind OpenSSL, the software the vast majority of the internet leans on, stated
    they need a half-dozen full-time members to work on the project, as opposed to
    just one struggling to balance contract work to cover costs.

    Limited resources equate to less time and energy dedicated to comprehensive testing,
    bug fixes, and security patches.

    when resources are strained. After all, when the battle is for the project’s survival

    This constraint hampers the growth of open-source projects and stymies the tech
    ecosystem that heavily relies on them.
  prefs: []

    ancient as the concept of open source itself. Some developers have found modest
    success through platforms like GitHub Sponsors and GitCoin, or via maintenance
    contracts with companies. Others have secured roles at firms that remunerate them
    to maintain their libraries. However, these cases are exceptions rather than the
    norm and are rarely sufficient to fully support the maintenance and development
    of open-source projects.

    Until the industry concocts a more effective support mechanism for this ‘free’
    labor, we should brace ourselves for more acts of civil disobedience from open-source
    developers, resorting to drastic measures to underscore their contributions.

    nearly three decades, continue to devote their time and expertise largely without

    these formidable challenges, the heart of open source — its community — remains
    unwavering. Developers persist in contributing to open source projects, fueled
    by their passion and commitment to the ethos of open collaboration. As Marak Squires
    and the developer of “left-pad” have demonstrated, there’s a potent sense of ownership

    be succeeded by meaningful action. Governments can provide financial support for
    crucial open-source projects, particularly those with notable security implications,
    or incentivize companies to do so. They can also formulate legislation to safeguard
    the rights of open-source contributors and establish frameworks for equitable
    compensation.

    as well. Open source contributors deserve recognition for their labor, transcending
    a mere mention in a README file, but genuinely acknowledging the value they add.
    This recognition can manifest in various forms, from featuring contributors at
    industry events to offering them a voice in strategic decision-making for the
    projects they maintain. In this manner, contributors can transition from being
    viewed as volunteers to key stakeholders in the future’s digital infrastructure.

    their voices, fight for their rights, and ensure their labor receives the value
    it deserves. They can also elect to support projects that adhere to ethical practices
    and prioritize their maintainers’ well-being. However, the most pragmatic solution
    might be for open source developers to forge their own success pathways. I’m reminded
    of a fitting quote from the pioneering inventor, Nikola Tesla:'

    is that? Perhaps the responsibility falls on open source creators to devise straightforward
    payment solutions and demand remuneration for their efforts, much like the existing
    software giants do on a daily basis.

    but it’s a journey we must undertake collectively. As the open-source ethos reminds
    us, our strength lies in unity. As maintainers, contributors, users, corporations,
    and governments, we each have a part to play in ensuring open source continues
    to flourish for the benefit of all. Let’s commit to realizing that vision, and
    to fostering a future where open source is not merely sustainable, but genuinely
    valued.

    is a looming issue that needs our immediate attention. This is not about reviving
    a failing system, but about mobilizing a collective effort that encapsulates the
    spirit of unity, collaboration, and pursuit of a shared goal for the common good.
    The open-source community, in its broadest sense, represents this unity. But for
    this vision to take shape, we need to address the stark realities the community
    currently faces.

    rich mosaic of software packages and libraries, contributed by developers worldwide,
    propels a significant portion of our digital existence. However, it is also confronting
    a crisis that threatens to destabilize this ecosystem. This threat is not external;
    it is internal, driven by an unsustainable model of unrelenting work, often unpaid,
    by a relatively small cohort of devoted maintainers. This predicament is as profound
    as it is existential. If left unattended, it may pose a considerable risk to the
    future of software development.

    it becomes imperative that we solve this issue now.** If left unchecked, we could

    quality code. This would be the end of free and open source software as we know
    it.'

    it’s a stark warning of the potential repercussions we face if we allow this unsustainable
    condition to continue unchecked. The software landscape of the future could be
    riddled with security issues, operational slowdowns, and loss of crucial tools
    if maintainers are driven to their limits or decide to abandon their projects.

    users, we can give back to the projects from which we derive benefit, whether
    by aiding with development, documentation, or offering financial support. Corporations,
    too, can reciprocate the projects they use, provide funding, or employ open-source
    developers to perpetually maintain and enhance their open-source projects. Governments
    can acknowledge the worth of open source in public infrastructure and offer grants
    and other forms of support to help sustain these projects.

    taking open source for granted and began recognizing and rewarding the indispensable
    work executed by maintainers. By doing so, we can ensure the continued health
    and vitality of this extraordinary global resource upon which we all rely.

    initiate a dialogue. Together, we can ensure the sustainability and vibrancy of
    the future of open-source software.'
