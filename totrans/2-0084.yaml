    be taken at face value. Whether you’re actively working on your own data science
    project(s) or perusing the products other data scientists are quickly developing,
    it is absolutely essential that you know how to critically evaluate the data therein.

    is of the utmost importance. In this article, we’ll take a look at four powerful
    ways to help ensure we’re analyzing it as effectively as possible.

- en: When you interact with most AI systems, they will claim that because they are
    machines, they have no opinions. However, this simply isn’t true. All artificial
    intelligence systems are strongly driven by inherent biases in the data used to
    train them. As a result, any biases inherent in the data are transferred into
    the model. This is the reason many AI systems can be discriminatory — a famous
    example of this is [bias in facial recognition technology](https://www.theregreview.org/2021/03/20/saturday-seminar-facing-bias-in-facial-recognition-technology/)
    [1]. Furthermore, in many cases, raw quantitative data simply isn’t enough to
    capture the important aspects of the data.

    of user-generated content could improve the end results on a number of levels.
    At different times during a user’s creation of content and engagement with recommended
    content, system prompts could ask optional qualitative questions about the created
    content, such as social and local context, and the user’s motivations behind creating
    the content, as a few possibilities. Should users choose to answer these questions,
    the additional qualitative content can be incorporated into the SRA’s choices
    in making recommendations, as it strives to produce more meaningful content for
    a user to engage with. Such a feature could let users determine which levels of
    additional information and context they offer to SRAs to infer and incorporate
    into suggestions.”

    apparent accuracy, there are more false positives than true positives. In other
    words, there are so many people that don’t have the disease that even the seemingly
    small rate of false positives corresponds to a pretty high raw number.
