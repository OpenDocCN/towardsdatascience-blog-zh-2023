    required and costs are often difficult to estimate. Clients want to implement
    their use cases efficiently and successfully with machine learning methods. You
    can positively influence consistent project control with meaningful **key performance
    indicators (KPIs)**. According to some [studies](https://designingforanalytics.com/resources/failure-rates-for-analytics-bi-iot-and-big-data-projects-85-yikes/),
    85% of all data science projects fail, which requires early identification of

    are not sufficient for data science projects. For this reason, in this article
    we present basic KPIs for IT projects and analyse them with regard to data science

    cockpit. IT projects are usually managed on the basis of a project order. A project
    description usually defines the scope of the project and the expected project
    goals on the part of the client. However, the project description often only contains
    rough descriptions, which is why refinement is necessary. Finally, we need to
    derive a roadmap with milestones and resource and cost planning. The milestones
    are essential in project controlling because they determine the timing of reviews
    and thus facilitate the classification of the work status in the overall project.

    project progress (milestones), productivity of the activities and innovation support
    of the processes. The critical success factors from the employee perspective can
    be, for example, the satisfaction of the project employees, the qualification
    of the project employees and team development.

- en: At the beginning of a data science project, it is often not clear what potential
    a data analysis has for the client. The first step is to find a suitable use case.
    In practice, an initial workshop is often held at the beginning of a project to
    identify use cases with high business potential. It should also be noted that
    the question and the data must fit together. In this context, data scientists
    should already be involved, as they can better assess possible potential based
    on possible data sources. Once you have found the use case, you can determine
    KPIs to measure the project success. In this context, it is essential to consider
    not only classic controlling KPIs but also the measurement of real business value
    (ROI), such as the reduction of machine downtime by 30%. At this stage, it should
    be clear what utility value we want to achieve. In this phase, we define the use
    case and the associated goals. The goals become measurable through the definition
    of KPIs. Therefore, the goals should also be set in relation to the machine learning
    model to be developed. You can control the expected model quality using various
    metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision recall, F1 score, AUC score, confusion matrix
    or lift factor). At this stage, you can set a minimum requirement. We refer to
    these KPIs as **Data Science KPIs** in this article, and you can use them in addition
    to the classical KPIs.

    In this step, a data scientist must obtain an overview of the data and assess
    its quality. But what is meant by data quality? Data quality describes how well
    the data is suited to the use case. A data scientist checks the data quality using
    criteria such as correctness, relevance, completeness, consistency and availability.
    The focus of a data scientist should always be on data quality and not only on
    data quantity. After an initial assessment by a data scientist, there is usually
    an estimation of effort and budget planning.

    Data preparation takes up about 50–70% of the total project duration. For this
    reason, it is important to adjust the project controlling with regard to this.
    During data preparation, close communication with the client is necessary so that
    domain-specific aspects can be taken into account in the data preparation. It
    must be clarified how to deal with missing values or outliers. In this phase,
    special attention should be paid to the KPI realisation value, as the workload
    in this phase is usually very high. You should ensure that the time spent does
    not exceed a certain upper limit of, for example, 60% of the total hours. However,
    you have to choose this upper limit specifically for the project. Furthermore,
    you should ensure that the project plan is adhered to (KPI project plan deviation).

    procedures. Subsequently, the analysis results are evaluated and compared with
    the objectives. These phases are iterative, as you can always switch back to the
    modelling phase to adjust the model concerning the evaluation metrics. These two
    phases serve as a feasibility study. At this point, it’s clear whether a data
    science project achieves the set goals. In this phase, you should pay attention
    to the Data Science KPIs defined in the business understanding.

    many problems. That is also the reason why many service companies want to develop
    further in this area. The service providers advertise their competence in the
    data science field and enter into negotiations with potential customers. First,
    the service provider conducts a potential analysis. The potential analysis shows
    whether the project generates added value for the client. A data science project
    will start if the potential analysis was successful. From our experience, many
    data science projects use the CRISP-DM process model. Experienced project managers
    from the IT industry often lead the projects. The project manager runs the project
    as a classical IT project. The project managers use KPIs for project controlling,
    with which they have had a good experience.
  id: totrans-89
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From our experience, these projects can be successful or fail. The reason for
    this is that the project managers often do not have an understanding of specific
    data science KPIs. We think that specific data science KPIs make the project more
    transparent for all stakeholders. It is essential to define quantifiable goals
    so that you can measure the success of a data science project. From our experience,
    it is also helpful if the project manager already has an understanding of data
    science. The communication and controlling will be more transparent if that is
    so. Furthermore, it is useful to divide data science projects into phases. You
    can use the CRISP process model, so it is clear where you are in the project.

- en: The analysis showed that you should use KPIs from the IT environment in data
    science projects. Examples are budget compliance and project benefit (ROI). It
    is essential to define the ROI so that you can measure the real benefit of the
    project. From our experience, it is always helpful to implement a prototype very
    quickly that already impressively demonstrates the ROI. **This prototype makes
    the client more relaxed, and the motivation to further optimise the prototype
    increases on all sides.** In addition, it creates a better working atmosphere,
    which increases the staff satisfaction index. However, we have also learned from
    our previous projects that you should not manage a data science project like a
    classical IT project. Other aspects also play a role. You have to integrate data
    science KPIs into the controlling process. The data science KPIs ensure greater
    transparency in the development. In addition, the project manager should be familiar
    with the data science KPIs for a successful data science project. We can agree
    with the thesis because we have to use specific data science KPIs in data science
    projects.

    are still in a finding phase for the best KPIs. The experiences of the project
    managers and successful project implementations will ensure that further KPIs
    emerge that can contribute to the successful project controlling of data science
    projects.
