    For many of us, Data Science wasn’t a career option we knew about when picking
    university/job options in school. We only came across the field at a later age,
    and so we’re now trying to make career changes while working full-time in another

    It’s easy to end up working late into the evenings or cancelling plans on weekends

    feel fun in the short term (e.g. on one individual evening), if continually repeated
    they can gradually become draining. And I mean *really* draining. What’s sustainable
    in the short term quickly becomes unsustainable in the medium- to long-term, and
    your “career change” can morph from a fun personal development activity into a
    chore that takes you away from the important things in life.

    something, because the chances are that there will be others who are able to help.
    Data Science hiring managers know this, and it’s why they don’t require people
    to know everything before they get the job. Everyone understands that you’ll have
    to do some learning on the job, so don’t worry about needing to learn *everything*
    before you apply to jobs.

    SQL. It’s been around since 1979 and it’s not going anywhere anytime soon — many

    and it’s one of the [most loved languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022#section-most-popular-technologies-other-tools)

    to apply for your first job. Despite what you might read online, you don’t need
    to master things like Linear Algebra and Discrete Optimisation before you’re eligible
    to work as a Data Scientist. Sure, a lot of people who come from mathematical
    backgrounds *did* learn those before they got their break in Data Science, but
    I’m not convinced they’re truly needed for most entry-level jobs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re not convinced, you might find it helpful to hear that being a *Data
    Scientist* in the field of AI/Data is very different than being a *Research Scientist*
    in this field. Research Scientists are in many ways closer to being mathematicians
    and/or software engineers. They’re the ones working at start-ups or Big Tech building
    out new Data Science tools and algorithms, and as a result they need to have a
    very deep understanding of the underlying mathematical and engineering concepts.
    Data Scientists, by contrast, tend to be more on the *applied* end of the spectrum;
    the role is much more focused on solving business problems than on developing
    entirely new technologies and techniques. If you want to see this for yourself,
    try searching for some Research Scientist job roles and see how they differ from
    Data Scientist ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point I’m making is that, if you’re looking to become a Data Scientist,
    it’s OK to not be up-to-date with *all* of the underlying mathematics or the most
    cutting-edge technologies and methods. Don’t get me wrong — you still need to
    have an awareness (you’d look silly if you’d never heard of ChatGPT, or if you
    didn’t know what a matrix/vector is), but unless you’re being recruited for an
    NLP role specifically you probably won’t need to be able to describe the architecture
    of ChatGPT and know the ins-and-outs of LSTMs from day 1\. So lessen your burden
    and don’t worry about learning *everything*.
