    may collect data from individuals or households about their demographic characteristics,
    such as age, gender, and country of birth, as well as their socio-economic characteristics,
    such as income, occupation and spend. Some of these data are then aggregated by
    geographic regions and made available to the public.

    (ABS) calibrates an index called the [**Index of Economic Resources (IER)**](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia/latest-release#index-of-economic-resources-ier-)**,**
    which scores the relative socio-economic status of a geographic region using a
    range of variables sourced from the 5-yearly Census data collection.

    geographic regions of different sizes. For instance, the State boundary (dashed
    line in Image 1) divides Australia into 8 States and Territories, whereas the
    [Statistical Area 1](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2901.0Chapter23002016#SA1)
    (SA1) boundary (in Image 2) divides Australia into much more granular regions,
    at times a cluster of just a number of streets.

    with the percentage of people of high income in the SA1 region as indicated by
    the INC_HIGH variable, and that IER score is negatively correlated with percentage
    of one-parent families in the SA1 region, as indicated by the ONEPARENT variable.
    These observations are all intuitively sensible.

    for each variable are standardised to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation
    of 1 as outlined in the ABS methodology, it may be difficult to interpret exactly
    what percentage of a particular variable contributes to a high or low IER score.
    For example, what percentage of people of high income, or properties of 4 or more
    bedrooms, is required to have an above-average IER score in a particular region?

    to ‘note down’ the range of values which may be predictive of a particular class.
  prefs: []

    the range of values we need may be UNINCORP >15%, HIGHBED > 50%, INC_LOW < 10%
    and etc., which can be used to formulate a simple nested IF ELSE statement (in
    any programming language).

    like to bring to the fore the importance of being able to interpret the model

    for demonstration of another use case, my experience has been that good visualizations
    help greatly with story telling, ultimately adding credibility to my personal
    brand and building trust with stakeholders. For this reason, by itself or not,
    visualization is and should be an important chain in any data science pipeline.
