    series covers probabilistic approaches to deep learning. The main goal is to extend
    deep learning models to quantify uncertainty, i.e., know what they do not know.

    a powerful technique that allows for the inclusion of uncertainty in the prediction
    process. We will explore how this approach can lead to more robust and accurate
    predictions, especially in cases where the data is noisy, or the model is overfitting.
    Additionally, by incorporating a prior distribution on the model parameters, we
    can regularize the model and prevent overfitting. This approach serves as a great
    first step into the exciting world of Bayesian Deep Learning.

- en: Logistic regression is a widely-used statistical method for binary classification,
    which is used to model the relationship between a binary response variable and
    one or more predictors. Logistic regression can be used to model the probability
    of a binary outcome as a function of the predictor variables. The traditional
    logistic regression model is a deterministic model, which assumes that the relationship
    between the predictor variables and the response variable is fixed and known.
    However, in many real-world applications, the true relationship between the predictors
    and the response is uncertain, and it is more appropriate to use a probabilistic
    approach.

- en: Probabilistic logistic regression models the relationship between the predictor
    variables and the binary response variable using a probabilistic framework, and
    is able to account for uncertainty in the data and the model parameters. This
    is achieved by placing probability distributions over the model parameters, rather
    than assuming fixed values for them. In this way, probabilistic logistic regression
    models can provide more accurate predictions and better uncertainty quantification
    compared to traditional logistic regression models.

- en: One of the most popular probabilistic models for logistic regression is the
    Bayesian logistic regression model. These models are based on Bayes’ theorem,
    which states that the posterior probability of a model parameter given the data
    is proportional to the product of the likelihood of the data given the parameter
    and the prior probability of the parameter. Often, Bayesian logistic regression
    models use a conjugate prior distribution for the model parameters, which allows
    for closed-form solutions for the posterior distributions. This enables the computation
    of the probability of the response variable given the predictor variables, which
    is known as the posterior predictive distribution.

    regression model, we plot the decision regions. These regions, defined by the

    the model to separate the classes. Our analysis shows that the model is able to
    effectively separate the two classes in the dataset, as evidenced by the visually
    distinct regions. However, it is important to note that the decision boundary
    is constrained to be linear, as per the assumptions of the logistic regression

    incorporating prior knowledge about the model parameters through the prior distribution
    and updating this knowledge using the observed data through the class-conditional
    distributions. This is a key aspect of Bayesian inference, which aims to incorporate
    prior knowledge and uncertainty about the model parameters into the inference
    process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the model parameters given the observed data. The above approach can be seen as
    a form of approximate Bayesian inference, as it involves using the maximum likelihood
    estimates of the class-conditional densities and the prior distribution to compute
    the weights and biases of the model. Also, the approach incorporates uncertainty
    through the shared covariance matrix, which serves as a regularization term.

    it is not a full Bayesian approach as we do not have a full posterior distribution
    of the model parameters. Nevertheless, accounting for aleatoric uncertainty in
    the prediction process already gives us more confidence about our predictive process.
