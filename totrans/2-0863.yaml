    duration of time until one event occurs**. It has been largely used in the healthcare
    sector, with the main use case being to understand the probability of one’s survival
    in medical trials.

    of looking into the likelihood of a certain event at a given time. In this article,
    we will be looking into Survival Analysis concepts, techniques, and their application
    in Python.

    duration, the dataset needs to be the **observation of individual objects**, containing
    the **event occurrence** (binary of yes/no) and the **duration** of observation.
  id: totrans-30

- en: The data also needs to be factored in for ***censorship***. Censorship happens
    when the survival duration, or **time until the event, is only partially known**
    (i.e. unknown start date or unknown end date or both). The most common type is
    ***right censorship***, which is when **the event hasn’t occurred at the end of
    observation**/analysis time (survival time is greater than the observed duration).
    We’re good to work with Survival Analysis as long as (1) the censored data is
    within an acceptable proportion (< 50%) and (2) the censorship is non-informative
    and random (has no impact on survival).
