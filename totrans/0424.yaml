    of the Data Science community.

    but not all the clever code that lies behind it, then you can re-code it all in
    Streamlit or Dash, or construct a web application with Flask or Django.
  prefs: []

    web app. You can add widgets such as sliders and select boxes and produce a fully
    interactive application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s all 100% Python and quite straightforward and, although the result is rather
    less sophisticated than you might achieve with other tools, if you are looking
    for a simple solution it’s worth looking at.

    widgets — a slider and a select box; and a main window that contains the output

    over a period of time. The slider in the sidebar is used to select the correct
    year.

    a web app from code that you had already written with Jupyter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been a lot of distractions over that year (PyScript, Streamlit, and
    some AI app that everyone seems to be talking about) but I’ve finally got around
    to looking again at Mercury and there have been a few changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main one is that version 2 boasts widgets that support interaction with
    an app. These replace the somewhat clunky YAML definitions from version 1 and,
    unlike in version 1, they can be operated in the Jupyter Notebook as well as the
    app.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: On the first line, we see an output widget `mr.Note` that simply displays Markdown
    text. Here we are using it to prompt the user to select a year from the slider.
    We then calculate the range of years from the data and use those values to display
    a slider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with a default value, then the max and min values, a label and finally step value.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The value that is returned from the widget is actually a widget object. To get
    the value from that object we have to use the `.value` attribute, as we shall
    see below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last line is another markdown string — a line that will separate the slider
    from the widget below it.
  prefs: []

    and a simple slider that is fully operational and will change value as you would
    expect.

    you will get results that correspond to the default values of the widgets. To
    change the widget values and get the corresponding charts with the new values,
    you need to run the notebook one cell at a time.

    creates a file called *welcome.md* that contains a welcoming message. Although
    these are useful for the beginner, for clarity and simplicity, I have deleted
    the notebooks from my notebook folder and removed all the content from *welcome.md*.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The downside is that a Mercury app always has the same layout — a sidebar that
    contains the widgets and a main window where the results of the code are shown.
    Furthermore, the main window has a simple linear layout that cannot be changed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not very flexible and while quite adequate for many purposes, you can
    create much more sophisticated layouts with alternative app builders such as Streamlit
    or Dash.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All in all, though, if you are happy writing Python in Jupyter Notebooks, the
    learning curve for Mercury is pretty negligible. And, while the result is not as flexible as other app builders,
    converting to an app is as simple as typing a command in a terminal window.
