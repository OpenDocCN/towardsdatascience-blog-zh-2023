    the data in such a way that you can easily spot any anomalies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    For example, the interquartile range (IQR) can be used to identify values that
    deviate significantly from the mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interquartile range (IQR) is defined as the difference between the third
    quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of the dataset. **Outliers are defined
    as values outside the IQR range multiplied by a coefficient typically of 1.5.**

    metrics to identify anomalies.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a value deviates from the mean in terms of standard deviations**.

    standard deviation. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations the original

    considered an outlier.

    data. This can be useful when working with very large and complex datasets, where
    data visualization is not enough to spot anomalies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, one option is to use the **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
    Applications with Noise (DBSCAN**) algorithm, which is a clustering algorithm
    that can identify groups of data based on their density and locate any points
    that don‚Äôt belong to any clusters. These points are considered as outliers.

    and fits it to the data. Then identify outliers as those values that don‚Äôt belong
    to any cluster, i.e. those that are labeled as -1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is just one of many clustering techniques that can be used to identify
    anomalies. For example, a method based on deep learning relies on *autoencoders*
    particular neural networks that exploit a compressed representation of the data
    to identify distinctive features in the input data.
