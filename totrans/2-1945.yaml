    ML Engineer, and MLOps. Let’s assume the purpose of extracting this data is to
    inform young learners about the most in-demand AI/Data-related roles. You could
    argue that the data's pure numerical/textual representation fails to convey the
    intended message effectively. Simply kept, it’s impossible to determine which
    job title is in demand by observing the tabular representation of the data without
    performing some statistical analysis.

    space plays a key role in structuring information to drive key points. For example,
    with the intentional spacing of the presentation component, controlling the audience's

  prefs: []

    you want the audience to remember and leave with. Structuring with space allows
    for key information to be focal points for attention. You can achieve conciseness
    and comprehensiveness by omitting clutter from presentations and visualizations
    that support data storytelling. Remove any redundant information that doesn’t
    add value.
