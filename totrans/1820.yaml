- en: Big data analytics has given organisations the power to deliver a hyper-personalised
    service to customers based on how they think, feel, and act. With the emergence
    of the promise of one-to-one targeting, segmentations can seem crude and outmoded.
    However, when used correctly, segmentations still represent a potential source
    of enormous competitive advantage as a means of listening to customers and understanding
    their needs and desires.

    of individuals or groups of individuals (*for example:* other organisations/groups
    etc.) — a number which can vary from hundreds *(for business to business service
    organisations)* to millions *(for retailers / CPGs)* and sometimes to billions
    *(for social media platforms).*

    one-size-fits-all approach**; which is grouping the customer base into manageable

    of interest while the customers across segments are different enough on the same
    characteristics of interest.

- en: The first key to a successful implementation of customer segmentation is to
    be really clear about **what it’s to be used for and then to ensure it is adequate
    for the job**. A key step especially for proposition development is to develop
    a clear idea in one’s mind of what is important to customers in different segments,
    something that is much easier if we concentrate attention on a single segmentation
    as a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive means of customer classification.

    as the customer is interacting with your product and services. Every detail like
    a click, a page-view, time-spent on a page, addition to / removal from carts,
    discounts used, purchases etc. is recorded. ***Although very rich in itself, the
    behaviour data is not able to capture the “feelings” of customers such as desires
    and frustrations.***
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This kind of information is usually **captured from the data collected by surveying
    your customers with questionnaires** which allow you to delve into not only how
    a customer feels about their current environment but also what they wish could
    be better — which together can be turned into a strategic segmentation for the
    organisation.
  prefs: []

    the small sample of customers for which we have both pieces of information. **We
    can use Machine Learning techniques to model out the survey-based segmentations

    by the key decision-makers. **They need to understand it, buy in to it and live
    by it for the right use cases.** Being in an office HQ with little or no interaction
    with customers, a key benefit of good segmentation is helping decision-makers
    get closer to their customers through stories illustrated with images, videos,
    quotations and not so many numbers.

    to make better decisions is by helping to tell a memorable story about customers.
