    informing how data can be conveyed visually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, with this maturity has come the mundane. Most visualisation today
    is a monotonous, status quo of charts with originality shunned in favour of tried-and-tested
    methods.
  prefs: []

    the contrasting length of bars[3], how can we avoid everything becoming a bar
    chart?

    and [3D](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/when-to-use-3d-in-data-visualisation-f3739e320da7)

    that should engage and stimulate. Creating something new, different and original
    is key. True originality is hard[4] but essential to continued development of
    data visualisation.

    We will look towards the film industry for inspiration; bringing special effects
    tools and data together to create something different.

- en: Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suite. It can be used to create
    a wide range of computer generated content, including the special effects for
    a number of [blockbuster films](https://inspirationtuts.com/blender-movies-top-movies-made-with-blender-3d/).

- en: What makes Blender particularly interesting when it comes to data science and
    data visualisation, is that it has **a complete Python API** that can be used
    to build visualisations programmatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This unlocks almost unlimited possibilities. A single Python workflow can be
    used to process data and then create powerful, realistic 3D renderings based on
    that data using Blender!

    the status quo in data visualisation and inject excitement and originality into
    content by borrowing techniques and tools outside of Data Science.
