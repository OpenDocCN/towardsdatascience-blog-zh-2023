    I explained the fundamental ideas behind some statistical concepts, including
    different definitions relating to population and sample, sampling methods, and
    confidence interval. Today, I will provide you with additional explanations of
    several frequently encountered statistical topics. Hopefully, this is a simple
    tutorial even for those who are not familiar with statistics.'

    data is. The median and mean are not designed for this since they simply reveal
    the range in which the majority of your data values fall.

    In this section, I’ll bring my lemon farm up once again. Each year, my family
    has to harvest lemons twice in January and September. The distribution of the
    lemons’ weights for each harvest season is shown below. At the first glance, we
    can see the average weights of lemons for both harvest seasons are about the same.
    However, it seems that the weight distribution of January lemons is more spread
    out than that of lemons picked in September. In other words, though the lemons
    harvested in both months have similar weights, those harvested in January have
    more variability. ***So having the same central tendency doesn’t indicate similar
    degrees of variability or vice versa.***

    evaluate the quality of lemons between two harvesting seasons and alter the cultivation
    methods in January to yield more comparable products.

    look at 4 indicators: range, standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range.'
  prefs: []

- en: Range
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the simplest measure of variability and is computed as the difference
    between the smallest and largest item.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in the January harvest, the heaviest lemon weighs 13g, and the
    smallest one weighs only 2g. This means the weight varies from 2g to 13g, and
    the weight range of those lemons is 11g.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite its simplicity, the range is rarely used as the single measure for variability.
    The reason is range cannot take all data points into consideration. Look at figure
    2 below, you can see that both ranges in 2 cases are 13–5=8g. However, the distributions
    of weights between those 2 are completely different. That’s why knowing only the
    range doesn't tell you anything about how the data disperse.

- en: When comparing the dispersion of 2 different data sets with roughly the same
    average, the standard deviation is helpful since it tells us how far apart on
    average each data point is from the mean. The data set with a smaller standard
    deviation is closely concentrated around the mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there are some caveats when using standard deviation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***First, the standard deviation needs to be evaluated with reference to the
    mean***. For instance, when comparing weights between pigs, 500g is not a big
    difference. However, the story is not the same with lemons. While the average
    weight of lemons is only 10g, measuring 500g more in weight would make a huge
    difference.'

    Some outliers might increase the standard deviation and make the dispersion appear
    larger than normal. ***This leads to my third point, which is standard deviation
    is preferred when the data is a normal distribution.***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variance is computed by squaring the standard deviation. Higher variance means
    the data is more dispersed. Variance might be more challenging to comprehend intuitively,
    but without a doubt, it is an essential metric used in [statistical tests](/summarizing-different-types-of-statistical-univariate-tests-801c7e8921c7),
    such as ANOVA, to test the difference between data sets.

    values, or is measured at the ordinal level, it would be preferable to use the
    interquartile range.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the data values are sorted in ascending order, the Q1 (a.k.a the first
    quartile) is the value at which 25% of the data values are smaller or below. Similarly,
    the value that 75% of data fall below is known as the third quartile (Q3). IQR
    is then the difference between Q3 and Q1.

- en: Suppose the September lemons and January lemons my farm produced have the same
    weight median. However, as you can see in Fig 5 below, the weight IQR of the January
    harvest is greater than September’s. Therefore, this suggests that the lemons
    picked in January vary significantly while the lemons harvested in September are
    more similar in weight.

    that mean?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assume that my family wants to check the weights of lemons in September. However,
    we cannot weigh all of them because it wastes too much time. We decided to randomly
    select 4 samples to evaluate the weight. For each batch, we carefully weigh each
    of the lemons and come up with the mean lemon weight for each batch. As a result,
    we have a total of 4 means, which correspond to 4 batches. Then, we calculate
    the average of these 4 means. The standard deviation of the mean weight values
    is defined as **the standard error**.To put it in another way, **standard error
    hints at how the means are varied** if we selected 4 random samples of lemons
    to evaluate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you may know from my previous post, sampling error always exists. Therefore,
    by knowing the standard error, you can assess how much your sample represents
    the population and then draw reliable insights. **A low standard error indicates
    that sample means are close to the population mean, suggesting well-represented
    samples, and vice versa.**

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coefficient of Variation (CV) can be understood simply as a measure of relative
    variability. It is determined by putting the standard deviation into consideration
    with the scale of the data. Why do I say this? Let’s take a very simple example
    here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose I have 2 data sets A and B as below. For each dataset, I can easily
    compute the mean and standard deviation. It appears that these 2 data have the
    same standard deviation. However, does it mean that these 2 data sets should have
    a similar spread of data? The answer is no.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Look at list A, you can see that the maximum value is 10 times greater than
    the smallest one. Meanwhile, in list B, the maximum value is only 1.009 times
    bigger than the minimum value. So, it’s obvious that data points in list B will
    be closer to each other than data points in group A. In this case, the standard
    deviation is no longer helpful since it is computed in absolute terms. We need
    another measure that will take the scale of the dataset into account, and that
    is CV.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CV is calculated by getting the standard deviation divided by the mean. The
    CV of A is 0.94, while the CV of B is only 0.004\. The CV of B is much smaller
    than that of A. Clearly, this result shows us a completely different picture than
    the standard deviation.
