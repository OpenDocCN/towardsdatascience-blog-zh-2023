    Geospatial Data Analysis with QGIS](/a-practical-introduction-to-geospatial-data-analysis-using-qgis-a6f82105b30e?sk=e6251697a54bc62fa33bc6a9a81258a7).
    In the previous article, I introduce the magic world of geospatial data analysis,
    which is a subfield of data science that involves the manipulation and extrapolation
    of information from a special type of data, called geospatial data.
  prefs: []

- en: Different from the normal data, each row of the geospatial data corresponds
    to a specific location and can be drawn on a map. The simplest case is the specific
    data point with the location described just by latitude and longitude, but there
    can be more complex features, like roads, rivers, boundaries of countries, and
    morphology, where a pair of coordinates is not enough anymore.

- en: This time I am focusing on understanding better what is [OpenStreet](https://www.openstreetmap.org/),
    the concepts behind it, and how to download the data. First of all, **OpenStreetMap**
    is the biggest free and editable geographic database and project, to which any
    person can contribute, even you since you know now the existence of this map of
    the world. It is also known as the Wikipedia of the mapping world since they are
    both maintained by volunteers from all over the world. Is this capturing your
    attention? Let’s get started!

    and **relations**. The most simple data type is the node, which is described by
    a pair of coordinates, latitude and longitude. Examples of nodes are restaurants,
    pubs, shops, libraries, banks, museums, and so on.'

    can see from the left sidebar. If you try to select different features from the
    map, it’s also possible to notice that every real-world feature has **tags**,
    that describe the geographic attributes of that feature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like a Python dictionary, it is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys
    specify correspond to properties of the node, way, or relation. In the example,
    the properties of the Unicredit bank are amenity, atm, and name. In particular,
    **amenity** is typically used to specify the type of facility used by residents
    and tourists, such as cafes, schools, bars and restaurants.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it’s time to talk about the **way**, that is represented as a collection
    of nodes. A way can be a **linear feature** or a **polygon feature**. When we
    deal with linear features, there is always a starting node and an ending node.
    Common examples are roads and train railways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The other case is the polygon feature, where the first and the last node coincide.
    In the polygon feature, there are two possible types: big buildings, like churches
    and palaces, and areas used for residential, industrial or commercial purposes.
    It’s important to note that a way can have a maximum of 2,000 nodes.'

- en: The third type of data is the relation, which is a special structure used to
    organize a lot of nodes or ways into a larger whole. Classic examples are the
    boundaries of a country or a city. Similarly to the way, you can distinguish the
    linear and polygon features. It can also be a multipolygon, that describes an
    area containing polygons.

- en: In my previous tutorial, I have shown that the most popular formats for representing
    vector data and raster data are respectively the Shapefile and GeoTIFF. For the
    OSM data, the most common formats are the **PBF** and **XML** formats. The PDF
    file is usually preferred to the XML file because it’s highly compressed and optimized
    to be more space efficient and fast.

    in on the OpenStreetMap. For example, if you want to extract all the restaurants
    in Bologna, it’s better to understand what are the common characteristics of these
    places. You need to make some explorations on the website like this, before directly
    extracting your points of interest.

    website. You have two options: you can click “Download XML” or the button “Export”.'

    library, called [Pyrosm](https://github.com/HTenkanen/pyrosm/), that is able to
    download and read PBF data from a huge number of locations all over the world.

    to get started on analyzing this type of data without having any idea of the main
    data types and playing around with the website by looking at intuitive examples.
    There are a lot of resources, but I found them dispersive since they cover very
    few aspects. I hope this tutorial helped you to begin your journey of analyzing
    geospatial data. Thanks for reading! Have a nice day!
