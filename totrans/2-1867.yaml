    science! We’ve all played with magnets before be it on the fridge or in science
    class, but we might not understand what magnets really are or what they do. In
    this article we will learn the basic theory behind electric and magnetic fields
    and learn how to make a computational framework to model them.

    It is the force that governs the behavior of charged particles and electric and
    magnetic fields are how this force manifests itself. In this section, we will
    break down the theory behind each of these fields

    field that points outward and negatively charged particles have an electric field
    that points inward seen in figure 2\. In the attractive case when a negatively
    and a positively charged particle are near each other, the field lines start at

    the force between charges is proportional to the charge of each particle divided
    by the distance between then. The exact equation is stated in equation 1 below.

    are a bit more complicated than electric fields because they are generated from
    moving charges. This can be due to electric currents in the case of [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet)
    or inherent magnetic dipoles due to electron spin in [ferromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism).
    In either case, the magnetic field is what exerts force between magnets (and moving
    charges). Magnetic field is more complicated because, unlike charged particles,
    there are no magnetic monopoles. That is, there are no positive and negative magnets,
    each one has a north and a south end that are attracted to the opposite end of
    other magnets. This means that orientation and geometry of the magnets need to
    be taken into account when determining magnet field.'

    the simplest case of magnets that are so small or so far apart their geometry
    does not matter. In this case, magnets can be treated like charged particles or
    rather a positive and negative particle next to each other like in figure 1\.
    This simplified set up is know as [magnet dipole-dipole interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole%E2%80%93dipole_interaction#:~:text=Magnetic%20dipole%E2%80%93dipole%20interaction%2C%20also,in%20calculating%20their%20interaction%20energy.)

    For instance, I could tell you the windspeed outside is 25 mph which is the quantity,
    or scalar, associated with windspeed, but if I told you that the windspeed is
    25 mph northeast you now have the windspeed vector since you know the strength
    or magnitude of the wind as well as what direction it is blowing.'

    at one point in space, but let’s say we want to know how the wind is behaving
    over an entire area. For this, we need a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field)
    which is similar to a mesh grid as discussed in our [pervious article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/simulation-101-conductive-heat-transfer-a4f09b3e16b4),
    except instead of looking at points in a grid we are now looking at vectors in
    a grid. An example of a vector field is shown below in figure 4\. As we can see,
    there are many uniformly spaced vectors with their own direction and size. Visually,
    the magnitude or strength of the vector is represented by size so bigger vectors
    represent a higher windspeed in their given direction.

    observation point due to one particle so the charge of a second particle is not

    which is cool, but let’s simulate something more interesting. How about a negative
    charge next to a positive one like in figure 1? Now we will have 2 charged particles
    with equal and opposite charges so we have to keep track of the electric field
    from both particles and see how they add up to the overall field. This will require
    us to find 2 distance *r*s from each particle to a given observation point and
    then find the vector contribution of field from each particle to [sum them up](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/vectors/Lesson-1/Vector-Addition)
    and get the overall field at that observation point.

    like in figure 1\. As we can see all of the vector heads are pointing in the correct
    direction; from the positive charge (red) to the negative charge (blue). There
    is some visual noise added by looking at observation points near our charged particles.
    Due to how Coulomb’s law is formulated, as the distance from the particle goes
    to 0, the field strength will go to infinity; thus we will get large vectors looking
    at points near the charges. We can choose to normalize them or remove them or
    just keep them in as a sanity check.

    code will look very similar. We will define a magnet class and a dipole-dipole
    interaction function. Note that different from equation 2, I use x and y coordinates
    instead of a distance *r*. This just makes the computation cleaner since unlike
    particle charge, dipole (*m*) is a vector in itself with x,y components. Also
    note that here we will be mapping *magnetic field* not *magnetic force.* The magnetic
    force applied by a magnetic field is dependent on how a charged particle/other
    magnetic moves through it which is outside the scope of this article.
