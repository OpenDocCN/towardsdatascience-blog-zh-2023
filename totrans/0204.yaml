    providing an opportunity for individuals to reflect on their accomplishments and
    areas for improvement, take ownership of their own growth, and feel more in control
    of their careers.

    to ensure that their employees are appropriately compensated for their contributions
    to the organisation. In addition, by demonstrating their value through the assessment
    process, individuals can showcase their achievements and strengthen their case
    for recognition (pay raise, bonus, promotion).

    to write a compelling self-evaluation. Realising that it is a recurring question,
    particularly among early-career IT professionals, I put together this quick guide
    with my thoughts on the subject. So here is what Software Engineers, Data Scientists
    and Application Developers need to know about writing a thorough and impactful
    self-assessment that demonstrates their strong performance while also touching
    on areas for growth to ensure a well-rounded and balanced evaluation.

    a solid self-assessment that goes beyond the basics and highlights your strengths
    in a balanced way.

- en: ➊ — Track achievements throughout the year
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Early in my career, I fell into a common trap of not thoroughly documenting
    my achievements over the course of the year, leading to a frantic search for records
    in February in time for the year-end appraisal. It was disheartening to realise
    that I could not remember everything and had to comb through multiple records,
    including Jira tickets, pull requests, emails, and design documents, to compile
    my review. This haphazard approach left me feeling demoralised, so I eventually
    started keeping a **work log** (aka [**brag document**](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents)
    by Julia Evans). This simple habit allowed me to refresh my memory and minimise
    any guesswork as to how valuable I had been.

- en: '`⭐️ Pro Tip:` Keep the stories **short and sweet** when turning your work log
    into a self-appraisal. If you are reviewing your self-evaluation and feel the
    need for a “TL;DR” summary at the top, it indicates that it is too lengthy — you
    may need to consider using bullet points instead of writing an essay. Also, identify
    which accomplishments truly stand out — these could be instances where you went
    **above and beyond** in your day-to-day job (e.g. worked at the weekend to get
    a feature over the line; evaluated multiple options before implementation, etc.).'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [Google X-Y-Z formula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrXZBkYzuZo), commonly
    used in resume writing, can also be applied to writing self-assessments. It suggests
    focusing on specific accomplishments X, measurable metrics Y, and the methods
    used to achieve results Z, and by using it, developers can highlight their achievements,
    **quantify** their impact and support their contributions with concrete data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]”

  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, a full stack developer could state: Reduced the overall page load
    time by 80% (X), as proven by benchmark testing (Y), by implementing a caching
    pattern and simplifying the HTML DOM (Z).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The notable thing here is that the X-Y-Z formula is a **data-driven** method
    requiring appraisees to quantify their achievements (using numbers or statistics)
    in order to provide concrete evidence of their contributions. Metrics like lines
    of code, bug fixes, or SLAs are typical to demonstrate the effectiveness of their
    work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`⭐️ Pro Tip:` The X-Y-Z formula is very “dry” and does not add “colour” to
    the context of the achievement. To make your accomplishments stand out, try to
    use descriptive adjectives and relevant keywords that **emphasise** their importance
    (e.g. instead of saying: “delivered the ABC feature”, you can add: “despite the
    increased scope on the ABC feature, the deployment went out on the committed sprint
    goals and timelines”).'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the beginning of my professional journey, I would have regular 1–2–1 meetings
    with my manager, but our focus would normally be dominated by pressing work-related
    matters. As a result, performance feedback often fell by the wayside. To address
    this, I learnt to be more intentional and began scheduling meetings specifically
    to discuss performance-related topics. Consequently, I could receive feedback
    on progress towards objectives, and identify areas for improvement, **avoiding
    any surprises** during the year-end reviews.

    align with the start of the appraisal period; they can pop up at any time. Therefore
    by bringing this up in a frequent basis, I could ensure that I was aware of any
    current or upcoming opportunities and could take the necessary steps to position
    myself for them.'

- en: '`⭐️ Pro Tip:` Connect your actions with **what your manager needs to be successful**.
    Do they write progress reports to senior leadership? — provide them with metrics
    and extra info. Do they negotiate timelines/budgets in case of scope creep? —
    give them enough notice so they can keep the project on track.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Successful IT professionals understand that technical skills alone are not enough
    to achieve career growth and advancement. It took me a while to recognise that
    by demonstrating a well-rounded set of competencies, I can position myself for
    a leadership role. Depending on your organisation, there may be specific **HR
    competencies** that are important for your job, but usually, these include communication,
    teamwork, critical thinking, proactiveness, adaptability, or leadership. Be sure
    to link the deployment of those attributes directly to the results you have achieved.
  prefs: []

    direct manager**. E.g. extracts from emails you have received from internal/external

    and forget to address the challenges that impacted their performance. On the contrary,
    what management wants to see is how they were overcome, or how one pivoted in
    response to them, or otherwise what the lessons learnt going forward were. Acknowledging
    these obstacles is essential for **personal growth** and development, and this
    transparency and commitment to self-improvement will not go unnoticed. I used
    to say something along these lines: “I only achieved part of this goal because
    of {very clear reason}, and I am now working on {this new method} to overcome
    this”.'

    to find a **mentor**.'
