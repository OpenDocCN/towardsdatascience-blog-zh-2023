    we indicated three Python-based exploratory charts that allow visualizing the
    distribution of a single quantitative variable. In this article (and in some of
    the following ones) we will suggest which are the most appropriate charts according
    to the nature of the message to be transmitted to our audience.

- en: The best-known angular indicator is the **standard gauge chart.** A very simple
    chart, it provides accurate information about a single numerical measurement,
    allowing comparison of the displayed value against a target value and to a set
    of numerical ranges indicated by bands of different colors. The target value can
    be a benchmark, a previous value to be exceeded, or an objective to be achieved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard gauge chart resembles the speedometer of a car. It has a **radial
    numerical scale** separated into sectors, where each sector is identified by a
    particular color. They also show lower and upper limit values and, particularly,
    a target value. The present value is also indicated with a needle or a pointer,
    or a **curved bar** moving over the radial numerical scale. The most common configuration
    has three sectors and their corresponding colors [red, yellow, green]. Usually
    red means poor, alarm, or low performance; yellow means average, caution, or normal
    performance; green represents good, satisfactory, or high performance. Red also
    implies that the numerical measurement is below the lower threshold, a yellow
    color indicates that the numerical measurement is between thresholds, and green
    implies that it is above the upper threshold.

- en: Conceptually, they are similar to the standard gauge chart. They display information
    about a single quantitative measurement, comparing its present value against a
    target value, and to a set of numerical ranges indicated by bands of different
    colors. Visually, they are similar to standard bar charts (horizontal or vertical)
    as they also code information by the length or height of a rectangular bar. The
    main difference lies in that bullet charts include a central narrow bar that indicates
    the present value of the numerical measurement being reported.

    charts, there are various sectors (three to five) indicated with colors or with
    varying intensities of a single hue. Sectors indicate qualitative values such
    as [poor, satisfactory, good], [alarm, caution, satisfactory], [bad performance,
    average performance, high performance]. Sectors can also indicate different numerical
    ranges associated with the numerical quantity displayed.

    screen space, do not have distracting decorators, and, most importantly, their

    represent categories of topics related to the data shown; for example, population
    data use people icons (See figure below). Each icon can represent a unit or other
    quantities (e.g. 10, 100, 1000). Data sets are compared by closeness using columns
    or rows of icons.

    make the values displayed difficult to count. Also avoid partial icons, which
    can confuse the audience and impair the message.

    distort the visual if the base is modified. You must also avoid all 3D effects
    because they are against all the rules for an appropriate storytelling. Finally,
    you must avoid using rounded edges instead of sharp rectangles because it makes
    it difficult to read the final numerical value.
