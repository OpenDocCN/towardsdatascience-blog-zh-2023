- en: To become chat models, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned
    on large datasets of instructions/questions paired with expected answers. While
    this simple fine-tuning yields convincing chat models, their answers may still
    be incoherent, biased, unethical, and unsafe from a human perspective. This is
    why we usually perform an additional training step to better align the LLM with
    humans.

- en: This alignment can be done using reinforcement learning with human feedback
    (RLHF). As demonstrated by OpenAI and the success of ChatGPT, RLHF can yield state-of-the-art
    chat models. However, RLHF is expensive to run. It requires large datasets annotated
    by humans and the training of several auxiliary models (reference and reward models).

- en: As a simpler and cheaper alternative to RLHF, [direct preference optimization
    (DPO)](https://kaitchup.substack.com/p/fine-tune-your-own-instruct-version) has
    recently been applied with success to align LLMs, such as Hugging Face’s [Zephyr](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta)
    and Intel’s [Neural Chat](https://huggingface.co/Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3).

    RLHF and DPO perform well at aligning LLMs, they are far from optimal given the
    datasets used for training. DeepMind also demonstrates why DPO is prone to overfitting.
    I’ll explain, in plain English, how the alternative proposed by DeepMind, the
    identity policy optimization (IPO) objective, is simpler and better designed to
    learn from the training data than RLHF and DPO.

    in a pair, one answer is rated better than the other. For its alignment, we want
    the LLM to learn which answer is preferred by humans. This is the “preference
    optimization”. RLHF learns it with reinforcement learning while DPO learns it
    with a simple classifier.'

    regularization is achieved with the KL-regularization controlling that the LLM
    gets better at each training step without drifting too far away from the original
    (also called reference) non-aligned model.

    is that even with the KL-regularization DPO is prone to overfitting. For instance,
    Hugging Face in [their technical report on training Zephyr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16944)
    found that DPO overfits the training data with perfect accuracy after only one
    training epoch.

    happens. This is also, in my opinion, the most complicated part of the paper.
    Let’s try to summarize it in plain English.

- en: 'RLHF and DPO are trained on pairs of answers with preference annotations. Usually,
    in the dataset created for this training, the same answer, or a close one, will
    always be better than the other one. In this situation, we can say that it is
    deterministic: the same input will always yield the same output. It seems intuitive
    but, in practice, humans disagree: Given a pair of answers A and B, one human
    may find A better than B while another human may find B better than A.'
  id: totrans-28

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would happen very often for instance if we want to compare two LLMs performing
    closely, i.e., generating only slightly different answers. RLHF and DPO are designed
    to learn from this kind of non-deterministic data.
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RLHF and DPO assign Elo scores for the rated answers, in other words, they convert
    pairwise preferences to point-wise estimates. They don’t directly predict which
    answer is better but instead predict a (complicated) score, in the form of [logit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit)-preferences,
    for each answer.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could say that it makes the learning objective unnecessarily more complicated.
    Indeed, we don’t need point-wise estimates when the training data are deterministic
    and use only a very small number of answers per prompt.

    IPO and DPO is that IPO directly learns pairwise preferences instead of the logit-preferences,

    of the KL-regularization. On the other hand, IPO is much more impacted by the
    increasing coefficient. Interestingly, on the IPO curves of Figure 1, we can see
    that IPO remains able to distinguish the outputs y1, y2, and y3\. It ranks them
    as y1 > y2 > y3 while DPO considers y1 perfect (nearly 1.0), while y2 and y3 would
    be equally bad. DPO overfits, IPO doesn’t.
