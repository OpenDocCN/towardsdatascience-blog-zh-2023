- en: The excitement and tension in the air were palpable as crowds lined up only
    to be turned away as conference rooms filled to capacity at PyCon DE 2023 in mid-April
    in Berlin. The release of ChatGPT mere months before set off an AI frenzy, sparking
    a tsunami of innovation and collaboration to develop the first fully open source
    state-of-the-art instruction-following LLM. During the three days of the conference,
    alone, the open source world announced the release of [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/),
    [StableLM](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models),
    and the [RedPajama](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama) dataset.

    downstream tasks when they are used with task-specific data. Furthermore, the
    most prevalent conversations among attendees were OpenAI’s [intrusive data collection
    policies](https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/), which
    prohibit many companies and even entire industries from using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)
    and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) for commercial purposes.

- en: Models trained on enormous datasets, like ChatGPT, impose internet-scale biases
    on downstream tasks. Prompt engineering, the process of iteratively selecting
    and designing prompts to elicit a desired response from a generative language
    model, while popular, simply adapts to a model’s known limitations. Fortunately,
    there’s a better alternative for addressing bias in LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this talk, [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences)
    (RLHF) is the guest star. RLHF is a process by which a model iteratively learns
    from feedback provided by a human in order to improve model performance. RLHF
    gives you finer control over LLMs, aligning model output with your specific needs
    and use case while also reducing the bias associated with LLMs. Label Studio is
    an open source data labeling platform with a user-friendly UI and Python client
    that allows you to incorporate RLHF into your own machine learning workflows.
    RLHF not only improves accuracy on downstream tasks, but it also increases truthfulness
    and reduces toxicity at minimal cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I enjoyed this talk particularly because it demystified the concept of RLHF,
    a method that played a critical role in the development of ChatGPT. Furthermore,
    Label Studio demonstrates that RLHF is a powerful and practical open source tool
    that can be added to your current workflow with ease.

    did it. As in the talk I outlined above, Ines demonstrates that incorporating
    human feedback into NLP workflows results in better performance on downstream
    tasks than using LLMs in isolation. And given my own experience with using ChatGPT,
    I don’t doubt these claims for a second. While I’ve found it to perform broad
    tasks well, I definitely would not trust ChatGPT or GPT-4 unequivocably with sensitive
    tasks that require subject matter expertise.

    information, ideas, and opinions with an ever-growing audience. [Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7)
    conducted in 2020 even found that Facebook’s Feed recommendation algorithm priveleged
    incendiary content, as they tended to increase user engagement on the platform.
    And while hate speech and toxic text detection has been the subject of much research,
    less has work been done to actually detoxify such text.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this talk, Daryna introduces ParaDetox, a novel pipeline and set of parallel
    datasets trained on parallel toxic and detoxified datasets that use Text Style
    Transfer (TST) to detoxify toxic text. Treated as a seq2seq text generation task,
    the first step in ParaDetox is to curate pairs of datasets of toxic text and detoxified
    text. These parallel datasets are then used to train a language model that automatically
    detoxifies text inputs. ParaDetox models that can detoxify Russian and English
    text, as well as the parallel datasets used to train the models are currently
    hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/s-nlp).

    we only had to worry about toxic text that was produced by humans on the internet.
    Now, however, we need to worry about both humans and machines generated toxic,
    harmful, and hateful text. ParaDetox also uses a creative approach to solve an
    age-old problem with the use of parallel corpora. This method is yet another powerful
    example of leveraging LLMs *and* human input to create an effective solution to
    a downstream task.

    latest SOTA machine learning model, package, or platform, this keynote was well
    attended, and for good reason. Although the role of data scientist has been around
    for 15 years now, most of our conferences address the management of processes
    and platforms but neglect to focus on the management of people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this talk, Noa explains that data-driven work is probabilistic, meaning it’s
    difficult to manage and requires different management techniques than non data-driven
    work. The rapid development of new machine learning techniques and technologies
    presents unique challenges to managers of data teams. And as the field has evolved
    over the years, so have the roles in data-driven teams. We have a hard time understanding
    the nuances in job titles and descriptions, which makes it harder to hire the
    right people for the right role and can also negatively impact job satisfaction
    and career development for employees.
  prefs: []

    and communicating specific definitions of data roles with current and potential
