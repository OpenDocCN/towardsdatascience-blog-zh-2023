    learning applications. From improving our models’ performance to ensuring fairness,
    the power of labeled data is immense. Unfortunately, the time and effort required
    to create such datasets are equally significant. But what if we could reduce the
    time spent on this task from days to mere hours while maintaining or even enhancing
    the labeling quality? A utopian dream? Not anymore.

    and Model-Assisted Labeling — present a transformative approach to this crucial
    process. These techniques harness the power of advanced algorithms, reducing the
    need for extensive labeled datasets, and enabling faster, more efficient, and
    highly effective data annotation.

    get trained on solving a specific task, LLMs can generalize and extrapolate information
    from a few examples by tapping into its large knowledge base. This emergent capability,
    knows as in-context learning, makes LLM a versatile choice for many tasks that
    includes not only text generation but also data extraction such as named entity
    recognition.

    companies using zero-shot and few-shot labeling capabilities of GPT 3.5, also
    known as ChatGPT. SDS offer comprehensive information regarding specific substances
    or mixtures, designed to assist workplaces in effectively managing chemicals.
    These documents play a vital role in providing detailed insights into hazards,
    encompassing environmental risks, and offering invaluable guidance on safety precautions.
    SDSs act as an indispensable source of knowledge, enabling employees to make informed
    decisions regarding the safe handling and utilization of chemicals in the workplace.
    SDS usually come in PDFs in various layouts but usually contain the same information.
    In this tutorial, we are interested to train an AI model that automatically identifies
    the following entities:'

    LLMs to do. LLMs have been trained for text completion tasks and usually tend
    to hallucinate or generate additional comments or text when prompted to extract
    relevant information.

    output from the LLM such as a JSON. Which requires some prompt engineering to
    get it right. In addition, once the results are parsed we need to map them to
    the original tokens in the input text.

    annotation tool](https://ubiai.tools). Under hood, UBIAI does the prompting, chunk
    the data so it is below the context length limit, and send it to OpenAI’s GPT3.5
    Turbo API for inference. Once the output is sent back, the data gets parsed, processed
    and applied to your documents for auto-labeling.

    model to learn from to auto-label the next documents. The app will automatically
    choose the most informative documents from your already labeled dataset and concatenate
    them in the prompt. This approach is called Few-shot labeling where “Few” ranges
    from 0 to n. To configure, the number of examples, simply click on the configuration
    button and input the number of examples, as shown below.

    itself. Surprisingly, the LLM is able to understand our document quite well and
    does most of the labeling correctly!

- en: Automating entity extraction from PDFs using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
    become a reality with the advent of LLMs in-context learning capabilities such
    as Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning. These techniques harness the power
    of LLMs latent knowledge to reduce the reliance on extensive labeled datasets
    and enable faster, more efficient, and highly effective data annotation.

- en: The tutorial presented a method to auto-label semi-structured documents, specifically
    focusing on Safety Data Sheets (SDS) but would also work for unstructured text.
    By leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, particularly GPT 3.5
    (chatGPT), the tutorial demonstrated the ability to automatically identify important
    entities within SDSs, such as product number, CAS number, use cases, classification,
    GHS label, and more.

- en: The extracted information, if stored in a searchable database, provides significant
    value to companies as it allows for quick search and retrieval of hazardous components.
    The tutorial highlighted the potential of zero-shot labeling, where the LLM can
    understand and extract information from SDSs without any explicit examples. This
    showcases the versatility and generalization abilities of LLMs, going beyond text
    generation tasks.
