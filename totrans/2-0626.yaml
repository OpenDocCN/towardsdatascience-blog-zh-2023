- en: One of the most common meetings or rituals for an agile team is the daily standup.
    It is usually short (max. 15 minutes), happens mostly at the same time of the
    day, and is mandatory for every team member to join. In theory, this meeting can
    be a great way to align the team and ensure every team member knows what the others
    are currently working on and surfaces which challenges they face. That made daily
    standups also a best seller for data teams. So far, so good, and if you feel standups
    are a huge help for your data team and make you efficient, no need to continue
    reading because “never change a running system”.

    The majority of data teams I know struggle to stick to the timeline, and other
    teams struggle to get always everyone to join or to be prepared. All of these
    are clear signs that the team has a need for deeper discussions, or that they
    do not see a huge value in the standup. Even for teams without these issues who
    have professional standups by the book, due to the short time, the standup is
    often on such a high level that it is more of a reporting tool rather than helping
    the team to do their work. I do believe that a lot of teams perform daily standups
    just because someone told them to or because they were always done.

    to about 1.15h of valuable time for each team member per week. Of course, one
    solution could be to follow the common agile and scrum advice more strictly. But
    there is another option: reconsider what you actually want to solve with these
    meetings. Following, I will present you how you can easily replace your daily
    standups with alternatives and use the saved time for weekly *team times* that
    allow for deep dives supporting your data scientists'' and data analysts'' needs.'

    team should now stop that practice. However, there might be quite a few teams
    for which it can be beneficial to try other rituals. One way to find out is to
    talk to the team openly and directly. Certain team members probably already have
    a strong opinion on this topic. Otherwise, I will provide you with a list of points
    where I would consider a new approach if at least one of the following points
    is true:'

    from a different approach. However, the question about alternatives is very much
    dependent on the answer to the basic question: “What are standups supposed to
    improve in your team?”. When you find an answer to that question, coming up with
    alternatives can be straightforward. For me, the purpose of daily standups is
    3-fold and I would solve each purpose separately. Those 3 purposes are:'

    it might very well be an option to have no meeting at all. Such an update is on
    a very high level that could easily be done offline with a virtual standup. For
    instance, we are using a [geekbot](http://www.geekbot.com) for [slack](http://www.slack.com)
    that asks all team members to provide a short update. Other alternatives could
    be to use [technical drawings](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/success-in-ml-projects-through-technical-drawings-69dd8d2744a4)
    or an agile work management tool and make sure every team member updates their
    tasks/cards every day.

- en: (**2**) To make sure every team member gets the support they need, I highly
    recommend having at least once per week a longer team meeting, something we call
    “*team time*”. This meeting should be 30–45 min long and ensure there is enough
    time to really get to the bottom of a problem and find a solution. Every team
    member can propose a topic and the team discusses it together. If there are no
    challenges to discuss, this is also a great forum for other ways of knowledge
    share. When you are summing up these costs, you will be in a similar or even more
    expensive range than daily standups, but those meetings are actually helpful since
    they allow the team to solve problems and share knowledge and, with that, replace
    other meetings and make work more efficient.

- en: (**3**) The social aspect is something that is rarely stated as a need for daily
    standups. But, for me, this is a misconception. A healthy and social team will
    always be an efficient team. Developing a proper team atmosphere and spirit should
    be key and in the interest of everyone. The above-mentioned *team times* could
    serve that purpose but on top of that, there should be regular social events or
    other forms allowing for social interaction.
  prefs: []

- en: Looking back, running standups with dedicated meetings and using that time for
    a longer deep-dive *team time* meeting has been one of the best decisions for
    my team in the past. In fact, we are having 2 *team times* per week.

    that other alternatives are more useful. High-level team updates can be achieved
    with automatic chat tools, deep dive topics can be discussed in dedicated team
    meetings, and social events can ensure team spirit. Based on the team's needs,
    those alternatives might take the same amount of time but will make the team more
    efficient in the long run.
