- en: Demand planning is at the forefront of an *Integrated Business Planning* (IBP)
    process. The outcomes from this stage form the basis for other stages (e.g. supply
    planning, production planning). This stage usually begins with the generation
    of a statistical forecast based on historical sales and combining it with sales
    inputs to arrive at an initial baseline forecast. This projection is then refined
    to yield a consensus forecast after reviewing and aligning with sales and marketing
    stakeholders. We typically track *Forecast Accuracy and Bias* as the key performance
    indicators (KPIs) in this phase of IBP. Supply chain, sales and marketing teams
    can spend considerable time and effort (and money) to get the forecast right,
    oftentimes investing in expensive forecasting tools. While it is certainly helpful
    to have a suite of advanced algorithms to improve forecast accuracy, descriptive
    analytics derived from historical sales and forecast data can also help streamline
    the demand planning process and enhance KPIs.

- en: For instance, comparing the sales forecast accuracy with the statistical forecast
    accuracy for each product and customer can help understand where spending time
    on gathering sales inputs yields more accurate results than a system generated
    statistical forecast. The sales team can focus on only those specific items and
    save time and effort, all the while generating a better forecast.
  prefs: []

- en: The analytics also help drive home a clear message to senior leadership on actionable
    items. Instead of trying to make sense of obscure KPI data, analytics highlight
    specific areas to improve as well as high performing entities to leverage learnings
    from across the business. This is highly effective in getting buy in from management
    to work towards specific, tangible goals.

    forecast generation step, historical sales adjusted for outliers are used to generate
    a system-based forecast. In the next step, the sales teams gather customer feedback
    or provide their estimate for demand, which becomes the sales forecast. The statistical
    and sales forecasts along with historical sales, information on special events
    are analyzed by the demand manager using the analytics dashboards to come up with
    a baseline forecast. The baseline forecast is reviewed by stakeholders in sales,
    marketing, and supply planning teams in a recurrent meeting (oftentimes, monthly
    or weekly) to align on a consensus forecast. The analytics are reviewed by all
    stakeholders in this meeting to establish focused action items. After this discussion,
    supply constraints (if any) are incorporated into the forecast to arrive at a
    final forecast.

    Different business units within an organization may plan their demand, supply
    and logistics at different product and customer hierarchies. Product planning
    may be done at the SKU, product family (or other) levels depending on the manufacturing
    setup. Customer planning may be done at the customer level or market segment level
    among others depending on how the accounts are set up. Instead of developing and
    showing descriptive analytics for each individual entity, it may be worthwhile
    developing flexibility to choose the levels at which you want to see the analyses
    and insights. The analytics design is also influenced by the KPIs that we want
    to improve. In this article, we will focus on volume-based descriptive analytics
    that should help improve a weighted mean absolute percent error (MAPE) as an indicator
    of forecast accuracy.

    historical sales (actuals) in the calculations. Let’s note that all forecasts
    and actuals are for volumes sold at the granularity chosen. The chosen granularities
    (in terms of product and customer hierarchies, historical time periods, forecast
    types etc.) in the visualizations below are simply examples and can be updated
    to match a business setup. The blue boxes at the top of each visualization are
    dropdowns where the user can select multiple items (with the exception of *Display
    Entity*, where we can select only one entity). *Display Entity* is the level at
    which the analysis is visualized. Time period denotes the most recent past period
    (in months in the examples shown in this section) over which the analysis is done.

    In Figure 7A, we look at product families with sales forecast deviation from expected
    Q2 sales. The expected sales in Q2 are simply a product of the last available
    Q2 sales and the average growth rate for Q2 sales across multiple years. In Figure

    It is important, however, to consider the trade-off between having too many and
    too few analytics. Too few don’t provide enough insights, and too many consume
    a lot of time and effort defeating the original purpose of *forecast management
    by exception*. The objective is to look for consistency in insights from multiple
    analytics. At the end of the day, regardless of the number of analytics, we want
    to use these to identify areas that require additional attention to improve an
    organization’s demand planning process and forecast accuracy.
