- en: Twitter has been at the centre of numerous controversies because of the influence
    of some of the largest accounts on the platform. The top 100 twitter accounts
    (by following) have an estimated total following of around 4.1 billion. We have
    seen how the top voices of Twitter can sway political opinion, impact financial
    markets, set trends, and even stir up hatred. Naturally, as a data scientist I
    was curious about what patterns could be revealed through a deep dive analysis
    over their tweets.
  prefs: []

- en: The rest of this post delves into my efforts to comprehend the nature of the
    influence of these accounts by examining the relationships between them. I will
    use clustering algorithms and statistical analysis to uncover patterns within
    and across clusters. I hope to gain a deeper understand of the nature of the influence
    these top voices have.

    the interaction of an account with their followers through the tweets shared.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    over. Clustering over a high dimensional space like this can obscure patterns
    (see the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)),
    and not to mention that it is impossible to visualise. I addressed this with UMAP
    reducing the 12 dimensions to just two.

    To answer this question I ran [chi square](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/)
    tests to see if there was a statistically significant association. The chi square
    test compares the expected distribution of sentiment/emotion if they were just
    randomly allocated across clusters with what was actually observed in the data.
    I calculated standardised residuals over each cluster and sentiment/emotion combination
    to measure how far each observation deviates from the expected values (displayed
    by the heat maps). You can loosely interpret higher standardised residuals as
    an indication that a cluster has a ‚Äògreater‚Äô propensity for a specific emotion

    this cluster. It also has the lowest negative residual and the second lowest anger
    residual, counterbalanced by the second highest optimism residual. For sports
    media, optimism makes sense as I would imagine there is a lot of promotional material.'

    a strong neutral residual. The fact that these clusters are somewhat dominated
    by news/media and not people might be driving the lower engagement.'

    are stronger in the direction of positive sentiment and optimism. Perhaps this

- en: '**Engagement Metrics**: Cluster 3 has the highest median engagement across
    the board. Looking at the box plots we can see that outliers are greater in number
    and magnitude than the other clusters. Maybe this shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise
    looking at the names within the cluster, it would appear to have the highest concentration
    of A-list celebrity accounts of all the clusters. The outliers give us some indication
    that tweets from this cluster have a higher propensity for going ‚Äúviral‚Äù comparatively
    speaking. I would caution that this could simply be a sampling effect giving the
    larger size of cluster 3 relative to the others. However larger median differences
    for engagement are somewhat indicative of virality.'

    replies were higher than all clusters with the exception of cluster 3 and 0\.
    This might be related to the type of content being shared. There might be more
    video content in this cluster for example. The median quotes are also lower than
    other clusters which is perhaps more evidence of video and image content over
    written.'

- en: '**Engagement Metrics**: Cluster 5 is a mixed bag but follows similar patterns
    to the other entertainment related clusters albeit slightly weaker effects from
    an engagement metric point of view. This cluster is analogous to cluster 3 in
    that there are some large outliers across the engagement metrics, comparatively
    speaking. One could argue that cluster 5 is really just a subset of cluster three
    looking at it‚Äôs engagement and sentiment.'

    are several.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The clusters are not necessarily temporally stable since we are only looking
    at the last 100 tweets across each account. The way an account tweets can change
    over time depending on complex external circumstances. The analysis could be extended
    to capture temporal relationships.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The approach relies on pre-trained classification models. Although they have
    performed well against state of the art bench marks, they are by no means perfect.
    Saying this, it would be interesting to include more impact metrics like irony,
    hate speech detection.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clusters can change depending on the hyperparameters the analyst selects. It‚Äôs
    always good to pair this type of unsupervised machine learning with subject matter
    expertise to ensure clusters formed make sense. It would be interesting to collaborate
    with a social media experts to get their view on the insights generated.
