    is still any debate that generative AI tools — like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Dall-E
    — are going to make an impact on the way that we work. The only remaining questions
    are really ‘how big?’ and ‘when?’

    tech teams, I end up questioning a pretty stable model for teams that I’ve been
    able to rely on for years. With the speed of the evolution in Generative AI tools
    and the amount of funding being redirected into the space, there’s one thought
    that keeps troubling me:'

    of teams that build digital products, the dramatic shift that has become apparent
    in the last few months and what the potential impact of the new generation of
    AI coding tools will have on teams themselves. By the end of the article, Technology,
    Data, and Product leaders, as well as engineers themselves, should understand
    the scope of the change and have a foundation with which to consider how they
    will respond.

    directly alongside product & tech leaders on their strategy and the structure
    of their product & tech teams. When someone asks for advice on how to structure
    their product engineering teams, my answer will invariably be something like ‘*cross
    functional teams of five to nine people, with all the skills needed to deliver
    the business outcome*’.
  prefs: []

- en: This advice stays remarkably consistent, regardless of the company size. When
    startups are in their first flush of youth and their engineering teams are growing
    fast, ten to twelve people working in one team is usually the point at which the
    team size starts to cause drag and a loss of clarity. At this critical inflection
    point, when there’s more work than the single team can handle, it’s time to scale.
    One team splits into two. Two teams split into three, each team with five to nine
    people, multiplying like mitosis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In larger companies that are scaling multi-team tribes, that model remains consistent.
    The largest tech team I have been responsible for was around 300 engineers, part
    of a product and tech team of around 450 people. Even at this overall scale, down
    at the team level it’s dominated by that 5:1 ratio — roughly five engineers and
    one product manager, usually with unique variations of additional roles, like
    data scientists, ML engineers, design, UX, agile coaches, QA and dev ops to make
    up the numbers.

- en: Every product engineering team and every CTO is different. While my personal
    preference is that product managers know their customers, take responsibility
    for commercial outcomes, scan the horizon for innovation and work directly with
    their team to prioritise work, some companies choose to separate product owner
    and and product manager roles. I prefer agile coaches that work across teams,
    but some people prefer scrum masters embedded within teams. Some people swear
    by the importance of testing and QA (quality assurance) as a specific role inside
    a team, but I prefer to push responsibility to quality for the people building
    the code and ‘[shift-left](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/software-teams/5-tips-for-shifting-left-in-continuous-testing)’
    as much as possible. Product design and UX research might be in the team, or provided
    as a service to the team. There are a thousand configurations with no specific
    right or wrong answer, and always sensitive to the context of the organisation.

    lead and a technical lead with equivalent seniority and in creative tension with
    each other. The importance of these two roles is to represent (and disagree about)
    their different perspectives. Customer delight. Cost. Benefit. Risk. Value. As
    I’ll often intone: “Product decides what to build, and tech decides how to build
    it”.'

    as the prevalent approach to software development, product engineering teams have
    usually had a product lead and some number of engineers of varying seniority.
    In today’s world, an engineer is the de facto unit of product delivery — without
    engineers turning requirements into outcomes, we don’t ship any products.

- en: Engineers don’t just build new products and features; they’re also responsible
    for keeping the current products fit and healthy. A great portion of an engineer’s
    week can be spent maintaining their existing products and systems; fixing bugs,
    upgrading versions, responding to minor requests for change and addressing security
    issues. The rest of their week may be spent on more novel problems, building new
    capabilities or implementing new technical solutions. In addition, most engineering
    teams have junior engineers requiring time to learn and be trained, and more senior
    engineers treading water to stay current with the constantly changing face of
    tech.

    our units of value delivery, product managers have equally vital responsibilities;
    eliciting the customer and stakeholder requirements, helping the team translate
    challenges into solutions in creative ways, analysing and demonstrating the value
    of the outcome, prioritising the order in which the value is delivered and then
    justifying the return on investment of all the effort.

- en: Many CEOs I’ve spoken to in the last few months have been focused on how they
    might crowbar ‘an AI’ into their product offering, with a feverishness somewhere
    between hysteria and desperation. My recommendation to them is that they should
    leave the ‘real’ AI work to people with venture capital cash to burn, and simply
    integrate whatever services OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon and Google deliver
    to us in the coming months.

    I’ll use for GPT, LLMs etc) in new products, I think there is a much more interesting

    AI is truly production ready.

    in the US, it’s revelatory to look back at how the mighty McKinsey [predicted
    the impact of AI on the workforce back in 2017](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages).
    After a great deal of research and analysis, McKinsey rank ordered the professions
    that would be more or less impacted by AI. McKinsey proposed that the *least*
    impacted would be *“Creatives,” a small but growing category of artists, performers,
    and entertainers who will be in demand as rising incomes create more demand for
    leisure and recreation”.* According to McKinsey, entertainers, just like the script
    writers and actors now on strike, weren’t just going to avoid the impact of AI,
    but would actively benefit from it. There’s a caution here for anyone making any
    predictions about the impact of AI (including anything you’re reading in this
    article).

    and I’m being churlish in referencing six year old research. Even so it’s sobering
    to see that the impact of AI isn’t going ignored by the world’s largest creative
    industry, but is actually a key thrust in the creative unions’ complaint against
    studios and producers. From uproar over the use of [generative AI art in the titles
    of Marvel’s Secret Invasion](https://www.polygon.com/23767640/ai-mcu-secret-invasion-opening-credits),
    to the (disputed) claim that [extras may be required to sign over rights to their
    digital likeness in perpetuity](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/13/23794224/sag-aftra-actors-strike-ai-image-rights)
    for later use by AI effects, one thing is very clear: creative industries are
    indisputably going to be impacted by AI in the near future.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why a scenic detour about the creative industry in an article about product
    engineering teams? Well, guess who was next on McKinsey’s big list of ‘safe’ professions?
    According to McKinsey’s, the next least likely group to be impacted by AI would
    be, *“IT professionals and other technology specialists, managers and executives,
    whose work cannot easily be replaced by machines”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: McKinsey’s view, all the way back in the distant, murky past of 2017, was that
    *“automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people, applying
    expertise, and social interactions, where machines are unable to match human performance
    for now.*” [[link](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages)].
    The problem is that GPT has completely upended the reasonable assumption that
    algorithms would struggle with these things. LLMs in 2023 are extremely capable
    of giving a convincing appearance of ‘applying expertise’, in a very broad range
    of topics including the development of software.
