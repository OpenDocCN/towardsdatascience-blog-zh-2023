- en: I came to write this article through what was a predictable yet still unexpected
    set of events. I recently finished a course on statistical testing and reporting,
    and I set out to write a series of articles explaining the details of the most
    useful statistical tests I learned. I wished to do this both to cement my own
    knowledge as well as help other data scientists learn a topic I found immensely
    helpful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first of these articles was going to be on the **t-test**, a common statistical
    test used to determine if two means (averages) from different sets of data are
    statistically different. I began to write this article, but I realized I needed
    to first explain that there are two different kinds of t-tests. Then, I realized
    that to explain that, I needed to explain a separate but related underlying concept.
    The cycle continued as I planned out the article.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, I realized that I would need to do this with each new article I
    wrote, as every statistical test required the same underlying knowledge base.
    Rather than repeat this information in each article, it would be much better to
    reference one standing source of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And thus, this article was born. In the words that follow, I will attempt to
    give a concise but effective primer on the basic concepts you should be familiar
    with in order to conduct and report statistical tests. For your convenience, I
    have broken down the concepts in the order you would encounter them running a
    study from start to finish. So without further ado, let’s get into it.

    This article is not about study design, and I won’t be going into the details
    of best practices and the reasoning behind them. That said, the design of a study
    strongly influence the eventual statistical test needed, and so it is essential
    to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:'

    “measure” before, it is likely you encountered them back in high school science
    class under different names: “independent variable” and “dependent variable,”
    respectively.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a scientific experiment, a **factor** is a variable/condition that you actively
    manipulate or change in order to observe its effect on a different variable. The
    variable upon which you are observing an effect is the **measure**.
  prefs: []

- en: 'This is easier to see with an example. Let’s imagine we are conducting a fun
    experiment intended to determine if the type of meat a person consumes upon waking
    up can influence their 100-meter dash time later in the day. We have two groups
    of participants: Everyone in the first group receives a chicken breast, and everyone
    in the second group receives a steak. In the afternoon, the members of each group
    run a 100-meter dash and the respective times are recorded.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this experiment, the factor is the type of meat, because that is what we
    are actively changing, and the measure is the 100-meter dash time, because that
    is the variable upon which we are attempting to observe some effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Levels and Treatments**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These two terms are related to the factor in an experiment. The **levels** of
    a factor refer to the number of differing conditions it has within the study.
    The actual value or manifestation of the factor at each level is a **treatment**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in the experiment above, there are two levels, because we are testing
    out two different types of meat. The two treatments are chicken and beef. Were
    we to throw duck into the fray, then we would have three levels of the factor,
    with the third treatment being duck meat.

- en: '**Between-Subjects and Within-Subjects Design** These last two are slightly
    more confusing, but incredibly important — whether a study uses a between-subjects
    or within-subjects design directly impacts the type of statistical test one can
    use for analysis.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fundamentally, this aspect of study design has to do with how participants are
    split up across the different treatments of the factor(s) in a study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a **between-subjects** design, every participant is exposed to only one treatment,
    and in a **within-subjects** design, every participant is exposed to all the treatments.
    Said another way, a between-subjects design uses different sets of participants
    for each level of the independent variable, whereas a within-subjects design uses
    the same set of participants repeatedly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, consider a study in which we want to see if a new type of contact
    lens enables better performance on a vision test. We could give one group of participants
    the initial lens and another group the new lens, and compare their respective
    performances on the vision test (between-subjects design). Alternatively, we could
    have the same group of participants try out both lenses and compare the performances
    on the vision test for the same participants with different lenses (within-subjects
    design).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that a within-subjects design is not always possible. In the meat and running
    example above, assuming the experiment must be done in a single day (which may
    well be the case due to resource restrictions), a single person can only have
    one type of meat for breakfast, not both.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, experiments with multiple factors can incorporate both between-subjects
    and within-subjects elements. Such an approach is known as a **split-plot** design.
    For example, say we want to evaluate performance on a mental health evaluation,
    and we have two factors: 1) year in college and 2) amount of daily screen time.
    We decide to conduct this experiment over the course of a year, giving the participants
    in each year (freshman, sophomore, etc.) no screen time restrictions for the first
    six months, and a 30-minute daily screen time restriction for the final six months.
    The mental health evaluation is given at the end of each session.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this experiment, the screen time is tested in a within-subjects manner (the
    same participants undergo both treatments), but the year in college is tested
    in a between-subjects manner (an individual cannot be in two years simultaneously).
    Note that this experiment is not intended as a model to follow (meticulous readers
    will notice that many confounding factors are possible), but rather as a simplified
    example to explain how a split-plot design might look.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’ve even tangentially dealt with statistical tests before, it’s likely
    you’ve heard the phrase “statistically significant difference” before. Much of
    modern statistical testing (within the frequentist paradigm, at least, but we’ll
    leave that aside for now) lies in trying to determine if there is some meaningful
    difference among the different treatment groups in an experiment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The terms in this section are all essential for understanding this idea. We’ll
    go through these a bit differently than above. First, I will define all the terms.
    Then, since they are all interrelated within an individual experiment, we’ll go
    through a single hypothetical experiment, emphasizing the role of each of these
    terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'First things first: hypothesis testing. In a traditional statistical experiment,
    we begin with two hypothesis:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Null Hypothesis**: This hypothesis states that there is no statistically
    significant difference among the treatment groups.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Alternative Hypothesis**: This hypothesis states that there is a statistically
    significant difference among the treatment groups. It can be one sided (hypothesizing
    a difference in a particular direction, i.e. greater or less), or it can be two
    sided (simply hypothesizing a difference).'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all statistical tests, we start by assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
    Then, with that assumption, we calculate the likelihood of seeing our actual data.
    If the likelihood is very low (below a certain threshold — see below), then we
    determine that the null hypothesis must in fact be false, and we reject it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Formally, this threshold is known as a **p-value**. The p-value is the probability
    that the data we see is due to random chance, assuming the null hypothesis is
    true. Thus, if the p-value is very low (generally below .05, though this can vary
    among fields and experiments), we reject the null hypothesis, claiming a statistically
    significant difference in our results. This makes logical sense, as the low p-value
    indicates the probability of seeing that data under the null hypothesis is very
    low.

- en: Finally, when you are dealing with statistical tests, you need to know whether
    you should use a parametric or nonparametric tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Parametric tests** are the more widely known type of statistical test mostly
    because the more popular tests tend to be parametric. Parametric tests come with
    a set of requirements on various statistical parameters of the data. For example,
    all parametric tests require that the data come from a random sample. Other requirements
    vary from test to test, such as requiring a specific type of distribution.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, these requirements are not always met when dealing with data
    in the wild. Occasionally, introductory classes teach to just use the test anyway
    for the class’s sake, and briefly mention the existence of alternative techniques
    beyond the scope of the class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, just using the test anyway is not appropriate in a real-world context
    where the parameters of the data do not conform to the necessary requirements.
    **Nonparametric tests** were designed precisely for this reason. These are statistical
    tests that do not require anything special of the data, and thus should be used
    in situations when the data does not behave [3].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For nearly every parametric statistical test, there is a corresponding nonparametric
    test. Thus, once all the elements of an experiment mentioned above (number of
    factors, treatments for each factor, etc.) have been taken into account, the final
    determination of what test one should use concerns whether a parametric or nonparametric
    test should be used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, it is natural to wonder why one might use parametric tests at
    all. While a detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this article,
    the high-level reason is simply that parametric tests provide more statistical
    power, and so they should be used whenever possible.

    good to understand concepts before applying them, and I hope this article has
