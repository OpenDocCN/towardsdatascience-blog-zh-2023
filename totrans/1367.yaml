    be highly regulated, complex (and somewhat confusing), deeply nuanced, can be
    very maddening to work in, and is a service that is intrinsically needed by every
    living person.

    the deep nuances of **both** the data **and** the business or inner workings of
    the healthcare system. This often means that the most senior folks have many,
    many years of experience in healthcare under their belts, and all seem like impossibly
    wise oracles. In fact, if you stayed in healthcare for your entire career, I guarantee
    that you’d learn something new every single day. This does not mean that people
    new to healthcare won’t succeed — in fact, we need more people coming into healthcare
    with fresh ideas gleaned from other industries! It just means that healthcare
    is not a field for the weary, those looking for a “quick win,” or those just looking
    to dabble, so we see a fair amount of turnover for folks who end up darting off
    to a different industry, often where they can make more (sometimes a lot more)
    money or face far fewer obstacles to seeing results.

    for those with a penchant for data — even for beginners building their resume.
    Salaries can start around $80,000+ for entry-level data analysts and quickly balloon
    into the higher six-figures for those with specific skillsets, such as data science,
    advanced analytics, specific health IT systems (such as EPIC), or a clinical background
    — as some examples. For those of you already working in healthcare administrative
    or clinical roles, adding data expertise to your resume can easily position you
    for more senior and higher-paying roles.

    in a data model can be very hard to accept — especially if the model methodology
    shrouds explainability that can bring doctors or other caregivers comfort in how
    the results were derived or what factors are contributing to its results. There
    is also a Change Management component that will have nothing to do with the reliability
    of your data model or soundness of your insights. If you’re playing it a bit safer,
    and creating risk models or financial models, you might have more success in the
    Trust domain, but you might encounter more of Biggie #2.'

    assumptions that inadvertently shape the development or interpretation of a data
    model or insight. But bias can also refer to the fact that the very data you’re
    working on is inherently one-sided. In healthcare, this is amplified exponentially,
    with just *some* of the following factors:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**personal bias:** a person’s intrinsic assumptions that inadvertently shape
    the development or interpretation of a data model or insights (obvi). But in healthcare,
    that can mean things you don’t even think about, like “I’m looking to analyze
    health inequities, so I’m going to see how different African Americans’ outcomes
    are from Caucasian and pull in socioeconomic factors, demographics, race/ethnicity,
    and disease history.” See how this works? Even if we don’t consider ourselves
    biased in any way, we still tend to formulate hypotheses and analyses based on
    things we know anecdotally or things that have been analyzed before. Instead,
    we need to focus on breaking that anecdotal bias and use data to identify the
    **unknown unknowns.** That might mean new and novel sources of data, throwing
    in inputs or features that you never would have thought of using before, or developing
    more unsupervised methods, etc.'

    only reflects how we operate and things we know); or your data may only reflect
    a certain group or sub-set of patients that acts in very specific and different
    ways — for instance, insights from analyzing a Medicare population vs. a Medicaid
    population vs. and employer group vs. specific employers are most likely non-transferrable;'

    if your findings don’t mirror what they anecdotally or emotionally feel to be
    accurate or true, it is discounted; similarly, people tend to gravitate to the
    key talking points that confirm their assumption in order to justify the decision
    they’ve already made mentally, and discount the rest. This is **very** hard to
    overcome with data alone, even when they claim to be data-driven.'

    have to have extreme attention to detail and not make assumptions about any interpretation
    of results until you understand the data and the business. It is not the place

    than understanding the data, assumptions, and nuances of interpretation or communication.

    innovator, you’ll need new and novel data from many, many, many different systems
    beyond just your electronic medical record (EMR) or claims data. And to get that
    data, you’ll have to play data explorer, data engineer, and data validator for
    80–90% of the time it takes to do the entire analysis. Which means…

    if you want to get anywhere in healthcare analytics. **Simply put, it is not a
    place for data fiefdom or intellectual snobbery anymore.** In a future article,
    I’ll talk about why this mentality will be self-limiting for healthcare organizations
    who don’t want to share — a substantial amount of meaningful data that you’re
    going to want or need will have to come from others, if you can get people to
    share it with you and work together to make it usable, let alone actionable.

    link their own patient’s journey even within their four walls — say, from the
    doctor’s office/medical group visit (in one EMR system), to a hospital visit (in
    a different EMR system), to a follow-up specialist referral appointment that was
    made, to if that person attended that follow-up or not — let alone if a patient
    picked up their prescription, went to a McDonalds the minute they left the hospital,
    returned to a home wrought with toxic tap water, in a community high in the mountains
    with no primary care provider for miles and miles, in a region with no high-speed
    internet or broadband access, in a state lowest in the nation for education, etc.
    etc. etc. The list goes on and on of where community wellbeing and healthcare
    is inching towards… slowly…

    there with the right people on the bus, new emerging data methods, and a renewed
    energy for collaboration. We are seeing healthcare embrace data like never before,
    new methods in data science are allowing for new insights never seen, and collaboration
    is at an all-time high thanks to new initiatives and programs being put forth
