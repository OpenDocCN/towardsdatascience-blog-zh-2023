- en: There are tons of training materials, courses and articles available about how
    to become a Data Scientist. Once you start working in the field the transition
    to a Senior Data Scientist should naturally occur as you gain more experience
    and skills.

- en: For many Data Scientists the natural next step after Senior is to move into
    a role leading a team of Data Scientists. This role is very different to both
    Junior and Senior positions as this will likely mean taking on line-management
    duties, helping others to grow and develop and managing projects.

    I now feel qualified enough to give out some tips. Over the next few weeks, I’ll
    be writing a series of articles about leadership in Data Science.
  id: totrans-12

    skills you need that are not generally taught. Instead, most new Data Science
    leaders will need to learn these on the job. I personally found the following
    five resources invaluable for helping me through those first few months in a Data
    Science lead role.

- en: I have been very lucky to have had several formal and informal mentors who have
    helped me to make the transition into leadership and to become a good leader and
    manager now that I am in that role. A mentor should be able to share their own
    experiences of leadership and act as a sounding board for ideas and concerns you
    might have.

    be in charge of projects, people and decisions and this can at times be extremely
    overwhelming. I found having a mentor helped me to understand how I should be
    spending my time and how I should best approach managing teams and projects.

    from technical lead to managing one team, managing multiple teams and all the

    You might be dividing your time between people management duties, project management
    duties and your own technical contribution to the team. Prioritising and ensuring
    that you are spending your time on the right things will become paramount.

    with leaders in the data science space. There are some useful topics covered including
    understanding how to elevate your team as strategic business partners, what the
    data science value chain looks like and embedding responsible AI into your projects.

    can make the role of the Data Science leader harder in some ways compared to leading
    in other fields. This podcast covers some topics that can help new leaders understand
    how their data science team should position themselves within an organisation.
  id: totrans-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I personally found the resources covered in this article invaluable to guide
    me in the transition into leadership from an individual contributor role. This
    transition into a leadership role can be difficult as commonly you are not taught
    leadership skills until you are in the role itself and it can then be difficult
    to juggle many competing demands whilst also trying to pick up new skills.
  id: totrans-43
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are a Data Scientist considering a transition into a lead role in the
    future I urge you to take a look at some of these resources now. In particular
    the book, the 7 habits of highly effective people, I cannot recommend enough as
    its principles when applied to any career stage, or in fact, your life will almost
    certainly have a transformative effect.
