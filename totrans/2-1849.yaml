    packages.

    create a dashboard, a web app, or even deploying a model into production. I wrote
    about it a couple of times and I even teach you how to build and deploy your first
    app with this excellent package (links below).'

    so many more functions to the package and making it even better. Recently, they
    have released this very cool feature that I would like to show in this quick tutorial:
    *how to embed your app in a Medium Blog like this one.*'

  prefs: []

- en: First of all, I believe it is a great portfolio builder for any data scientist.
    If you work in the Tech Industry, you may know that having an interesting portfolio
    to show your skills is a good way to call attention in the job market and also
    keep your professional image shining.

- en: Another good advantage is to present a study to the world or even to a client.
    You can write a blog post and add your app in it right after a good market analysis
    or after a written report, as a great visual complement of your work.

- en: Well, in order to embed an app, we need to have one. So, let’s create a simple
    app, with just a few lines of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I decided to create an app using the `meteostat` package, which allows you to
    retrieve temperature information from mostly any location based on latitude and
    longitude coordinates.

- en: Next let’s setup the streamlit page as wide layout, so our app takes more of
    the page instead of having all the features centered on the page. As the input
    data, I’ve used this csv with many world cities together with their lat and long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Cool. The next step is to place *two drop-down boxes* for the user to select
    the city and the year that they want to retrieve information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This next snippet shows the actual information fetch from the `meteostat` package.
    We start by setting a time frame, using the year selected by the user. Then we
    use the city selected to get the lat and long information from the CSV, using
    a simple Pandas query, transforming the resulting data into a float number. Next,
    we use the function `Point()` from `meteostat` to create an object that will go
    inside the `Monthly()` function, which receives the time frame and the location,
    creating a final object, `data`, used to fetch the data needed for our app.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE3]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: With the needed data frame collected, we will create two columns to plot a line
    graphic of the monthly temperatures for the selected location and to display a
    table with the retrieved information.

    selected.

- en: The resultant app was saved as a `.py` file, together with the requirement.txt
    and the cities csv in a [GitHub repository, linked here](https://github.com/gurezende/weather_app),
    as this is a needed step before deploying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we can just go to [https://share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/)
    to deploy the application to the web. Once that is done, you get the app’s link
    and simply paste it in your Medium blog post.

    the last few paragraphs. It is fully functional directly in your Medium post *(be
    patient, it can take a few seconds to fully load)*.
