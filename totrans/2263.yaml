    OpenAI’s ChatGPT language model [1] for creative writing. In the [first article](/using-chatgpt-as-a-creative-writing-partner-part-1-prose-dc9a9994d41f),

    There is both a free and paid version of the service. The free version has limitations
    on the number of images you create, and the images you create are only granted
    to you for non-commercial use. The paid version, however, is a subscription service
    with [different tiers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans), and you will own
    all the images you create with it. The full terms of service are [here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service).

    media platform primarily used by gamers. I kicked things off using a generic prompt,
    “cover of a picture book for children,” to see what it would create. I used the
    **/imagine** command in Discord and entered the prompt; about twenty seconds later,
    it generated four thumbnail images.

    OK with generating text characters, but the words don’t make any sense. In the

    to create a children’s picture book. I started by using the former to interactively
    create a title and plot summary for the new book. Then I used both systems to
    describe and draw an illustration for the cover. I edited the image and added
    typography myself using Photoshop. I then used ChatGPT to write the rest of the
    eight-page book and describe each image. I used it to create the prompts I fed
    into Midourney to generate the eight illustrations for the book. I used Photoshop
    to edit the images, add the text, and then assemble all the pages in Microsoft
    Word to create a PDF for the final book.

    a bush in her backyard. The girl is a redhead, is around 8 years old, and is wearing
    a green dress. She has a look of excitement on her face as she stands in front
    of the door, which is large and made of wood with a brass handle.

- en: Similar to the book cover, these images came out well, too. All prescribed elements
    were rendered nicely, the girl, the door, the bushes, etc. I like the one at the
    top left the best, but there are some issues with the girl’s forehead and hair.
    There is an excellent feature in Midjourney called remix variations, which uses
    the selected image and the original prompt to generate four illustration variations.
    I hit the **V1** button to indicate the top left thumbnail, and the system created
    four variations.

    each with subtle and not-so-subtle visual differences. I liked the one on the
    lower left because there were fewer problems with her hair, and the rendering
    of the door seemed better. So I hit the **U3** button to upsize it to 2048x2048
    pixels. I then added the text using Photoshop. I didn’t touch up this image at
    all.

- en: When reading a picture book, there is an expectation that the characters will
    generally look the same from page to page. But if you compare the rendering of
    Lily from the book cover to the page one illustration, you will notice some issues
    with continuity. For example, the pattern of the dress is the most noticeable
    difference.

    Unless you tell it, the system doesn’t “know” what a new character is supposed
    to look like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two possible solutions for improving continuity between illustrations.
    First, providing a more detailed description of the character in the prompt would
    help, i.e., including descriptions of the dress and the hair in more detail. Midjourney
    would pick up those words, and the rendered character would be more similar. Second,
    the images could be cleaned up in Photoshop, i.e., to match the colors of the
    hair and dress using the Curves tool with the eyedropper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I didn’t spend too much time fixing continuity issues for the book. Still, I
    selected thumbnails where the characters had a close match, adjusted the prompts
    occasionally, and did a little cleanup in Photoshop.

    or the arrow buttons to flip pages. Going full screen is not very useful, as it
    zooms in too much and won’t show complete pages.

    and pasting the “best of” pictures of the characters generated by Midjourney.
    I tried to use the image prompt feature of the system to automate the creation
    of the compilation image, but it never worked out.

- en: It took a fair amount of experimenting, but I managed to use ChatGPT and Midjourney
    as writing/illustrating partners to create a simple children’s picture book. In
    general, I was happy with the result. The characters were interesting, and the
    illustrations looked pretty good.
  prefs: []

- en: However, as I mentioned above, the plot was simple and devoid of details. First,
    it would need to be more than eight pages to create a more engaging story. For
    reference, “Goodnight Moon” by Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd has 30 pages,
    and “Where the Wild Things Are” by Maurice Sendak has 48\. But I think it’s possible
    to work with ChatGPT to create a high-level outline of a more complex story, then
    break it down into sections, and then generate the individual pages that contribute
    to the story arc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, more experimentation is needed to render characters with proper continuity
    across the pages. For example, it might be possible to use Midjourney to create
    a character study, generating individuals in various poses from different angles.
    And then use isolated poses as image prompts, along with text that describes a
    particular scene.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I am hopeful that the developers working on text-to-image generation systems
    like [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/), [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/),
    and [Stable Diffusion](https://dreamstudio.com/create/) might be improving their
    models to render characters with visual continuity.
