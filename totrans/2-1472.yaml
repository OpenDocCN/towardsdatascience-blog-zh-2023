- en: Imposter syndrome, frustration, doubt. These are just a few of the things I
    experienced while trying to make the jump from data analyst to data scientist
    in 2018\. In the five years since, advances in artificial intelligence have introduced
    world-changing technologies such as large language and [transformer models](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/),
    [diffusion models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/diffusion-models-for-machine-learning-introduction/),
    and improved [computer vision models](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sabbirrangwala/2022/10/04/advances-in-computer-vision-propel-transportation-autonomy/?sh=62e60f44147f).
    And while the amount and quality of resources to teach yourself data science has
    exploded in the past five years, the skills you need to transition from a data
    analysis to data science role remain the same.

- en: My jump from data analyst to data scientist was overwhelming. I had a limited
    understanding of my own qualifications, I had no idea whether or not I was applying
    for the right types of jobs, and I didn’t have a single person in the data science
    space I could ask for advice. This article contains everything I learned along
    my own journey and everything I wish I’d known from the start, including leveraging
    your current skills, how to teach yourself data science, the basic skills you
    need to master, and a host of specific (free) resources to transform yourself
    into a data scientist.

- en: While analysts have experience procuring, analyzing, and making business recommendations
    based on data from the past, scientists are essentially leveraging that data to
    create products that predict the future. In this respect, “future” doesn’t always
    mean predicting events that have not yet transpired, but many times means predicting
    outcomes on existing “unseen” data. Although data science roles require a more
    advanced skillset than analyst roles, the skills you need to master are not necessarily
    hard to learn.

    generalizes the differences between the skills and tools commonly used by data
    analysts versus data scientists. One very important point to note is that these
    two categories are not mutually exclusive. For instance, some data analysts may
    already use R or Python for basic tasks in their current position. Likewise, a
    data scientist may choose to use Excel and descriptive statistics for certain
    projects that don’t require a predictive model.

- en: Landing my first data science job required confidence, patience, self-discipline,
    and perseverance. As a quantitative data analyst with two years of relevant work
    experience, *it took me over eight months of full-time job hunting until I received
    an offer for a data science position.* I learned a lot during that time, and I’ve
    learned even more since becoming a data scientist.
