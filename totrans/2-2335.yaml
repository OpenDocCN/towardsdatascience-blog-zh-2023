    and customers. This digitalization implies being the master of one’s own processes
    and their state of optimization. Moreover, artificial intelligence is the new

    combined with AI technologies, has become a vital necessity. Vendors of IPA solutions
    have perfectly understood this issue since they are integrating more and more
    AI in their solutions. To understand the value of automation through AI, it is
    important to know the contribution of each technology in the automation process
    pipeline.

    are responsible for sorting them, processing the orders and then answering questions
    about the status of certain previous orders or about the products. These employees
    then take each email containing an order, open the completed and scanned form
    and, according to the list of designated products, carry out checks, make requests
    in the company’s various tools and then respond to the requesters. Some requests
    require validations, and the employees call the decision-makers to obtain various
    confirmations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This company wanted to relieve its employees of this tedious data entry work
    so that they could be entrusted with more rewarding activities such as helping
    customers. The Chapati company therefore embarked on a transformation project.
    As he did not control all the stages of the various processes, the transformation
    manager used automatic task exploration by placing agents on the workstations
    of the people in charge of sorting and answering. The resulting map, using task
    mining (TM), was then transformed into a graphical representation containing activities
    and associated sequences (BPM). As there is no API on the internal applications
    of the company, RPA scripts are implemented to simulate the input work of the
    employees. Depending on the characteristics of the ordered products, the system
    automatically asks for validation from the decision makers (“human-in-the-loop”).
