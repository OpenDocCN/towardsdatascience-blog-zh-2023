    The subject was his comments in 2007 and 2009 that the Arctic Sea would be devoid
    of summer ice within the span of seven years. Several fact-checking [sites](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/02/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claims-al-gore-said-all-arctic-ice-w/)
    verified this statement as “mostly true” and referred to the following quote:'

    ability to delve into the data and draw their own conclusions. In this *Quick
    Success Data Science* project, we’ll use Python’s pandas and Matplotlib libraries
    to scrutinize the behavior of Arctic Sea ice over the last four decades and put
    the comments and memes to the test.

    extravagant or rash claims that are easily refuted. This not only tarnishes credibility

    of sea ice over the period in question. Fortunately, we have access to a comprehensive
    public dataset compiled by the [*National Snow and Ice Data Center*](https://nsidc.org/home),
    a part of the *Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)*
    at the University of Colorado, Boulder [1]*.* This dataset utilizes satellite
    imagery to track and monitor changes in Arctic Sea ice.

    totals are [recommended](https://nsidc.org/data/masie/masie-faqs) for looking
    at trends in sea ice. However, to ensure we capture the *minimum* measured extent

- en: In the seven years following 2009, the Arctic Sea did *not* become ice-free,
    although it did reach a new low of 3.34 million square kilometers on September
    16, 2012\. This was down considerably from the September 1981 low of 6.9 million
    square kilometers and even the 2009 low of 5.0 million square kilometers. In fact,
    there was a steady downward trajectory from 2009 through 2012.

    beast. Specific and short-term predictions about its behavior should be very carefully

    backfire, resulting in ridicule and reduced credibility.
