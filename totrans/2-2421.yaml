- en: As 2022 came to an end, Strava, as many other apps, offered its users a summary
    of their year in stats. However these stats remain somehow limited, very high
    level and do not offer super useful insights into your overall activity.

- en: That’s all well and good, but based solely on this, there’s no way to know if
    a month was more dedicated to one or the other. We need to find a metric which
    makes both sports comparable on a same scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distance or moving time don’t do the trick as they are clearly on different
    scales for these activities, elevation gains are not comparable either for a run
    or a ride, the pace won’t do… Enters the suffer score.

    spent in higher zones gets more weight than time in the lower zones.

    mean suffer score for runs, translating the fact that, in my case, on average,
    a ride is more intense than a run.

    combining both running and cycling activities.
