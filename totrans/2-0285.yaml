- en: In establishing statistical significance, the p-value criterion is almost universally
    used. The criterion is to reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favour of the alternative
    (H1), when the p-value is less than the level of significance (*α*). The conventional
    values for this decision threshold include 0.05, 0.10, and 0.01.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with H0: i.e., P(D|H0), the probability or likelihood of data (D) under H0\. However,
    as made clear from the statements of the American Statistical Association ([Wasserstein
    and Lazar, 2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)),
    the p-value criterion as a decision rule has a number of serious deficiencies.
    The main deficiencies include'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the conventional values of *α* (such as 0.05) are arbitrary with little scientific

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the consequences is that the p-value criterion frequently rejects H0
    when it is violated by a practically negligible margin. This is especially so
    when the sample size is large or massive. This situation occurs because, while
    the p-value is a decreasing function of sample size, its threshold (*α*) is fixed
    and does not decrease with sample size. On this point, [Wasserstein and Lazar
    (2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)) strongly
    recommend that the p-value be supplemented or even replaced with other alternatives.
