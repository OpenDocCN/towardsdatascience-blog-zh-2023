    gradually lost steam and faded into the background little by little. Still, there
    never was a kind of “reckoning” about why it was so… until now that the Semantic
    Web vision has to consider the presence of the disruptive and flashy Generative
    AI technology.

    is an essential piece of the Web puzzle, even coexisting with the new Generative

- en: Sir [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) (TimBL)
    proposed the concept of the Semantic Web (SW) in 1999 while he was working at
    the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/). The idea was to create
    a web of data that machines could process, allowing them to understand the meaning
    of the information and make connections between different pieces of data.
  prefs: []

    he was already a worldwide (no pun intended) celebrity as the creator of the World
    Wide Web long ago.

    to make the Web a reality to his boss, Mike Sendall, who found the proposal “vague
    but exciting.” TimBL said he invented almost nothing because the hyperlinks, the
    internet protocols, and many other elements were already available. Still, nobody
    had taken the step of putting them all together in place.

    until then been focused on linking documents together. With the SW, the focus
    would shift to connecting data, creating a more intelligent and interconnected
    web.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The vision of the SW was to enable machines to understand the meaning of information
    on the Web and to use that understanding to provide more intelligent and personalized
    services to users. By the turn of the century, it was clear that the Web was not
    only for human consumption, but the way information was stored in web pages didn’t
    help at all to automate information use. According to TimBL, the traditional web
    was becoming a kind of bottleneck to Web processing automation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'That vision was compelling: Unlike the traditional Web, where pages are designed
    to present information to humans, self-describing web pages would make it possible
    to automate its content processing. So it made a lot of sense to thoroughly overhaul
    the internet as we knew it. And exactly as he did for the Web, TimBL called for
    starting the new revolution.'

    made of structured information following the standards mentioned in the table
    above, were undertaken. It contains more than 228 million entities, which looked
    like a lot when we were not used to talking about billions, like the number of
    nodes in Large Language Models (see below).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DBpedia is similar to the “Knowledge Graph” of Google, which was (and is) used
    for solving search queries. Google’s Knowledge Graph is a network of concepts
    and names expressed as a collection of RDF triples. I can’t give you much more
    information about it, as it’s mostly Google’s internal information. I’m sure the
    Knowledge Graph has been instrumental in providing Google an advantage over its
    competitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, I’m sure you have noticed that sometimes Google retrieves pages
    where your keywords don’t appear but are somehow related to your query. This is
    because of “*Semantic Search*.” This search goes beyond simple keyword matching
    by incorporating terms in the Knowledge Graph related to your query. Semantic
    Search considers synonyms and other concept relations to enrich the search.

    will be around long because they are part of the existing infrastructure. In fact,
    [they are part of the Amazon Web Services offering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/get-started-graph-sparql.html).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the Spring of this year, I have been discussing with colleagues how Bing
    used the Knowledge Graph to answer questions (yes, Microsoft also has its version
    of the Knowledge Graph). Then I saw a technical diagram of Bing, and it became
    clear how they do it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here it goes:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a query is presented to Bing, they use it to retrieve the relevant parts
    of the Knowledge graph. The result is similar to a set of statements that complement
    the original user query. This “enriched” query is then used as a prompt to ChatGPT
    or whatever Large Language Model is used. That’s it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The information coming from the Knowledge Graph has advantages over whatever
    the chatbot would do without it: the main one being that it is composed of reliable
    information instead of made-up facts, hallucinations, or whatever false information
    could be produced by the LLM alone.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There is another tantalizing possibility that nobody is talking about: AI could
    be used to annotate regular web pages and make them self-descriptive using the
    SW standards.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You know, one of the hurdles that slowed the SW was the cost of adopting it
    for each specific website. SW never became a priority to many companies, so they
    avoided channeling resources to overhaul their pages to the SW standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But with AI, it could be inexpensive to transform vanilla webpages into SW
    ones. In fact, one task at which chatbots are particularly good is to follow formats:
    I have verified this myself. So AI could remove the main obstacle for SW adoption,
    assuming there is still interest in it.'

    SW will remain helpful in the end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The irony is that the Generative AI, which at first seems to be the one that
    would put the last nail in the coffin of the SW, could end up making a kind of
    symbiosis with it and make it relevant again. They are cooperating in applications
    like the new Web search with Generative AI and could continue to cooperate in
    the future.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is a resounding “yes,” but not as TimBL originally intended it, that is, as a
    whole Web overhaul, but mainly as a support for other systems, which is less glamorous
    indeed. But equally useful.

    doesn’t foster brilliant ideas but convenient ones.'
