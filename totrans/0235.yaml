    a data standpoint, business acumen can be defined as the ability to understand
    business problems and solve that with data. Essentially, the business should be
    able to link the solutions to the effect.

    what a Data Analytics Consultant really needs is confidence, good storytelling
    (communication) skills, and a good sense of humor.

    across a process, with data and information put together, to present broader implications.
    The sooner you learn storytelling with data, the easier it gets to understand
    what the business needs and demands and how to interface with the executives (make
    people your front-row cheerleaders).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With storytelling, you are the director of your story and can cater to the audience
    as you want — from extremely technical (citing the accuracy of your data models
    or why predictive models are not fitted) to using a business language (the why,
    what, how, where and when). Communicating your content to your audience is a highly
    valued skill for a Data Analytics Consultant.
