    subreddits that is along the lines of “Paying for cloud services is just renting
    someone else’s computer.” While I do think cloud computing and storage can be
    extremely useful, this article will focus on some of the reasons why I’ve moved
    my analyses, data stores, and tools away from the online providers, and into my
    home office. [A link to the tools and hardware](http://www.willkeefe.com) I used
    to do this is available as well.

    problem I ran into. While I’m a fairly traditional investor with a low-risk tolerance,
    there is a small hope inside of me that maybe, just maybe, I can be one of the
    <1% to beat the S&P 500\. Note I used the word “hope”, and us such, do not put
    too much on the line in this hope. A few times a year I’ll give my Robinhood account
    $100 and treat it with as much regard as I treat a lottery ticket — hoping to
    break it big. I will put the adults in the room at ease though by sharing that
    this account is separate from my larger accounts that are mostly based on index
    funds with regular modest returns with a few value stocks I sell covered calls
    on a rolling basis with. My Robinhood account however is borderline degenerate
    gambling, and anything goes. I have a few rules for myself though:'

    is open-sourced through resources such as [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
    (an example of mine is below), derivative historical datasets are much more expensive
    and difficult to come by. Some initial glances at the APIs available provided
    hints that regular, routine access to data to backtest strategies for my portfolio
    could cost me hundreds of dollars **annually**, and possibly even **monthly**

    I use daily in my work. I created a personal AWS account, and wrote Python scripts
    to deploy on Lambda to scrape free, live option datasets at predetermined intervals
    and write the data on my behalf. This was a fully automated system, and near-infinitely
    scalable because a different scraper would be dynamically spun up for every ticker
    in my portfolio. Writing the data was more challenging, and I was nestled between
    two routes. I could either write the data to S3, crawl it with Glue, and analyze
    it with serverless querying in Athena, or I could use a relational database service
    and directly write my data from Lambda to the RDS.

    write about 100 MB of data per ticker per month at 15-minute intervals, which
    may not sound like much, but considering I have a portfolio of 20 tickers, before
    the end of the year I would have used all of the entirety of the free tier. On
    top of that, the small compute capacity within the free tier was quickly eaten
    up, and my server ate through all 750 hours before I knew it (considering I wanted
    to track options trades for roughly 8 hours a day, 5 days a week). I also frequently
    would read and analyze data after work at my day job, which led to greater usage
    as well. After about two months I finished the free tier allotment and received
    my first AWS bill: about $60 a month. Keep in mind, once the free tier ends, you’re
    paying for every server hour of processing, an amount per GB out of the AWS ecosystem
    to my local dev machine, and a storage cost in GB/month. I anticipated within
    a month or two my costs of ownership could increase by at least 50% if not more,
    and continue so on.'

    price new or certified refurbished (likely due to the i7 processor and dedicated
    graphics card), my broken screen pretty much totaled the value of the computer,
    and so hooking it up as a server breathed fresh life into it, and about three
    years of dust out of it. I set it up in the corner of my living room on top of
    a speaker (next to a gnome) and across from my PlayStation and set it to “always
    on” to fulfill its new purpose. My girlfriend even said the obnoxious red backlight
    of the computer keys even “pulled the room together” for what it’s worth.

    the real fun could begin. The first step was finishing wiring my ethernet throughout
    my home. The installers had not connected any ethernet cables to the cable box
    by default, so I had to cut the ends and install the jacks myself. Fortunately,
    the AWESOME toolkit I purchased (link on my [site](http://www.willkeefe.com/))
    included the crimp tool, the RJ45 ends, and testing equipment to ensure I wired
    the ends right and to identify which port around my apartment correlated to which
    wire. Of course, with my luck, the very last of 8 wires ended up being the one
    I needed for my office, but the future tenants of my place will benefit from my
    good deed for the day I guess. The entire process took around 2–3 hours of wiring
    the gigabit connections but fortunately, my girlfriend enjoyed helping and a glass

    credit card cools off from my Amazon fulfillment purchases I’m sure it will enjoy
    the reprieve from AWS pricing as well. I am also looking forward to being able
    to build and deploy more of my hobbies, as well as collect more data to write
    more Medium articles about. Some of my next few planned articles include an analysis
    of the debt West Virginia University is currently facing financially as well as
    an exploratory data analysis of Nashville’s public safety reporting (and possibly
    an ML model for anticipating emergency events and allocating resource needs).
    These data science projects are large enough that they would not be possible without
    some sort of architecture for storing and querying the massive amount of related
    data.
