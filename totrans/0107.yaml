- en: When managing a Data Science or a Data Analytics team, it can be a challenge
    to find a good balance between enabling uninterrupted focus time for your team
    members and fostering engagement, collaboration, and a team spirit. Throughout
    my journey as a team leader, I’ve tried numerous iterations and approaches to
    achieve this balance. In this article, I’ll outline the five essential touchpoints
    that I currently have that work well for me and my team.

    yearning for relief from “too many meetings”, I hope these insights will invigorate
    your own professional journey.

    the morning stand-up is a brief yet essential daily gathering happening first
    thing in the morning (at a consistent time). Although some folks might start their
    day earlier, the standup meeting serves as a unifying launchpad for the entire
    team. During this meeting, everyone, including the manager, takes turns providing

    highly effective for a dedicated development team working on a singular product
    or project. However, its application to an Analytics/Data Science practice presents
    challenges. The fundamental issue being that team members often engage in diverse
    projects or analyses, many of which don’t neatly align with the standard sprint
    cycle — Data Science projects tend to extend beyond the typical 2 to 3-week sprint
    duration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This divergence in project timelines and scopes also meant that only a fraction
    of some Agile ceremonies (planning and backlog grooming sessions) aligned with
    the specific needs of individual Data Scientists. It became apparent that attempting
    to shoehorn diverse and multifaceted Data Science tasks into the rigid structure
    of traditional Agile sprints presented significant inefficiencies.

    It is scheduled for a crisp 15 minutes but as Friday mornings are usually less
    meeting intensive, conversation is free to go longer if needed.

    a format that could have allowed for more in-depth, technical conversations. However,
    it became evident that participants often opted to skip these sessions in favor
    of task or project completion, resulting in less-than-ideal attendance. Moreover,
    the 1-hour duration sometimes acted as a deterrent for volunteers to step forward
    and share their ongoing work.
