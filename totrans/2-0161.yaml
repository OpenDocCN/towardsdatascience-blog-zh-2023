    table, which means it is impossible to show a zero instead of empty cells.

    value.

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    returns a value, it will not change by adding 0.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of how you add the additional table, you need it to be able to generate
    a Filter context, which can be used by the Measure to always return a value.
