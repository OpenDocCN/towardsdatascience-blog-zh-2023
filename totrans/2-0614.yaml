- en: As a current Ph.D. student who decided to leave academia for the industry, I’ve
    devoted substantial time to exploring how my academic experience could translate
    into an industry setting. Initially, the two domains seemed to stand at opposite
    ends of the spectrum. However, after extensive research and discussions with many
    who’ve traversed the path from academia to industry, I found more parallels than
    I anticipated. In this blog post, I’ll share my insights about the differences,
    and commonalities between academic and industrial data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I should note that lacking firsthand industry experience, my comparisons between
    industry and academia rely on insights from others who have traversed this path.
    Additionally, I am a Ph.D. candidate in quantitative marketing and thus more familiar
    with academic research in economics and business. So, when I make comparisons
    I compare industry practices to the academic research process in these areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those unfamiliar with the process of academic research and the application
    of data science within this context, I define data science as the process of driving
    insights from data using scientific methods and algorithms. For example, I mainly
    use causal inference and machine learning methods to answer the research questions
    in my dissertation projects. I will next provide an overview of academic research
    in quantitative marketing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In academia, we need to find relevant questions that warrant answers (e.g.,
    how do paywalls affect revenue, how do certain campaigns affect sales). We then
    gather the data required to answer these questions (e.g., by collaborating with
    an online newspaper, web scraping, using APIs, or procuring data). Once we have
    the data, we can start the process of preparing the data for analysis and use
    the data to test our hypotheses. Once we have some initial results, we communicate
    these through presentations and draft papers to get feedback. We update the analyses,
    presentations, and papers to address the feedback received. This process (i.e.,
    get feedback, address the feedback) repeats until we reach a high-quality project/paper
    that clears the scientific bar.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The objectives of data science in academia and industry, though both valuable,
    have distinct focus areas and consequently, varied definitions of impact. In academia,
    the primary objective is often the advancement of knowledge. Scholars aim to fill
    gaps in current understanding, challenge existing theories, or develop new frameworks,
    methodologies, or tools. The impact here is largely measured by the influence
    of their work on the academic community, as seen through citations, advancements
    in the field, and contributions to teaching and learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In industry, data science objectives are typically more directly tied to business
    goals such as improving operations, optimizing products or services, and aiding
    strategic decision-making. The impact is often assessed in terms of tangible outcomes
    like enhanced user experience, increased revenue, cost savings, or other key performance
    indicators relevant to the business. This does not mean that the work in the industry
    is purely transactional. Many industry projects also contribute to broader societal
    goals, such as improving healthcare, advancing sustainable practices, or enhancing
    data privacy and security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both sectors, the ultimate goal is to create value, but the way that value
    is defined and measured can vary significantly. Recognizing these differences
    can help us appreciate the unique contributions of data science in both academia
    and industry.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In academia, the creation of research questions and the task of gathering data
    are usually an intrinsic part of a scholar’s role. The impetus to develop and
    answer questions is driven by intellectual curiosity, gaps in existing knowledge,
    and the potential to contribute new insights to our collective understanding.
    This process can be demanding and time-consuming as it may involve an extensive
    literature review, experimentation, surveys, or fieldwork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, within the industry setting, the origin of research questions and
    data often comes in a different form. Questions are generally derived from specific
    business needs, to yield insights that enhance operations, products, or services.
    Data scientists in the industry typically work with data that is readily available
    — a byproduct of business activities or procured from third-party providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, these are not strict rules and there can be quite a bit of variation
    in both sectors. In both academia and industry, the ability to formulate meaningful
    questions and understand data quality and suitability are crucial skills for a
    data scientist.

- en: '**Timelines and Scope of Projects**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both academic and industry projects have their unique timelines and scopes that
    align with their specific objectives. Academic research often follows a longer
    timeline due to the meticulous nature of data collection, rigorous analysis (e.g.,
    robustness checks), peer reviews, and publication processes inherent in academia.
    As scholars, our purpose is to add to the reservoir of scientific knowledge through
    robust, thoroughly verified results, a process that naturally requires time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in an industry setting, timelines tend to be shorter in response to
    the dynamic nature of the market and business needs. This doesn’t mean that quality
    is compromised. On the contrary, the industry also follows stringent quality control
    processes to ensure the reliability of results. The pace is driven by the goal
    to deliver actionable insights swiftly to maintain or gain a competitive edge.
    This agility allows companies to adapt and innovate rapidly, which is a strength
    in the fast-paced business environment.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Critical and scientific thinking is highly valued both in academia and data
    science. Hypothesis testing, for example, is at the core of the scientific process
    in academia and the causal inference track of industry data science (e.g., experimentations).
    The ability to formulate good questions, validate answers, and critically evaluate
    arguments are skills esteemed in both realms.

- en: '**Communication and Collaboration**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A crucial skill in both sectors, the essence of communication, varies depending
    on the audience. In academia, we communicate with fellow researchers, professors,
    students, or stakeholders from the industry, while in industry, data scientists
    communicate with a wider spectrum of stakeholders, including other data scientists,
    managers, executives, or clients. The knack for simplifying complex ideas for
    non-specialist groups is a common requisite.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a misconception that doctoral students lack communication skills because
    of their deep specialization, potentially struggling to explain complex ideas
    in simple, accessible language to non-specialists or business stakeholders. However,
    this is fundamentally untrue. Success in academia hinges upon the ability to communicate
    effectively with diverse audiences. For example, I regularly need to communicate
    with people from different backgrounds such as researchers from my field, researchers
    from other fields, students, and people from the industry. For each of these groups
    of people or some combination of these groups, I communicate differently.

    with processing large datasets and complex data pipelines. Although the specific
    tools utilized may vary, the principles of good coding practices, rigorous documentation,
    and efficient data management are universal for both industry and academia. In
    academia, these principles form the foundation for reproducible and open science.
    Thus, many researchers implement these principles to make science more transparent,
    accessible, collaborative, and reproducible.

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Effective project management and prioritization skills are critical in both
    academia and industry, despite differing perceptions. The notion that longer timelines
    in academia lessen the importance of project management is indeed a misconception.
    In academia, scholars often balance a diverse set of responsibilities, including
    teaching, mentoring, and administration, alongside complex research projects.
    Each stage of research requires meticulous planning and efficient task management,
    emphasizing the need for strong project management skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, in industry, careful planning, coordination, and execution are crucial
    across all stages of data science projects. The rapid pace of the industry, multiple
    simultaneous projects, and the demand for quick, actionable insights further underscore
    the importance of effective project management. Despite differences in timelines
    and context, the need for successful project management in both sectors is paramount,
    ensuring not just timely completion, but also work quality and resource efficiency.

    skills are vital whether you’re aiming to publish a paper or deliver a successful
    business project. These skills might be one of the most important things I learned
    during my Ph.D. It is important to be able to work independently but also collaboratively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For my projects, I need to be able to come up with ideas, solve problems, and
    do other tasks independently but at the same time, we need to be on the same page
    with my collaborators (co-authors). I have learned how important effective communication
    is especially when your collaborators come from different backgrounds and cultures.
    Another skill that one develops for effective collaboration is to be the ability
    to take, appreciate and implement feedback. These skills are also crucial for
    industry roles.

    adaptability, keeping pace with evolving methods and technologies. In academia,
    as it is in the industry you cannot ignore any new useful tools to not lose your
    competitive edge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, while I was doing my first Ph.D. project and using a rigorous statistical
    method used in both academia and industry. However, there was a lot of new research
    coming out showing that in certain situations this method does not perform that
    well. I ended up educating myself on issues that arise and potential new solutions
    to these issues.
