    running a marathon. Indeed, many runners who sign-up to, and start training for,
    a marathon, fail to make it to the start line, let alone finish the race. Estimates
    of the number of *non-starters,* as a percentage of those who begin their marathon
    journey, can vary from [15](https://www.runtri.com/2012/03/boston-marathon-entrants-dns-did-not.html)%

    get to the marathon start line (relatively) intact, then the chances are excellent
    that you will finish. Typically, only 2–3% of starters drop out before the finish,
    although this typically depends on race-day conditions. For instance, the famously
    frigid conditions of the 2018 Boston Marathon led to a significant increase in
    the number of starters failing to finish, with [5% of men and 3.8% of women dropping

- en: A *training disruption* is simply an extended period — several consecutive days
    — without any logged training activities. It is reasonable to expect some short
    training disruptions due to routine recovery days during weekly training. As a
    practical matter, since our runners ran about 3 times a week, then we will find
    gaps of ≤4 consecutive days per week in training, depending on how training days
    were distributed across the week. However, longer gaps in training (≥7 days) should
    be less likely and could be indicative of some unintended training disruption.

    the proportion of runners whose training histories contained a “*longest* *training
    disruption”* ≥7 days, and we compared these proportions by the gender, age, and
    ability of runners, and also by the timing of the disruption; *early* disruptions
    occurred 8–12 weeks before race-day while *late* disruptions occurred 3–7 weeks
    before race day.

    durations (7–42+ days, on the x-axis) based on gender (A), age (B), disruption
    timing (C), and runner ability (D). Most runners who make it to race day experienced
    training disruptions of at least 7 days, while longer disruptions were increasingly
    less likely. Notably, 10–20% of runners experienced a disruption of at least 14
    days, which might be considered long enough to indicate an interruption that was
    more serious than simply a busy schedule; for example, injury or illness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Graphs A, B, and D suggest that there was not much of a difference between the
    proportion of runners who experienced disruptions of different durations based
    on their gender, age, or ability; there was an increase in the proportion of males,
    younger runners, and faster runners but the difference was modest for the most
    part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The picture is somewhat different when we consider the timing of disruptions,
    graph C. Early disruptions were more common than late disruptions (regardless
    of duration), suggesting that runners were less likely to experience training
    disruptions as they got closer to race day. One explanation for this could be
    that, as runners approach race day, they become more committed and less willing
    to sacrifice their training efforts unless they have to. However, it must also
    be acknowledged that, because our dataset excluded runners who failed to complete
    their training, these runners may be biased toward late disruptions. In other
    words, the drop-out rate for runners experiencing late disruptions might be higher
    than for early disruptions. For example, there may not be sufficient time to recover
    from a late injury, compared with the same injury if it happened early in training.
    Thus, this analysis may have underestimated the proportion of runners experiencing
    late disruptions because at least some of these runners will not have made it
    to the start line. That being said, it is unlikely that this effect would fully
    explain the large relative differences (35%-60%) between the proportions of runners
    experiencing early and late disruptions.

- en: Although some long disruptions (≥7 days) are common in marathon training, the
    good news is that they don’t necessarily spell doom for race day. Most runners
    experience disruptions, yet most runners make it to the start line. However, in
    all likelihood, long training disruptions will come at a cost. Presumably, missing
    two weeks of training will have its toll on performance, especially if the two
    weeks were missed during peak training when runners are getting used to some very
    long runs, designed to simulate the fatigue of race day.

    of their training histories was disrupted and one was undisrupted; this produced

    undisrupted training.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with disrupted training) with the corresponding finish times of undisrupted marathons,
    on a runner-by-runner basis. And we estimated the “*cost of disruption”* based
    on the relative difference between these two finish times. For example, if the
    finish time of a disrupted marathon was 244 mins and the finish time of a recent
    undisrupted marathon (by the same runner) was 235 mins, then this 9-minute slowdown
    represents a 3.8% disruption cost when converted to a percentage of the undisrupted
    finish time.

    varied weather conditions, different training practices (notwithstanding the disruption),
    changes in race-day pacing or fuelling, differences in underlying fitness, altered
    tapering strategies, etc. — but the expectation is that such factors will be equally
    likely during disrupted and undisrupted training and thus become *averaged out*
    by the scale of the dataset we used.

    (A) males present with a greater disruption cost than females, for a given disruption
    duration, which was statistically significant based on disruption durations up
    to 21–27 days; incidentally, statistical significance was based on a *z-test*
    or *t-test,* as appropriate (with *p<0.01*)*,* and indicated in the graphs by

    used, see the [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.1096124/full)).
    Faster runners or later disruptions were also associated with greater costs than
    slower runners or earlier disruptions; younger runners experienced a greater cost
    than older runners, although the difference was not statistically significant
    beyond 7–13 days.
  prefs: []

- en: In (A) we can see how male runners with a 21–27 day training disruption increased
    their finish times by almost 8%; for similarly disrupted female runners, the cost
    was just over 4%. This sex difference might be due to [male runners tending to
    overestimate their ability and their tendency to run less disciplined races](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6400853/pdf/fpsyg-10-00333.pdf),
    which may compound the effects of training disruptions on race day.

    runners. On average, faster runners were associated with a disruption cost of
    about 5.5% (peaking at just under 9%) compared to less than 3% on average (peaking
    at less than 4%) for slower runners. One reason for this might be that the faster
    runners included a greater proportion of males (88%), as discussed above.

- en: Finally, before concluding, it is worth noting that in studies like this, we
    always need to be careful to avoid confusing causation and correlation. The focus
    here has been on correlation via association. Longer disruptions are associated
    with slower finish times but whether they *cause* longer finish times requires
    further work. At the very least it will be important to more carefully control
    for factors such as course and weather conditions, placing and fuelling strategies,
    training practices, or how quickly a runner returns from a break, etc. but that
    is another day’s work.

    the start line, but those who do often experience some extended period of training
    disruption, and some may have needed to take multi-week breaks to recover from
    illness or injury.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, such disruptions do not have to prematurely end a runner’s marathon
    aspirations. However, long training disruptions do come at a performance cost.
    The evidence suggests that they are associated with finish times that are 2–9%
    longer than might otherwise be the case, depending on the nature of the disruption
    (duration and timing) and the type of runner (gender, age, ability) involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While confirming that disruptions are associated with performance costs is not
    so surprising, quantifying these costs is useful. It can help runners better plan
    for their upcoming race day, for example. Certainly, a better understanding of
    the relationship between training disruptions and finish times should help runners
    to adjust their race goals and adapt their pacing if their training has been disrupted.
    And this will help them to make sure they get the most from their next marathon.
