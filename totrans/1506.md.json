["```py\nThis soccer player needs to work on their ball-striking mechanics. Their foot is not making\ngood contact with the ball, which is causing the ball to fly up and away from the goal. They\nalso need to work on their body positioning. They should be leaning into the shot with their\nnon-kicking leg in front of their kicking leg, and they should be following through with their\nkicking leg.\n```"]
