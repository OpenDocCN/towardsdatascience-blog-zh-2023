    in a variety of graph ML applications, operate under the assumption that the input
    graph is *undirected*. Making the input graph undirected has become so prevalent
    over the years that PyTorch-Geometric, one of the most popular GNN libraries,
    includes a general utility function that automatically makes graphs undirected
    when loading datasets [2].

    of GNNs. First, undirected graphs have symmetric Laplacians with orthogonal eigenvectors
    offering a natural generalisation of the Fourier transform, on which early spectral
    GNNs relied to function properly. Second, early datasets used to benchmark GNNs
    were predominantly *homophilic* graphs [3], such as Cora and Pubmed [4]. On such
    datasets disregarding the direction by converting the directed graph into an undirected
    one appears to be advantageous, early evidence whereof has helped cement the “undirected”

- en: Looking at the *compatibility matrices* for different adjacency matrices (position
    *ij* in the compatibility matrix captures the fraction of edges from nodes with
    label *i* to nodes with label *j*, weighted according to the given adjacency matrix).
    Homophilic adjacency matrices have more mass in the diagonal of their compatibility,
    as it contains edges between nodes with the same label. While in our example both
    the directed (𝐀) and undirected (𝐀ᵤ) 1-hops are maximally heterophilic, the directed
    2-hops (𝐀𝐀ᵀ and𝐀ᵀ𝐀) are more homophilic than the undirected 2-hop (𝐀ᵤ²).

    graphs and to propose separate aggregation of in- and out-neighbours. However,
    our contribution is providing a more comprehensive treatment of directed graphs,
    which includes a general framework (Dir-GNN), overarching empirical evidence for
    the benefit of directionality, particularly in the context of heterophily, and
    a starting point to analyse the expressiveness of models for directed graphs.
    See the “Related Work” section in our paper [5] for a more thorough overview of
    related previous works.'
