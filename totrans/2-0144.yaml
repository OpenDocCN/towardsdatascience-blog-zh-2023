- en: I list this first because I’ve worked on this for the longest time and it is
    essential because without measuring how well what was done, there is no way to
    know how to improve. Measurement is the compass.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to marketing measurement is to use some Northstar metric(s), for example,
    the ROI (return on investment) of advertisement investments (ROAS — Return on
    Ad Spend), to gauge the efficiency of previous marketing activities towards driving
    business KPIs. Based on the measured performance, the marketing team can decide
    to change the budget allocation, targeting strategy, bidding strategy, or other
    aspects to improve future efficiency.

    difference-in-difference, regression discontinuity, etc to understand whether
    marketing activities cause KPI changes.

- en: Let’s use Google Search as an example. Companies spend millions of dollars buying
    paid searches on Google, but is it worth it? Often people search on Google with
    a good idea of what company to choose and ad money could be a waste if they are
    converting anyways. A/B testing is to the rescue. We can use Google’s Conversion
    Lift user-level testing platform for measurement. Google randomly split users
    into control and treatment groups and serves treatment ads only to the treatment
    group. With rigorous statistical procedures, we can know the incremental conversions
    driven by ads with high confidence. Although tests are rarely perfect, we now
    have a better educated guess with good confidence thanks to marketing data science.
    When A/B testing is not possible, causal inference can also help us understand
    what would have happened if there is no ad spend and tell us whether and how much
    marketing has caused the changes in KPIs.

    approach based on personal experience, but there are more scientific ways to do
    this — Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to the rescue.

    (such as advertising activities, promotions, etc) while controlling for other
    contributing factors (such as seasonality, trend, economy, competitor activities,
    etc). The model can tell you the efficiency and contribution of the KPI of each
    marketing channel at the current level of spending. It can also simulate if the
    spend level changes, what the KPI could be with everything else controlled. Given
    future budget levels and constraints, the model can forecast KPIs and inform the
    optimization of marketing spend allocation on different channels to reach maximum
    KPIs or ROAS.

    to show when people search on Google or other websites that show ads. It is like
    real-life auctions but also considers other factors in addition to the highest
    bidding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In real-life auctions, when an object is put up, it may or may not be as valuable
    as the bidding price. You don't want to bid too much and overpay, or bid too little
    and miss opportunities. Ad actions are also like that, a search may or may not
    lead to a conversion. You don’t want to waste money on low-quality and low-relevancy
    searches, but you also don’t want to lose potential customers to your competitors.
    What’s more complicated for digital ad auctions is that they can happen anytime
    and happen very fast. It is hard and not scientific for humans to determine reasonable
    bidding amounts on certain types of products or keywords and when to update the
    bid amount.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Marketing data science comes to the rescue. Marketing DS can use historical
    marketing data, seasonality, trend, and conversion data to establish a relationship
    between the bid levers and conversions. Using optimization algorithms and business
    constraints, we can know what would be ideal bidding amounts and timing to maximize
    conversions (or other business KPIs). This takes the heavy lifting and guesswork
    away from setting bids to meet business goals.

    be in a better position in determining how much they should invest in acquiring
    new customers, retaining existing customers, and what types of marketing and promotional
    activities are likely to generate the best returns. Imagine the local restaurant
    is also targeting another person Tommy. The cost of acquiring him and acquiring
    someone like me is the same, but the restaurant has a limited budget. Based on
    historical data, people like Tommy is unlikely to come back to the restaurant
    after the first month and in total, he will only generate 50 dollars in revenue,
    as opposed to 210 dollars. The restaurant might decide to use that budget on someone
    like me instead of Tommy.

- en: Churning means a customer stops using the services or purchasing the products
    from a company. Any successful business does not want to lose its valuable customers,
    as that can lead to the loss of revenue and future growth opportunities. Sometimes
    churning is inevitable, however many times it can be prevented or pushed back
    by using retention marketing strategies or customer relationship management (CRM)
    strategies. The business can proactively reach out to customers who are about
    to churn to gauge what additional support can be provided, determine whether to
    run a targeted retention or re-engagement marketing campaign and so on.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical churn prediction model predicts the likelihood of someone churning
    in a time frame. The modeling steps can be similar to CLV modeling, however, the
    target is not a monetary value but a binary value of leaving or not leaving. The
    prediction will give us the likelihood of churning, which will be between 0 to
    1\. The features of the model can be historical data relevant to customer churn
    behaviors. Take the local restaurant as an example, last month’s order value might
    be a good feature to predict whether the customer will come back in the next month.
    Churn prediction can also be used in combination with CLV to calculate the expected
    future values of customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Models as simple as logistic regression, more complex models like random forest
    or boosting models, or even neural networks can be used for churn predictions.
    The model selection and model structure should be based on data availability,
    sample balance, model explainability, and business requirements.

    it to recommend relevant products to buyers, Netflix uses it to recommend relevant
    TV shows and movies to watchers, and UberEats uses it to recommend restaurants
    and dishes to eaters. A recommender gets better and more powerful over time when
    it has learned about the user’s behaviors, likes, and dislikes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recommendation systems can be both content-based or collaborative-filtering
    based. As the name suggests, content-based recommendation is based on similarities
    between the content of products. For example, if I have purchased Harry Potter
    books, I might also be recommended to buy The Chronicles of Narnia. Collaborative
    filtering is more based on the similarities between user attributes and behaviors,
    and/or item attributes. I will be recommended to purchase something because someone
    similar has made the purchase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recommending products or services itself already serves as part of marketing.
    There is also ads recommendation system. If you take Uber rides as often as I
    do, you will notice that now the Uber app shows ads for other businesses. One
    time I took an Uber to the gym, and I was shown an ad for sports clothing for
    women, and the other time on my way to the movie theater, I was shown an upcoming
    movie preview for the next month.

    Some customers are more price-sensitive and others make purchases regardless,
    some customers prefer luxury goods and some care more about affordability more
    frugal. When we want to run a discount promotion campaign of 20% off to encourage
    more purchases, we can target customers that are more price sensitive since customers
    who have more rigid demand is likely to purchase without the discount. When a
    new high-end product line launches, we can target customers with a more luxurious
    lifestyle to increase conversion rate and ROI.
