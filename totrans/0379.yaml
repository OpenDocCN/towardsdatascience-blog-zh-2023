    optimizations (neither for the classification case, nor for the regression case).
    However, it does demonstrate that there is a certain amount of flexibility in
    how predictions and analyses are performed, while the specific requirements of
    a school would also need to be taken into account.

- en: We also performed a fair bit of analyses ‚Äî both before doing any training of
    ML models, and also afterwards. This was done to both understand the data, and
    the trained models. In particular, we considered multiple metrics to determine
    the strengths (and weaknesses) of each model to help us determine which one would
    be best suited to our requirements, and observed which features were most important
    in predicting the outcome. This also helps educators understand the most important
    factors affecting student performance, and take measures to maximize student learning.

    in this case study already gave a lot of useful insights. Moreover, other types
    of machine learning approaches could also be performed, such as [causal inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference)
    (modelling the difference between outcomes, with and without the effect of a treatment
    variable, all else being equal).

    which data scientists need to work.

    irrespective of whether they‚Äôre comfortable with programming or not. For those
    that do have knowledge of languages like Python or R, Dataiku DSS could potentially
    make certain tasks easier, simpler, and quicker. Custom functions can also be
    programmed directly within the platform too, enhancing its flexibility and ability
    to perform more advanced tasks.
