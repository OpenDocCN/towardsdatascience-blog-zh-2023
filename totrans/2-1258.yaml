- en: In the rapidly expanding world of today, there is ample demand for professionals
    that can translate data for the business — analyze data and create recommendations
    for the business to take action from. It is all about taking that extra step to
    make data palatable for the business.

- en: Data is everywhere. The business wants to leverage that data for better decision-making
    and to be agile and competitive in the market. Now, when we say business, many
    of the C-suite executives who make the decisions do not necessarily understand
    the raw data and how to analyze that. It is on the data professionals to do the
    job and pass on actionable insights.

    accuracy of a predictive model means. I’ve heard people say “This *is great information
    but what should I do next with it?”* Therefore, it is quintessential that you
    not only analyze the data, but you present it in a way that the business too can
    make sense of.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step to solving any business problem is understanding the business
    itself. Unless you understand the challenges, needs, demands, and opportunities
    for a business, how can you optimize the present for a better future?

    The way organizations do business is so dynamic and developing at a rapid rate
    that it is quintessential for data professionals to tune their data models and
    comprehend what the business needs.

    the city and culture your story is based on — without that, you’d be missing the
    soul of your story.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your first instinct as a data professional might be to propose creating a model
    as a solution but without a clear, concise problem statement, it gets challenging
    for data professionals to translate the words into lines of code or excel sheets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the data for the task, the acceptance or rejection of that data becomes extremely
    easy. You can think of the next steps in the data lifecycle.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each department may have KPIs more critical than others because they are responsible
    for driving particular business impacts. Every time you are tasked with solving
    a business problem, start with all the relevant KPIs and metrics that matter to
    your modeling and analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An effective funnel analysis requires coherent data analysis. Start with hypothesizing
    the problem (or creating your funnel) and test those using A/B or multivariate
    testing to start filtering out KPIs that may not add value to the intent of your
    problem statement. Based on the final KPIs, now is when you start creating your
    data analyses and models.

    recognition and three being the smallest number of elements required to create

    Three Act Structure where act one, act two, and act three capture the story by
