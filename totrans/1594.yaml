    area of generative AI.
  prefs: []

    tech trend, others are convinced it is a game-changer.

    possibilities generative AI can bring to the future of education and the workplace.

    is introducing an AI chatbot into classrooms](https://uk.pcmag.com/ai/147451/harvards-new-computer-science-teacher-is-a-chatbot)
    this fall (fall 2023) to approximate a one-to-one teacher-student ratio. The students
    will use the Harvard-developed chatbot to guide them to solutions rather than
    to provide them with straightforward answers.

    in how the new generations will learn and, consequently, work.

    a way to adapt our working environments to it.

    past 12 years and gained knowledge of machine learning concepts, I am not able
    to keep up with the new developments in the generative AI area.
  prefs: []

    large language models, numerous apps and solutions built on top of them, new e-learning
    courses, and the sheer volume of posts on this topic — **all of this is** **simply
    overwhelming.**

    are now just, well, obsolete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with a few keystrokes is scary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    mind the fact that some (but only some) of my skills will be replaced. Executing
    ad-hoc queries several times per week to answer the same repetitive business questions
    is something I never liked to do.

    warehouse and the generation of business insights is just slowing down the decision-making
    process.

    won’t happen overnight.

    they need to be more “business-user friendly”, and less “developer-friendly”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is “behind the hub”. The freedom to generate analytical insights from natural
    text entries comes with the same issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the insights without new inputs (new data sources), and the technical process
    of insight quality checks will still exist.

    users.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the fintech industry, there are strict regulations, i.e., the [PCI Data Security
    Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard),
    that need to be considered when building a data platform. On top of these standards,
    sometimes there are market-based standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    regulations that need to be taken into consideration to make your data platform,
    and consequently your data architecture, compliant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the regulations are prone to changes, implying that the data architecture
    needs to follow these changes. And this imposes a real challenge for generative
    AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    level.

    where regulations are changing.

    in the Guardian. It was an article about a lawyer using ChatGPT to provide examples
    of similar previous legal cases. He wanted to back up his argument about why his
    client's lawsuit against the aviation company should not be dismissed.

    checked the cited decisions and legal citations, they found out none of them ever
    existed. In short, ChatGPT was [hallucinating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)#:~:text=In%20artificial%20intelligence%20(AI),,justified%20by%20its%20training%20data.).'

    cost you a business and lead to a complete project shut-down or losing your clients
    and reputation.
