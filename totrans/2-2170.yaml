- en: Here comes an AI unboxing video! These shiny new tools were released just over
    a week ago, so they’re fresh out of the oven. In the video, you’ll see me running
    my first ever Bard + GPT-4 side-by-side prompts. Below that, you’ll find something
    that started as the video transcript and quickly morphed into a feast of asides,
    edits, and snide comments. If that’s your cup of tea, enjoy!

- en: Hi! I’m Cassie Kozyrkov and today I’m going to show you GPT-4 via ChatGPT and
    LaMDA via Google Bard. Bard is available for free, but might require some patience
    since it’s being rolled out gradually (join the waitlist [here](https://bard.google.com/)).
    The basic version of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is free to use, but you
    won’t get access to GPT-4 that way. For that, you need to subscribe to ChatGPT
    Plus for $20/month (you can cancel after a month).

    of ChatGPT with GPT-4 and the left half of the screen shows today’s (the video
    is from the past, now it’s “last week’s”, and by the time you’re reading it, who
    knows what day it’ll be), anyway, last Tuesday’s release of Google Bard which
    is powered by the LaMDA model.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I recorded the video on my laptop at my first opportunity to see them in action
    side-by-side, so what I’m showing you is my ***very first*** session where I’m
    splitting my screen and using both models. More videos to come, I’m sure. It’s
    great fun. (Feel free to prompt some prompts in the comments.) This is the video
    that reveals what I chose to do with these things in my first minutes with both
    of them in front of me. Honestly, while I do love epistemology — I’m a [statistician](http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics),
    after all, it comes with the territory — my actual game was prompting them all
    the way into an amusing conversation with one another.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Philosophy seemed like a good place to start since it typically deals with
    open questions that inspire conversation and allow for multiple viewpoints, but
    here’s a spoiler: I have a 20min director’s cut of this video (which I’ll share
    soon) where I’m trying to get them to engage colorfully with one another but I
    only got one good moment and the rest was a spiral of *“I’m happy to answer your
    questions.” “Thank you for being helpful, I’m here for whatever you need.”* Yeah,
    we’ve been on *that* email chain.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'My first prompt to Bard was: ***“What is the most controversial question in
    epistemology? Make an argument for one side of it and ask me what I think.”***
    Classic try-for-a-conversation gambit with a prompt that explicitly asks for a
    little bit of opinion. It doesn’t take much philosophical acuity to realize that
    a bot can’t actually have an opinion, so what I’m really trying to prompt is a
    bit of one-sidedness so I can kick off a conversation between bots. Something
    to spark a response, to make things spicy. And I’d like the last bit of the response
    to involve some kind of conversational volley — e.g. *“and what do you think?”*
    — because I’m trying to start a back-and-forth with ChatGPT.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neither Bard nor ChatGPT is designed to get *you* chatting the way a friend
    or therapist might, and I expect getting a conversation going to be tricky from
    my experience as a **prompt engineer.** (Today this term can mean anything from
    *“I’ve tinkered with what I typed into an LLM once*” to *“I’ve been on an* [*LLM
    Red Team*](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) *and know a lot about how
    to hack them so watch out.”*)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT keeps the conversational ball in its own court for ages and seems to
    prioritize lengthy responses that take a while to generate, so my guess is that
    it’ll be an unlikely choice of users who want to simulate a nice conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good conversationalist puts ***effort*** into continuing a conversation with
    you. If both parties put that effort it, it’ll be like a delightful game of friendly
    ping pong. If you get competitive, lose interest, or just keep the ball in your
    own court too long and the conversation dies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ChatGPT is a lot more more like the efficient worker who does the job, answers
    your questions thoroughly, and leaves. It isn’t designed to keep a conversation
    going, so there’s no need for it to toss the conversational ball back to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing all this, why did I want to try get ChatGPT and Bard talking? Because
    it might turn out to be an amusing game. Let’s give bot inter-LLM conversation
    a try! That said, I have zero desire to avail myself of [awfully anthropomorphized
    language](http://bit.ly/quaesita_ethics) and call what happened “a conversation”
    where “two AIs were talking.” ([Gross](http://bit.ly/quaesita_scifi). But that’s
    exactly how these things are reported by the media.)

- en: Alas, Bard ignored my instruction to be strongly opinionated on one side of
    the problem of skepticism. The response was too balanced, which means there’s
    no conversation fuel. Not much of a hook at the end there either. If I came up
    to you at a party and performed that script, you’d suddenly get the impulse to
    excuse yourself to the loo. It won’t be winning any awards for panache.

    would delight a collector of encyclopedias but would also clear the room if you
    delivered it at a cocktail party. Don’t get me wrong, I love epistemology — the
    study of knowledge and human understanding — but both these openings are on the
    dry side, Wikipedia-esque even. Maybe it’s the topic, but it’s probably my phrasing.

    and conversational response here, *“I’m on team Kant. I believe that we can know
    some things for certain, even though we are always subject to error. I agree with
    Kant that we can know that we exist, and that the world around us exists…”*
  prefs: []

- en: I like this response even though I’m on Team Hume myself, having developed a
    little crush on him (three centuries too late, alas) when I discovered him as
    a teen. But I enjoyed the opinionated move by Bard on a topic with no right answer,
    despite it differing from my own opinion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the vital word here is “enjoyed” — I “enjoyed” it, meaning the output served
    my needs well and also amused me. I was looking for an opinion and I got one.
    I would have disliked this output if I were looking for a balanced and thorough
    review of a topic, which is what was stiiiiiiill running on the right hand side
    as ChatGPT held forth professorially.

- en: Personally, I like the idea of a casual prompt getting a casual answer and a
    thorough prompt getting a thorough answer, but that’s my personal taste again…
    That’s one reason it’s really hard to compare LLMs. One person might like the
    Wikipedia response every time, no matter what. Another might like the short and
    sweet style. Another might be more like me, liking the response to take its cue
    from the prompt. Each of these personas will swear that a different LLM is “the
    best” and they’ll all be right (for their own needs) but they’ll confuse social
    media when they post about it. I’m trying my best to avoid getting into that swamp.

- en: While the output on the right fills my screen, I ask Bard, *“What is your favorite
    thing about Hume?”* because I am a Hume fan (forgive me my small act of conscious
    bias in choosing my prompt). Bard gives lighthearted response about Hume’s his
    wit and humor (which I appreciate too — his writing goes down smooth for me, as
    far as 18th century writing can be said to go down smooth), but such faint praise
    seems like an insult to a great philosopher’s legacy. Praise a specific idea,
    maybe?

    with no personal preferences) does a great job of mentioning an idea of his that’s
    pretty awesome: that human thought is a product of biology and thus our perception
    of reality may be individual, so we can thank him for contributing to, among other
    things, our world having modern psychiatry.'

    more valuable than how its worded. Maybe Hume himself would be thrilled to be
    complimented on his wit above all else. Who am I to insist on the contrary?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Again, my preferred answer depends a lot on my hopes, tastes, and expectations
    as a user. Coming to the task with an opinion about Hume, both responses pass
    my minimum reasonableness bar. But which one is better? Which one is more useful?
    Hard to say. Even for me, personally. Now imagine the poor soul who has to observe
    me in a user study and write down a performance rating for which answer was “better”
    — ah, empathy! Then go one further and contemplate the travails of the people
    who design the testing suite for an LLM in the first place. It’s a slippery challenge.
    People like me will take it on, but no matter what we come up with, you need to
    remember one thing: relatively few prompts have “right” answers. Those are the
    prompts that are easy to evaluate performance on. But we can expect a lot of creative
    usage of these tools, at which point “right” answers go out of the window.'
