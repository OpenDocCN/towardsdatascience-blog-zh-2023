- en: Different types of visualizations exist to communicate different messages. For
    instance, histograms are used to measure the distribution of numerical data, scatterplots
    for analyzing relationships between variables, and pivot tables for summarizing
    key statistics in a single table, just to name a few using tools like Power BI,
    Tableau, etc.

    heatmaps. We will first build your understanding of what heatmaps are before highlighting
    their benefits. Then, will cover a hands-on practice to help you understand how
    they work using Power BI. Finally, we will examine some things to be aware of
    when using Power BI heatmaps.

    to graphically represent real-time financial information. They are used in data
    visualization to measure the intensity of given business values, encoded using
    different colors.

    2022\. It shows the surface air temperatures for many countries in the world.
    The hottest the area is, the darkest the color. Investly, the coldest, color is
    more driven towards blue. Such information can be easily understood at a glance.

    However, the end-users might not have the right understanding of the design concept,
    which can lead them to have a different interaction with the tool. In such a situation,
    a heatmap visualization can be used to have a better understanding of the users'
    behavior by tracking the main pages getting more interest, and the areas (clickable
    and non-clickable) that are being clicked the most.
