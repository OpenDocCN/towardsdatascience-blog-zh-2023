    Science is figuring out where exactly that journey begins and ends. In terms of
    the end to your Data Science journey, it is important to remember that strides
    are being made in the field everyday and there are bound to be new advancements
    — be prepared to learn a lot. Data Science not only consists of Science, stats,
    and programming, but also several other disciplines.

    to take information in bite-size chunks. It certainly can be fun to go down rabbit
    holes of research and learn more about specific areas of the domain — be it data,
    programming, machine-learning, analytics, or Science. While this excites me, sometimes
    it is also great to narrow that focus, and with that learn everything we possibly
    can about one specific topic. For beginners, it makes sense that these interlocked
    domains leave a questionable place to start. One thing I would attest to is that
    statistics and the normal distribution are a great place to start when it comes
    to Data Science. I wrote an article where I outlined why this is and went into
    detail on how the normal distribution. We will do a brief summary of this article
    here, but many details will be left out.

    (PDF) that we can apply over our data. This function, which we will call ***f***,
    calculates the number of standard deviatians ***x*** is in the mean for `f(x)`.
    Think. We need standard deviations from the mean, how would we check how many
    standard deviations a value is from the mean? Well first, we need to see how far
    it is from the mean, right? Then we need to see how many standard deviations that
    difference is. So that is exactly what we do in the formula. So for each x we
    subtract the mean and then divide the difference by the standard deviations. In
    statistics, lowercase sigma (σ) represents the standard deviation and lowercase
    mu (µ) represents the mean. In the formula below, x bar (x̄) represents the observation
    (the **x** in **f(x)** above.)

    — Julia. The choice of language is entirely up to the Data Scientist, but there
    are also trade-offs to consider and it is also important to consider what the
    industry is doing. For example, R is a relatively slow language but has analytics
    packages that have been refined and maintained for years by great developers and
    great dashboard tools as well. The most popular choice today is likely Python
    for its speedy connection to C libraries and ease of use. Julia is a bit of a
    new language, but it is my favorite programming language and one that I think
    most Data Scientists should be aware of. While Julia has been skyrocketing in
    popularity, there is always access to more jobs if you know both, as well. Luckily,
    most of the popular languages commonly used for Data Science tend to have a lot
    in common and end up being quite easy to reference to one another. Here is our
    normal distribution written in Python, and Julia REPLs respectively.

    languages are rather similar and pretty easy to read, so it is pretty easy to
    compare and contrast the differences, see which languages you like and also explore
    more in-depth trade-offs to each language.

    of a `Vector` of numbers. This is as simple as getting the mean and the standard
    deviation before plugging the two and our xbars into our formula. This function
    will take one argument, our `Vector`, and then it will return our normalized `Vector`.
    For this, we of course also need the mean and standard deviation — we could use
    dependencies for this. In Python, we would use Numpy’s `mean` and `std` functions.
    In Julia, we would use `Statistics.mean` and `Statistics.std`. Instead, today
    we will be doing everything from scratch, so here are my simple mean and standard
    deviation functions inside of both Python and Julia:'

    our population mean and standard deviation using our methods above and then using
    a comprehension to subtract the mean from each observation and then divide the
    difference by the standard deviations.

    just provide a vector which we know the mean of. This is because the mean of our
    Vector should be zero. So in the case of `[5, 10, 15]` , 0 would be 10 — the mean
    of `[5, 10, 15]` . 5 would be about -1.5, one standard deviations from the mean
    (our standard deviations are equal to numerical 2.5 in these circumstances).

    be noticed when they are nearly 2 standard deviations from the mean. In other

    analysis. This distribution can be used for testing, but is not as commonly used
    as something like a T-test. The reason for this is that the normal distribution
    has rather short tails. As a result, it is often reserved for tests being performed
    on large sample sizes where the variances are known. Comparing the normal distribution
    to something like the T distribution, for example, we see that the tails of the
    T distribution are a lot longer. This means that there is a longer area of statistical
    significance — thus it becomes easier to detect.

    less weighted as degrees of freedom decrease. The t-distribution above probably
    has about 8 degrees of freedom, but a T distribution with 1 degree of freedom
    would be a lot flatter with wider tails. image by author

    different enough to be statistically significant. The formula is also very similar
    to the formulas we have seen from the PDF prior, so not much is new here. Rather
    than using each observation, we simply change xbar to represent the mean of our
    the population we want to test. This test will return something called a Z-statistic.
    Similarly to a T-statistic, this is ran through another function to give us a
    probability value. Let’s create a quick one-dimensional set of observations and
    see how we would perform such a test.

    that this form of testing needs a large sample size and does not have applications
    to all data. In most cases, for beginners I would recommend starting with a distribution
    that it is easier to test with, such as the T distribution. Data is going to matter
    a lot more for Z-tests, and it can be hard to find large sources of data for beginners,
    moreover it can be more difficult to get a statistically significant result —
    even when things are statistically significant.

    for normalizing data. There are a few different things that can mess up a continuous
    feature, one of the most significant of these can be outliers. We need to get
    outliers out of our data so that way our data is a generalization. Remember, the
    key to building great data is to build a great population. What I mean by that
    is that we want the totality of the data — things like the mean — to be representative
    of what the data would normally be with some level of variance. This way whenever
    something is different it becomes very obvious.

    the mean, it might be easy to see how we could use this for data normalization.

    cases, we might also want to replace these outliers with the mean so that we do
    not lose the observation on other features or our target.

    is the Standard Scaler. The Standard Scaler is simply the normal distribution
    applied over your data. This scaler can be incredibly helpful because it helps
    translate your data into data that is more closely related to the feature it is
    a part of. This is incredibly helpful for machine-learning and makes it really
    easy to increase the accuracy of a model given that you have a continuous feature.
    Using the Standard Scaler is incredibly straightforward; simply use our PDF as
