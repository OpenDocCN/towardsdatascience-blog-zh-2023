  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on a
    wide variety of natural language tasks, their reasoning ability is constrained
    when it comes to graph-structured data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is because most graphs lack an intrinsic sequential structure that LLMs
    can process. For instance, social networks, molecular data, or knowledge graphs
    define complex relationships between entities that cannot be easily flattened
    into a text description.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As such, LLMs struggle to effectively incorporate positional and relational
    dependencies based on the graph topology into their reasoning process. Without
    straightforward conversion of nodes and edges into words/tokens, LLMs cannot perceive
    insights like neighborhood similarities, community structures, or multi-hop connections
    that facilitate graph analysis.

    neighborhood information around each node by message passing between connected
    nodes. This allows them to uncover patterns and roles of nodes based on graph
    positions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    neighbors. Capturing longer range dependencies across far-off nodes remains difficult
    for standard GNN architectures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More importantly, GNNs rely on fixed-sized vector representations of nodes that
    constrain their ability to express complex semantics. Without the ability to process
    rich textual features, the reasoning capacity gets bottlenecked on the graph side
    as well.

    of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the learning process of graph neural
    networks (GNNs), specifically on text-attributed graphs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they rely on limited textual node embeddings. Augmenting features through external
    semantic knowledge from language models provides a pathway for boosted performance.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    descriptors or labels to enrich textual attributes. These supplement the existing
    text data to allow improved embedding. For example, an LLM may output research
    area tags for papers in a citation dataset.

    instead of generic word vectors. Fine-tuning strategies like graph-based training
    or adapter layers allow injecting topology-awareness. By processing text through
    task-tuned LLMs first, the linguistic expressivity for the graph model can be

    modalities rather than using them in a decoupled manner. Specifically, the graph
    encoder leverages message passing to produce representations of structural properties
