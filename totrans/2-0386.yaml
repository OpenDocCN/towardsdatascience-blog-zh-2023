    Although it can be a bit challenging since not everyone may be interested, it
    is still possible to arrange these sessions. In these calls, team members can
    take turns every few days to teach something they are confident about to the rest
    of the team. For example, if someone is skilled in SQL, they can conduct a quick
    session for everyone on some quick tips. Likewise, if another team member possesses
    valuable domain knowledge or expertise for a particular project, they can share
    it with the wider team. This strengthens the collective knowledge base.
