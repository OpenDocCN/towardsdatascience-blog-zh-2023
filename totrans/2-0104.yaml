    to identify the causal relationship between variables based on observational data)*.
    I had taken the course in college, but I couldn’t seem to recall much from it

    tackling new exciting concepts to tickle my brain just like I like it.

    one).* I do all the right things *(or so I thought)*. I go on and on working on
    this project, and after some time… I come up with the great idea of asking other
    data scientists for clarification on a concept.
  prefs: []

    nowhere… the word of a heaven-descended causal inference expert shone down upon
    me… to nicely let me know that I was… barking up the wrong tree. My whole methodology
    was off track because I was comparing two populations of users that cannot be
    compared, which throws off the whole analysis.
