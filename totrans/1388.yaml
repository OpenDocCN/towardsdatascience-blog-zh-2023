  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most existing graph neural networks are designed for static graphs and do not
    account for temporal dynamics. For instance, models like Graph Convolutional Networks
    (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) aggregate information from neighboring
    nodes disregarding any temporal patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Without considering temporal context, predictions made using static embeddings
    quickly become outdated as the graph evolves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, static models treat all edges uniformly, lacking the nuance to
    model relationships that vary in importance or validity over time. Their representation
    also remains confined to immediate neighbors, lacking a broader temporal perspective.
