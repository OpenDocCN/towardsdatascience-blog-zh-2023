- en: Sentiment analysis is an area that has witnessed a remarkable transformation
    in the era of large language models (LLMs). As the LLMs can understand the context
    of the text, they are proving to be a very powerful way to analyze sentiments.
    The number of LLMs that are available for sentiment analysis on Hugging Face is
    impressive. The last time I checked, when writing this story, the number of models
    on Hugging Face for the sentiment task was [3017](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=sentiment)!
    This is a considerable number. Gone are the days when sentiment analysis was done
    with a handful of techniques such as traditional machine learning with TFIDF features,
    counting positive and negative words, or with libraries such as VADER.

    analysis is the main starting point that can put you in the right direction. Sentiment
    analysis for business use cases can differ based on various industries. For example,
    a use-case in banking may need sentiment analysis as positive, neutral, or negative.
    However, an e-commerce retailer would need sentiment based on a rating scale of
    1 to 5\. Understanding the requirement can help you correctly determine the scope
    of models which you need to experiment with.'

- en: '**Type of your data**: There are various types of data that require sentiment
    analysis. For example, customer reviews and tweets are obvious, however, there
    are many different types of data that require sentiment analysis such as emails,
    quality inspection notes, user-submitted content, survey response, employee feedback,
    healthcare feedback, etc. It is important to analyze what data the large-language
    model is fine-tuned on. Generally, it is better to select a model which is fine-tuned
    that has the same type as your data. Analyzing sentiment on a data type that is
    different from what was used in fine-tuning can work as an exception. For example,
    you can do sentiment analysis on customer reviews using a model which was fine-tuned
    on tweets. However, sentiment analysis on employee feedback using a model fine-tuned
    on tweets might not give good results. So try to select a model which was fine-tuned
    on data which is related to your data.'

- en: '**Base model and training parameters**: You should carefully observe the base
    model as well as the training parameters used. This can determine the restrictions
    which you might need to apply such as the maximum length of tokens or case of
    your text. For example, if the base-model maximum length is 512, and if your text
    has more tokens, the fine-tuned model would not give correct results. So try to
    understand the base model and training parameters to determine all restrictions
    which you might need to apply. Analyzing the restrictions can help you decide
    if the model is suitable for your needs or not.'

- en: '**Multi-lingualism:** As generative AI becomes of strategic importance to enterprises,
    most of the projects are global. This implies that the sentiment analysis project
    would be global in nature and should take into account different languages. This
    means that the model which you select should be multi-lingual or you should select

- en: '**Evaluation criterion**: Even though fine-tuned models are available and read-to-use,
    you should still set up some evaluation criteria. The evaluation would either
    depend on some ground-truth information you might have or could also be a human
    evaluation. The evaluation criterion needs to be objective, for example, mean
    absolute error between model output and ground truth, as I have used in this story.
