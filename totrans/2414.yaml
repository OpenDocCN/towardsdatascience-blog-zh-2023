- en: The data mesh paradigm advocates for the use of data domains as a way to partition
    data into meaningful groups. Domains are initially introduced to help create a
    clear ownership structure and enable better data discovery.

    about data mesh domains for a year, and still cannot fully grasp the concept.
    I‚Äôve thus been wondering: can we achieve better ownership and discovery without
    having to toy with data domains?'

    to tackle these three elements. So, stop reading every article you can about data
    domains, because you probably don‚Äôt need them. Or at least, not yet.

    data to facilitate ownership assignment and data discovery. Thankfully, there
    are two ways of grouping the data that your organization is already extremely
    familiar with: *teams* and *sources.*'
  prefs: []

    job in terms of ownership, discovery, and understanding. By properly using these
    classifications, companies can improve data management without needing to introduce
    the rather complex concept of domains.

    can address ownership and discovery challenges. We‚Äôll also explore when it may

    of sense for attributing ownership over the data and ensuring that responsibilities
    are clearly defined.
  prefs: []

    This means that when we say the marketing team *owns* marketing data, we mean
    that they are responsible for maintaining the documentation and context surrounding
    these assets.

    data by *teams* is the way to go:'

    in organizations. It makes it easy to assign the data to a team. Teams aren‚Äôt
    blurry, they don‚Äôt overlap, which makes assigning ownership incredibly straightforward.'
  prefs: []

    the data suddenly makes more sense. Teams have a deep understanding of the processes,
    goals and metrics they are responsible for. This makes them the absolute best
    people to bring context around data close to their function.'

    responsible for bringing context to data assets. When a stakeholder has a question

    helps people find the data they need much faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everyone in an organization is familiar with teams. Therefore, partitioning
    data based on *teams* makes data discovery a much more familiar process. This
    lowers the barrier to entry for less technical people who might be intimated by
    data.

    looking for data context: **the information seekers,** who are searching for a
    specific piece of information and **the explorers,** who want to browse the data
    landscape.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if an **information seeker** is looking for marketing data, they
    would know that the marketing team is responsible for that data and they just
    have to filter the data by Team ‚Üí Marketing in order to find it. They also know
    that if they have trouble understanding the data, they can just ask the marketing
    team.

    may want to explore the type of data that the marketing team is handling. By browsing
    through the marketing team‚Äôs dashboards and knowledge map, they will get a clearer
    picture of how the business operates.

    it might not be sufficient for discovery purposes. Therefore, another method of
    partitioning data is based on its *source*, which is another element business
    people are familiar with.

    perform their daily tasks. For instance, sales people may not be data experts,
    but they know salesforce like the back of their hands. They should thus be able
    to filter the data by *source* when exploring the warehouse.

    they will have a good idea of which data source to look for. They can filter their
    search by the *source*, such as Salesforce, and easily find the information they
    need. This enhances the discovery experience and reduces the time required for
    data exploration.

    of the data landscape, exploring the data through a source angle can be helpful.
    For example, they can determine which sources have the most relevant or trustworthy
    data for their specific needs, or identify redundant or incomplete data.

    to introduce an additional layer of complexity to accurately capture the intricacies
    of their business.

    and *sources* alone may not be sufficient to ensure discoverability and ownership.

    *teams, like* marketing, engineering, and customer support. They also grouped
    their data based on its *source*, distinguishing between website data and mobile
    app data.

    the platform, like tours or cooking classes? This information does not neatly
    fit into any of the existing teams or data sources. It‚Äôs not something that the
    marketing team owns or something that only comes from the website or app. What
    do you do then?

    create a new domain called ‚ÄúExperiences‚Äù to capture this data and ensure it‚Äôs
    properly owned. By introducing this new level of categorization, they can better
    organize their data and ensure that important information doesn‚Äôt fall through
    the cracks.

    need to introduce new levels of categorization to manage their data.
  prefs: []

    have some information that span multiple teams or sources, and that do not fall
    neatly in either category.

- en: Decentralizing data can be a difficult process, but you should always aim at
    keeping it simple. While data domains can be a powerful tool for handling complex
    business needs, you certainly do not need to introduce them early in your data
    journey.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most cases, *teams* and *sources* are sufficient for partitioning data and
    ensuring ownership and discoverability. You should thus start with these more
    familiar concepts and gradually add complexity as needed.
