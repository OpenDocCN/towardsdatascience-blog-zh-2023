    they’ve never come up with anything remotely resembling consensus. Whose job is
    it? Data engineers say data engineers, statisticians say statisticians, researchers
    say researchers, UX designers say UX designers, product managers say product managers…
    GIGO ad nauseam indeed. Data quality seems to be exactly the kind of “everybody’s

    seems to be investing in them intentionally, let alone sharing best practices.
