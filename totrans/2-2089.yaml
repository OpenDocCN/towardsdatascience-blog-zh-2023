    Software Architect, Specialist, and more.

    Whether it was my old Windows machine or taking apart pieces of my car’s engine.
    I had a fascination for how things were built. Despite these interests, my undergraduate
    years were full of transitory goals from studies in Architecture to Fine Arts.
    It was not until the late 2000’s, when I was deep into my Bachelors of Fine Arts
    program, when I had my first “Interaction Design” course that I realized, almost
    instantly, I wanted to work in the Software Industry. Something *clicked*, and
    I was ready to get out of the extremely subjective nature of the arts and design
    to something more concrete, more binary.

    books to C++ and more.

    is very important as making such a drastic career change with no understanding
    can be risky and can lead you into regretting your decision. My curiosity here
    helped me really decide if this is the path I want to take. So, after taking those
    initial steps I dove head first into making the change. Oh boy, little did I know
    the effort, stress, and confusion that would come with this decision — but, this
    is what my mind was passionate about.

    in the field of computer science (and probably most fields). The truth of the
    matter is, even if you have not received formal education you have relied on a
    wide range of resources, learning, and most importantly mentorship or guidance
    from more experience developers — in a sense, a***formal professional education***👨🏽‍🎓.

    all the buttons. That is, mindless tweaking a method or a sequence of code inputs
    to try and brute force the system into working. I fell into this trap one too
    many times. This is because it is almost like a euphoric experience once you do
    hit all the right buttons and get the darn thing to work. Nonetheless — **DO NOT
    DO THIS**. You will not get very far and even if you do get it to succeed you
    will have tried so many different options that you really don’t know why it worked
    when it did.

    try to get a deeper understanding of what you are struggling with — if you’re
    dealing with an API read the documentation again, if you’re dealing with a programming
    concept find online resources that can help you understand it in a different way.

    take the opportunity to face up to your failures and understand what happened
    and what you can do differently. This is where you grow as a programmer.

    a team. Business owners, engineers, and other stakeholders all collaborate towards
    achieving the ultimate goal of building a world class product. Each group, in
    tandem, focuses on their specialization while delivering on the overall direction
    of the solution. Of course, this is an oversimplification of how products are
    delivered. Nonetheless, it is obvious that communication, collaboration, and leaders
    are key. I have had the pleasure and privilege of working under sagacious leadership
    and also inadequate leadership (no names named here 😅). Both types of leaders
