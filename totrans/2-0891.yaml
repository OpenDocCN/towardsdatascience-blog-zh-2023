    character that always seems to know where the zombies are hidden or if it is better
    to fight with them or run away? Does this person really know what is going to
    happen? Did someone tell him/her beforehand? Maybe there is nothing magical about
    this. Maybe this person has read a lot of comics about zombies and it is really
    good at knowing what to do in each case and learning from others’ mistakes. How
    important it is to find the best way of using the events of the past as a guide
    for our decisions! This guide, also known as a decision tree, is a widely used
    supervised learning algorithm. This article is an introductory discussion about
    decision trees, how to build them and why many of them create a random forest.

    decisions we make. This model is built using previous experiences. In our example,
    we can build a decision tree using the characteristics of the 15 friends and their
    outcomes. A decision tree consists of multiple decision nodes or branches. In
    each one of these nodes, we make a decision that will take us to the following
    node until we reach an outcome.

    your grandparents or great-grandparents. From there, the tree will grow through
    your parents, uncles and cousins, until it reaches you. In a similar way, to grow
    a decision tree you always start from a node that does the best separation of
    your data. From that point, the tree will start growing according to the feature
    that best divides the data. There are [many algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Metrics)

    since *p(surv)*+*p(die)*=1\. If we plot this function you can see how the entropy
    has the highest value of one when both *p(surv)* and *p(die)* are equal to 0.5\.
    On the contrary, if the whole distribution corresponds to people who all survived
    or all died, the entropy is zero. So, the highest the entropy, the highest the
    uncertainty. The lowest the entropy, the more homogeneous the distribution is
    and the less “surprised” we will be about the outcome.

    we used before. Figure 3 shows how the entropy for the case in which people were
    trained to fight is 0.99 whereas in the other case, the entropy is zero. Remember
    that an entropy of zero means no surprise, homogeneous distribution, this is what
    is actually happening in this case since all the people who were not trained to
    fight, did not survive. At this point, it is important to note that the calculation
    of the entropy in this second scenario contains an undefined calculation since
    we will end up with a logarithm of zero. In these cases, you can always apply
    [L’Hôpital’s rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule) as
    it is explained in this [article](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/25/indeterminate-forms-and-lhospitals-rule-in-decision-trees/).

  zh: 要计算之前案例的熵，我们可以应用之前使用的相同公式。图3显示，经过战斗训练的情况下，熵为0.99，而在其他情况下，熵为零。请记住，熵为零意味着没有惊讶，分布均匀，这实际上是因为所有没有接受战斗训练的人都没有生存下来。在此阶段，重要的是要注意，在第二种情况下的熵计算包含一个未定义的计算，因为我们最终会得到一个零的对数。在这些情况下，你可以始终应用[洛必达法则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule)，正如在这篇[文章](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/25/indeterminate-forms-and-lhospitals-rule-in-decision-trees/)中所解释的那样。
- en: We now need to calculate the information gain from this decision. This is the
    same as asking how much the uncertainty in all my decisions would change if I
    decided to split all the outcomes according to this question. The information
    gain is calculated by subtracting the entropy of each decision from the entropy
    of the main node. An important thing to notice is how this operation is weighted
    according to the number of individuals on each decision. So a big entropy can
    have a small effect on the information gain calculation if the number of people
    that took that decision is small. For this example, the information gain from
    the ability to fight is 0.32 as it is shown in Figure 3.

    to the two previous features than to these ones. Remember that the biggest information
    gain corresponds to the feature in which the entropy reduction is the smallest.
    Once we have calculated all the information gains for every feature we can decide
    what the first node of the decision tree will be.

    Depending on the number of features in your data you will encounter multiple questions
    that will guide you to the final answer. It is important to notice how in this
    case one of the features is not represented in the decision tree. The ability
    to fight was never selected as a decision node since the other features always
    had a bigger information gain. This means that, according to the input data, being
    trained on how to fight is not important to survive a zombie apocalypse. However,
    this could also mean that we did not have enough samples to determine if the ability
    to fight was important or not. The key here is to remember that a decision tree
    is as good as the input data we are using to build it. In this case, a sample
    of 15 people might not be enough to have a good estimation of the importance of
    being trained to fight. This is one of the problems of the decision trees.

    On the one hand, they rely heavily on the input data. This means that a small
    change in the input data can lead to important changes in the final tree. Decision
    trees are not really good at generalizing. On the other hand, they tend to have
    overfitting problems. In other words, we can end up with a complex decision tree
    that works perfectly with the input data but it will dramatically fail when we
    use a test set. This could also affect the results if we are using the decision
    tree with continuous variables instead of categorical ones like the example presented.

    stopping the algorithm before reaching a pure node just as the ones we reached
    in our example. This could lead to the removal of a branch that is not providing
    any improvement in the accuracy of the decision tree. Pruning gives the decision
    tree more generalization power. However, if we decide to prune our decision tree
    then we might start asking additional questions such as: when is the right moment
    to stop the algorithm? Should we stop after we reach a minimum number of samples?
    Or after a predefined number of nodes? How to determine these numbers? Pruning
    can definitely help us to avoid overfitting but it may lead to additional questions

    trees and many different answers but we can always go with the majority in the
    case of a classification task or an average if we are working on regressions.
    This can help us to generalize the distribution of our data better. We might think
    that one decision tree is misclassifying but if we find 10 or 20 trees that reach
    the same conclusion, then this is telling us that there might be no misclassification
    after all. Basically, we are letting the majority decide instead of guiding ourselves

- en: Random Forests is a well-known ensemble method used for classification and regression
    problems. This method has been applied in many industries such as finance, healthcare
    and e-commerce [1]. Although the original idea of Random Forests was slowly developed
    by many researchers, Leo Breiman is commonly known as the creator of this methodology
    [2]. His [personal webpage](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm)
    contains a detailed description of Random Forests and an extensive explanation
    of how and why it works. It is a long but worthy read.

- en: An additional and important thing to understand about random forests is the
    way in which they work with the features of the dataset. At each node, the random
    forest will randomly select a pre-defined number of features instead of all of
    them to decide how to split each node. Remember that in the previous example,
    we analyzed the information gain from each feature at each level of the decision
    tree. On the contrary, a random forest will only analyze the information gain
    from a subset of the features at each node. So, the random forest mixes Bagging
    with the random variable selection at each node.

    data from 15 people and we only knew 4 things about each one of them. Let’s make
    this harder! Let’s say that now we have a dataset with more than one thousand
    entries and for each one of them we have 10 features. This dataset was randomly
    generated in Excel and does not belong to any commercial or private repository,
    you can access it from this [GitHub page](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/tree/main/RF).

    the entire dataset into a training and testing set. We will use the training set
    to build the decision tree and random forest models and then we will evaluate
    them with the test set. For this purpose, we will use the [scikit-learn libraries](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
    This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/blob/main/RF/Random_Forests_Zombie_Apocalypse.ipynb)
    contains a detailed explanation of the dataset, how to load it and how to build
    the models using the library.

    and 812 (79%) to deaths. We divided this dataset into a training set that corresponds
    to 80% of the data (819 entries) and a testing set which contains 205 entries.
    Figure 8 shows how the relation between survivals and deaths is maintained in
    all sets.

    characteristics for each individual or entry. With this information, we can build
    a decision tree following the previously explained steps. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/blob/main/RF/Random_Forests_Zombie_Apocalypse.ipynb)
    uses the function DecisionTreeClassifier to generate a Decision Tree. Note that
    this function is not meant to work for categorical variables. In this case, we
    have converted all the answers for each category to -1 or +1\. This means that
    every time we see a -1 in the results it means “No” whereas a +1 means “Yes”.
    This is better explained in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/blob/main/RF/Random_Forests_Zombie_Apocalypse.ipynb).

    使用 DecisionTreeClassifier 函数生成决策树。请注意，此函数不适用于分类变量。在这种情况下，我们已将每个类别的所有答案转换为 -1 或
    +1。这意味着每次我们在结果中看到 -1 时，表示“否”，而 +1 表示“是”。这一点在[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/blob/main/RF/Random_Forests_Zombie_Apocalypse.ipynb)中有更详细的说明。

    to the training set (click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manfrezord/MediumArticles/main/RF/Decision_Tree_Big.png)
    for a bigger picture). The dark blue boxes correspond to final decision nodes
    in which the answer was survival whereas the dark orange boxes represent final
    decision nodes where the final answer was not survival. You can see how the first
    decision node corresponds to the vehicle and from there, the tree starts growing
    according to different features.

    that the test set had 40 cases that represented survival and the decision tree
    only classified correctly 25 of them. On the other hand, from the 165 cases that
    did not survive, the decision tree misclassified 11\. The relation between the
    correct classifications and the entire dataset of 205 points is 0.87 which is
    usually known as the prediction accuracy score.

    contains an implementation of a random forest using the sklearn function RandomForestClassifier.
    This random forest will contain 10 decision trees that are built using all the

    only as good as the input data we have but also as good as the selection of parameters
    that we use. The number of decision trees we build and the number of parameters
    we analyze at each split will have an important effect on the final result. So,
    as is the case of many other supervised learning algorithms, it is necessary to
    spend some time tuning the parameters until we found the best possible result.

    to escape from the zombie that was chasing him because a tree branch fell on the
    zombie’s head just at the right time! This is not the only zombie he will encounter
    and he is definitely not out of the woods yet! There are many things about Random
    Forests and Decision Trees that were not even mentioned in this article. However,
    it is enough to understand the usage and applicability of this method. Currently,
    there are multiple libraries and programs that build these models in seconds.
    So you probably don’t need to go through the entropy and information gain calculation
    again. Still, it is important to understand what is happening behind the curtain
    and how to correctly interpret the results. In a world where topics such as “Machine
    Learning”, “Ensemble Methods” and “Data Analytics” are every day more common,
    it is important to have a clear idea of what these methods are and how to apply
    them to everyday problems. Unlike the zombie apocalypse survival movies, being
    ready does not happen by chance.
