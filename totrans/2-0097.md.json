["```py\n**Pseudo-code of the Implementation:** 1\\. Divide the time-series data into sub-sections of x (say 100) days\n2\\. Iterate through each sub-section of the data:\n    - Train data: enumerate of the data\n    - Target data: raw time-series value\n    - Train a linear regression model on train and target data\n    - compute coeffcient of the trained LR model\n3\\. Plot the coefficients\n```"]
