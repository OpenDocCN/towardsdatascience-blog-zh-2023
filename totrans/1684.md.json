["```py\n### Instruction:\nhow do I figure out how much money I need to retire?\n### Response:\nThere are a lot of assumptions embedded in any formula, so it's hard to say for\nsure what you'll need per month, but some ideas to get started would be: \naround 80k per year if you have a very high net worth or 180k per year if you \nhave a very low net worth. It sounds like your income is well above this number\n, especially if you have a lot of assets. To really know though, you'll need\n to do a full financial analysis. There are several factors that aren't \nincluded in this equation, the most important being what kind of retirement\n plan you have. If you have a 401k, the rule of thumb is ~$60k per year will\n cover a typical retirement. If you have a pension, the rule of thumb is ~$10k\n per year will cover a pension. These are rough guidelines, and there are lots \nof other factors that go into it, such as whether you have another source of\n income, what kind of investments you have, etc. A financial planner should \nbe able to help you with this. I will say that $150k per year is pretty high \neven if you have a lot of assets; the average American family makes less than\n $45k per year. If you don't have a retirement plan or your plan just isn't\n enough to support you in retirement, then yes, you should consider \nsupplementing your income. However, before you make that decision, \nyou need to be honest with yourself and ask if you live beyond the basic necessities. \nIf you have the same quality of life that you had when you were making\n half of what you are now, then yeah, you might want to look at\n```", "```py\n### Instruction:\nWhy should portfolios be diversified?\n### Response:\nBecause the performance of different assets is not identical.  Even if they are\n correctly classified as \"equities\" or \"bonds\", different stocks will behave\n differently under different economic conditions.  And even if you have the \nsame general view of the market (eg, it's overvalued), you will do better \nif you own a broad basket of stocks rather than one that is too focused on \neither the rising or falling side.  Also, different markets interact with each\n other, and crises in one affect others.  If everyone rushes into safe havens\n in a panic, for instance, then those safe havens will rise and you'll lose\n money.  Conversely, if everyone thinks a bubble is about to burst, then you\n want to be buying up the shares before everyone else catches on and they\n start declining.  A single individual or small group can be right that the \nstock market is overvalued, but if everyone thinks that way, it's time to \nsell - and the sale will be greater the earlier you join it.  Also, some \ninvestments inherently involve more risk than others.  Gambling stocks, for\n instance, would probably be a bad idea during an industrywide gambling slump. \n And some forms of investment, such as short\n```"]
