- en: A/B testing is like Jenga, a delicate balance of interconnected pieces that
    form the foundation of a successful experiment. Just like in the game of Jenga,
    where removing the wrong block can cause the entire tower to crumble, A/B testing
    relies on multiple components working together. Each piece represents a crucial
    element of the test, and if any of them fail, the integrity of the experiment
    can be compromised, leading to inaccurate results or missed opportunities.

- en: To recap, statistical power represents the probability of correctly detecting
    a true effect, or more accurately speaking, it is the *conditional* probability
    of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Statistical power is
    inversely related to the probability of committing a Type 2 error (false negative).
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, it’s common practice to set the power at 80% when conducting a study.
    Given its definition, this means that if you set the power at 80%, you would fail
    to reject the null hypothesis given that it is false 20% of the time. In simpler
    terms, if there were true effects in 100 conducted experiments, you would only
    detect 80 out of the 100.

    build, and iterate as quickly as possible. One of the reasons that large tech
    companies, like Airbnb and Uber, are able to grow so fast and maintain their market
    share is because of their ability to constantly evolve.

    that were not captured, which means 20% fewer iterations. Now compound that over,
    say 10 years, and you can understand the impact that this may have.

    to increase the sample size. By increasing the sample size, the variability in
    the data decreases which results in narrower confidence intervals and more accurate
    estimation. This is why if you use a power analysis tool like Evan Miller’s A/B
    test calculator, setting a higher power results in a bigger recommended sample
    size.'

    clear sense if you think about it. If you lowered the alpha from 0.05 to 0.01,
    the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis becomes more stringent, which
    makes it harder to reject, which results in lower statistical power. The same
    could be said for the opposite — if your alpha is too low, by increasing the alpha,
    you’re more likely to reject the null and have higher statistical power.'

- en: The minimum detectable effect (MDE) represents the smallest effect size that
    an experiment can detect reliably. If the observed effect size falls below the
    MDE, it suggests that the effect is so small that it could be due to random variation
    or noise in the data rather than a genuine, meaningful effect.

- en: If that’s the case then why *wouldn’t* you want to set the MDE as low as possible?
    This is where the idea of **statistical significance vs practical significance**
    comes into play — while **statistical significance** focuses on the probability
    that an effect is not due to random chance, **practical significance** takes into
    account the magnitude and implications of the effect in practical terms.

- en: To give an example, I conducted a pricing experiment at KOHO to determine price
    elasticity for a given product. The end result was *statistically significant*
    in that the reduction in price resulted in an increase in product adoption. However,
    reducing the price as much as we did was not *practically significant* because
    despite the increased number of users that subscribed, the price reduction ultimately
    led to a lower profit overall.

  zh: 举个例子，我在KOHO进行了一项定价实验，以确定某一产品的价格弹性。最终结果在*统计上显著*，因为价格的降低导致了产品采纳的增加。然而，我们降低价格的幅度并不*实际显著*，因为尽管用户数量增加了，但价格的降低最终导致了总体利润的减少。

  zh: 解决方案是什么？
- en: You should choose an MDE based on practical effect sizes that are relevant to
    the context and align with the objectives of the experiment. This ensures that
    the detected effects are both statistically significant and practically meaningful,
    while also optimizing resource allocation and avoiding the risk of false negatives.

  id: totrans-35
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '**为什么这是个问题？**'
- en: The problem with this is that as you conduct more hypothesis tests, you’re more
    likely to obtain statistically significant results by chance. Statistically speaking,
    this is because of the alpha that is set when A/B testing. The alpha represents
    the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, so if we set
    it to 0.05 then 5 out of 100 true tested hypotheses will be rejected.
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 问题在于，当你进行更多的假设检验时，你更有可能偶然获得统计显著的结果。从统计学角度看，这是因为A/B测试时设定的alpha值。alpha代表了在原假设为真的情况下拒绝原假设的概率，因此如果我们将alpha设为0.05，那么100个真实测试的假设中有5个将被拒绝。
- en: What’s the solution?
  id: totrans-37
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 解决方案是什么？
- en: The solution to this is to control for false discoveries (false positives),
    and there are several methods to achieve this. The most common technique is the
    **Bonferroni Correction**, which simply adjusts the significance level (alpha)
    by dividing it by the number of tests being performed. For example, if you are
    conducting 10 hypothesis tests and want to maintain an overall alpha of 0.05,
    you would divide 0.05 by 10, resulting in an adjusted alpha of 0.005 for each
    test. This correction ensures a more stringent criterion for declaring statistical
    significance, reducing the chances of false positives.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 解决方案是控制虚假发现（假阳性），有几种方法可以实现这一点。最常见的技术是**Bonferroni校正**，它通过将显著性水平（alpha）除以测试的数量来进行调整。例如，如果你进行10次假设检验并希望保持整体alpha为0.05，你需要将0.05除以10，从而为每个测试得到调整后的alpha值0.005。此校正确保了更严格的统计显著性标准，减少了假阳性的可能性。
