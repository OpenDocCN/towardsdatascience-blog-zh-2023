    if the Roman Empire hadn’t fallen? How advanced would our technology be today?”
    She didn’t particularly appreciate my question. In fact, historians often express
    reservations about “what if” questions, sometimes referred to as counterfactual
    history. They prefer to interpret and explain events as they occurred, not as
    they might have happened. Their work is grounded in facts, sources, and evidence,
    and “what if” scenarios can potentially lead to conjecture or speculation, detracting
    from the rigorous analysis of historical realities.

    have happened had we not experienced the Medieval Age. Would positivist science
    have developed earlier? Would wars have occurred as often throughout the centuries?
    Would we have taken better care of our planet?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such questions remain open because once a development occurs, it’s impossible
    to experience an alternate reality in which that development didn’t occur. This
    is essentially the fundamental problem of causal inference, the science behind
    the study of cause and effect. For instance, if the government decides to implement
    a policy prohibiting the consumption of alcohol, will it result in a decrease
    in deaths from car accidents? Ideally, this causality question would be answered
    by comparing the car accident death rates in our actual world, without the prohibition,
    and in a parallel world where the only difference is the implementation of the
    policy. In this ideal scenario, the effect of the policy would be the difference
    between the death rates observed without the policy and the death rates under
    the policy. Obviously, this isn’t feasible, as we only have access to our own
    reality.

- en: I have always been interested in the dynamics of education and public policy,
    particularly how they can interplay to shape a society’s future. When it came
    time to choose a topic for my master’s thesis, I was keen on exploring something
    relevant, impactful, and grounded in real-world implications. I wanted to delve
    into a topic that could potentially provide insights into improving the education
    system in Brazil not just in theory but in practice as well. It was during this
    quest that I came across two intriguing educational policies implemented in the
    Brazilian state of Ceará.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first policy was a tax incentive (TI) for mayors to improve municipal education.
    It was an innovative approach that tied municipal tax transfers to educational
    achievement, encouraging local governments to invest more in their education systems.
    The second policy was a program offering educational technical assistance (TA)
    to municipalities, providing them with the necessary resources to improve their
    educational practices.

    states even if they invested less resources as the plot below shows. The y-axis
    shows the positive score change of students in mathematics and Portuguese tests,
    while the x-axis shows the average spending in education.

    policies deeper and once again, I came across the fundamental problem of causal
    inference: What if Ceará hadn’t adopted these policies? Would their educational
    indicators be worse? In other words, did these policies have a positive effect
    on educational achievement? I didn’t have a perfect counterfactual, an alternate
    Ceará where the policies had not been adopted. Fortunately, causal inference provides
    some methods to approximate counterfactuals. One of them is the synthetic control
    method.'

- en: The synthetic control method is a statistical technique used primarily in evaluating
    the effects of policy changes or other interventions when a control group isn’t
    available. The principle is based on the creation of a synthetic version of the
    unit of interest (in this case, Ceará) by combining multiple states that didn’t
    undergo the policy change. This “synthetic control” serves as the counterfactual
    — it’s what we might expect to have happened in the unit of interest had the policy
    not been implemented.

- en: 'To construct this synthetic control, we must select a set of states not impacted
    by the policy — these are often referred to as donor units. The synthetic control
    is then created as a weighted combination of these donor units, chosen in such
    a way that the synthetic control closely matches the pre-intervention characteristics
    of the treated unit (Ceará). Essentially, the synthetic control represents a hypothetical
    Ceará that did not adopt the educational policies. This explanation simply outlines
    the fundamental idea behind the method. For a more comprehensive understanding,
    please refer to “Using Synthetic Controls: Feasibility, Data Requirements, and
    Methodological Aspects” by Alberto Abadie (2021)².'

- en: Once the synthetic control is established, we compare the post-intervention
    outcomes of the treated unit (Ceará) and its synthetic counterpart. The difference
    between the outcomes of these two can be interpreted as the effect of the intervention
    or policy.

    in both Ceará and the artificially constructed Ceará, unaffected by the policy.
    Note that the synthetic and actual trends closely align before the policy implementation
    but diverge significantly thereafter. According to this method, in the absence
    of the policy, Ceará’s scores would have followed the trajectory represented by
    the yellow line. The actual scores of Ceará, under the influence of the policies,
    are represented by the green line. The distinction between these two lines indicates
    a positive effect of these policies.

    test scores in primary education and a 6.5 percent increase in lower secondary
    education. The results suggested that well-designed policies could make a substantial
    difference in educational outcomes. The findings in mathematics were not statistically
    significant. In my published thesis¹ I provide some explanations for why this
    happened.

- en: However, my analysis also revealed an area of concern. Despite these advancements
    in primary and lower secondary education, upper secondary schools, which were
    not directly affected by the new policies but received better-prepared students
    from lower levels, showed no significant improvement. This finding highlighted
    a critical gap in policy implementation and sparked a need for further debate
    on extending the benefits of educational policies to upper secondary schools,
    as well as to other Brazilian states.

    of these policies on Ceará’s educational achievement, offering a quantitative
    dimension to the question of “what if”. With this approach, my research went beyond
    the realm of theoretical speculations, enabling a rigorous analysis based on data

    opportunity, and democracy in developing countries. My journey using synthetic
    control has revealed the potential of well-designed policies to substantially
    improve educational outcomes. It is my hope that these findings offer policy-makers
    valuable insights to make informed choices for our educational future.
