- en: Demand forecasting is a process that estimates an organization’s sales over
    a certain horizon in the future. Short-term demand forecasts typically look out
    over 1–3 months, while mid-term forecasts can range over 6–18 months. Long-term
    forecasts often go up to 3–5 years. Forecasting helps the business decide on what,
    when and how much to sell, inventory to hold, and where to invest in capacity
    for the future to meet a dynamic customer demand. Companies usually rely on historical
    trends overlaid with inputs from customers, while also factoring in promotions
    or fire sales, to create a demand forecast.

    Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) process where the forecasts generated in this
    stage trickle down to other stages including supply planning, production scheduling,
    logistics planning, and inventory optimization. It is critical for the demand
    forecast to be as accurate as possible to avoid costs associated with too much
    or too little inventory. Over-forecasting can lead to excess working capital being
    tied up in inventory. On the other hand, consistent under-forecasting can stock
    out customers or lead to a scramble to make orders using more expensive raw materials
    and ship on short notice with more expensive transportation. An accurate plan
    helps avoid these situations by driving the manufacture of the right quantity
    of product at the right location at the right time, and facilitates high service
    levels and lower costs of storage.

- en: Demand sensing is expected to have a high economic value (in terms of cost savings
    or avoiding revenue loss) simply due to the sheer magnitude of shipments. Due
    to the granularity of the predictions, and the frequency of refreshes, demand
    sensing can be data and computationally intensive. But with more computational
    power available to consumers, tractability is expected to be high. Demand sensing
    results are mostly high in explainability since we typically use linear regression-based
    models for these applications. More often than not, the results can be analyzed
    to explain the predictions clearly to stakeholders. The forecast update recommendations
    from demand sensing are actionable since it is an organization’s internal decision
    to change production based on forecast changes. Demand sensing applications are
    also mostly sustainable in terms of input data refreshes since they rely on real-time
    order data generated on a daily basis.

- en: Demand sensing relies on relevant leading indicators to estimate a sales forecast.
    The rate at which customer orders are placed could be one such leading indicator
    of near-term demand. In some industries, such as the petrochemical industry, customers
    typically place orders to be booked in each month several weeks ahead of time.
    In this article, we talk about a demand sensing approach based on customer orders
    for a chemical company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this approach, the premise is that if orders are placed at a faster rate
    early on compared to historical order placement trends, the final monthly demand
    is going to be high and vice-versa. The proposal is to augment the traditional
    forecasting process by performing the customer ordering trend analysis in the
    middle of every month to estimate product demand for the next month. This early
    insight would be very helpful to supply chain and product managers to make decisions
    on adjusting production and pricing. The analysis would also identify customers
    that were likely to place orders below their forecast making the remaining volume
    available for customers that wanted additional product over their forecasted volumes.
    This would enable proactively ‘swapping’ product between the two sets of customers
    reducing order blocks and delays and enrich the customer experience.

    gather sales orders that include data on requested volumes, sales order date,
    demand booking month, customer information including customer category and geography,
    product attributes including product family, market segment. We start with a demand
    booking month and look for total product volume requested in the sales orders
    on a daily basis (workdays excluding weekends and holidays) over a two-month period
    starting from the first workday of the prior month (CM-1) to the end of the demand
    booking month (CM). This is assuming no orders are placed before that date (1st
    workday of prior month). We also need to remove cancelled orders or returned orders
    from the analysis. Table 1 shows the sample data in a dataframe.'

    demand, we select market segment, geography, cumulative order volumes, and monthly
    baseline sales forecast as the predictor features. Cumulative orders by a given
    workday (Table 2) are derived from daily order volumes as part of feature engineering.

    for this use case. This is expected to be ‘piecewise’ solution, where we have
    different regression functions for each workday. With 36 months of data, hundreds
    of customers for each product family, we would have thousands of data points in
    the training set for each product family. We start with defining a loss function
    to help us build the model that provides the most accurate demand forecasts. We
    choose several accuracy measures including mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute
    percent error (MAPE), and R2 and test performance of different models across these
    metrics (we want the R2 to be high and the errors to be low). The raw error is
    simply the difference between monthly demand prediction and historical actuals
    at the product family level. In terms of data preparation, we first split the
    data into training set (80% of the data) and test set (20% of the data). The missing
    or null values are treated separately for each set to avoid data leakage. If the
    missing values make up a majority of a feature, we may drop the feature entirely
    as it yields little predictive power. If null values are present in only a few
    rows, we may drop rows with missing values. We may also impute missing values
    with the central tendencies such as the median of the column if it is numerical,
    or the mode if it is categorical. Further, we also convert categorical variables
    into numerical format with *one-hot encoding*. To scale the data for input into
    a linear regression model, we divide the dependent variable (monthly demand prediction)
    by the baseline sales forecast and cumulative orders (independent variable) by
    the baseline sales forecast. The regression model coefficients provide the significance
    of the features in explaining the variation in the predicted variable.'

    as solid lines, while the real-time cumulative orders (as a percentage of the
    baseline sales forecast for next month) are plotted as the dotted line. We can
    see that in the historical months selected, around 12% of total demand is ordered
    by the 10th workday of the prior month but we are trending at ~5% of the forecast
    indicating the demand is coming in softer than expected for the baseline forecast.
    For this example, with stakeholder buy in to update the demand forecasts, we can
    inform decisions on decreasing production for the product family in question while
    identifying customers that are ordering lower than what they provided as forecast.
    In general, the predictions can be run daily to provide signals to manufacturing
    on production and inventory and to sales teams on demand weakness or strength.
    The AI/ ML models can themselves be re-trained once every quarter or at the time
    of business re-structuring.

    from stock outs and increased storage costs associated with excess unsold inventory.
    While fluctuations in forecast can balance out over longer periods of time, a
    consistent bias in forecasting can lead to an unbalanced portfolio of products.
    The lost revenues from short-term stock outs can have an impact on the business
    in the long-term if customers choose to leave the organization permanently in
    favor of competitors. We illustrate lost revenue through a simplistic example
    in Table 3 below where a key assumption is that the organization does not have
    sufficient inventory to cover for forecast inaccuracies. This table provides the
    baseline forecast (without the AI application) and actual demand from customers
    on a monthly basis for 10 product families: PF1 to PF10\. The price per product
    family is also provided. The magnitude of these numbers is representative of a
    commodity chemical product.'

    the under-forecasted products, we assume lack of inventory to cover this shortfall
    and calculate the lost revenue by multiplying the price with the shortfall. The
    total lost revenue is estimated to be ~$58MM. With an AI enabled application to
    sense the future monthly demand using daily real-time orders and update the forecast
    and make the right volumes of products, we can reduce this lost revenue. Even
    with 20% improvement in the forecast error (not atypical of such applications),

    conventional forecasting methods as it makes use of real-time information to upgrade
    the accuracy of the forecasts. We’ll note though that it may not be applicable
    to all use cases or business situations. It works well when there’s some regularity
    in ordering pattern and orders are placed in advance. This technique works best
    when combined with market intelligence to understand the business insight behind
    observations. The approach doesn’t translate to forecasting beyond 6–8 weeks as
    customers usually do not place orders that far in advance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The method described in this post can also be used for other purposes. For example,
    we can use this approach to estimate the deviation between expected demand and
    actual orders placed for each customer/product combination. This can help identify
    customers for further investigation who have ordered too little or too much product
    volume as a percent of their baseline sales forecast compared to their historical
    ordering pattern.
