    Then, this tutorial is for you. There are a lot of concepts that are taken for
    granted when you begin this journey and will allow you to manipulate geographic
    information in your dataset.

- en: Geospatial data analysis is a subfield of data science that focus on a special
    type of data, geospatial data. Differently from normal data, each record of the
    geospatial data corresponds to a specific location and can be drawn on a map.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A specific data point can be described just by latitude and longitude. But you
    have a dataset with more complex items, like roads, rivers, boundaries between
    countries or the physical map with mountains, deserts and forests, a pair of coordinates
    is not enough anymore. Did I intrigue you? Let’s get started!

    When dealing with vector data, you still have a tabular dataset, while raster
    data are more similar to coloured images with three channels, red, green and blue.
    Just focusing on vector data, we can distinguish three different cases: point
    data, line data and polygon data.'

    point and an ending point. Classic examples can be streets, train routes and rivers,
    which you can visualize below.

    points that are connected and closed. The simplest example to keep in mind for
    this particular type of data is by thinking boundaries of countries. Below, I
    provide you with an overview of our glaciers and recently deglaciated areas.

    the most fascinating for me. As I said previously, it may be confused with images
    since they both are matrices of pixels. But differently from common images, each
    pixel corresponds to a different geographic region and each value of this pixel
    describes a particular characteristic of the territory.

    information than the vector data in terms of real-world surface. Examples of raster
    data are satellite images and aerial photographs.

    of people. So, it doesn’t just provide actionable insights for businesses, but
    it can save even lives. This is possible by training deep learning models to depict
    specific objects in Satellite images.

    the vector data, you’ll have a zip file, composed of three mandatory files:'

    and the **coordinate reference system**, which is another characteristic of geospatial
    data. This last aspect is crucial for converting the locations on the earth, with
    an irregular spheroid-like shape, into a 2D map. You can notice that it doesn’t
    match the CRS of QGIS and needs to be changed.
