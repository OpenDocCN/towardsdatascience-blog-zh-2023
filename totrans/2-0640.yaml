- en: In a nutshell, there are four data platform architecture types that would define
    the selection of tools you might want to use while building a pipeline. This is
    the key to this question — it helps to choose the right DE tools and techniques.
    Data lakes, warehouses, and lake houses each have their benefits and serve each
    purpose. The fourth architecture type is **Data Mesh** where data management is
    decentralised. **Data Mesh** defines the state when we have different data domains
    (company departments) with their own teams and shared data resources. It might
    seem a bit more chaotic but many companies choose this model to reduce data bureaucracy.

    It makes the data stack look modern and flexible due to built-in ANSI-SQL capabilities.
    The shift to a lake or data warehouse would depend primarily on the skillset of
    your users. The Data warehouse solution will enable more interactivity and narrow
    down our choice to a SQL-first product (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.).

    using relationships between entities (tables, views, silos, data lakes). You would
    want to demonstrate that you understand how this process works in terms of **the
    conceptual** and **physical** design process. We always start with the concept
    of creating a model for our business process or a data transformation task. Then
    it is followed by a functional model which is a prototype and it aims to prove
    that our conceptual model works for this task. In the end, we will create a physical
    model which contains the final infrastructure including all required physical
    entities and objects. It’s good to say that it doesn’t have to be SQL entities
    always. Conceptual data modelling might include all types of data platforms with
    semi-structured data files in the cloud storage. A good example would be a scenario
    when we need to prepare data in the data lake first and then use it to train the
    machine learning (ML) model. I previously wrote about it in this story:'

    Try to be concise and say that Star schema is where we can take advantage of super
    large denormalised datasets connected to one fact table. That’s why it’s a Star
    database design pattern as it looks like a star. This is more suitable for data
    warehouse OLAP-style analytics pipelines. Data in those datasets is not always
    up-to-date but that’s fine because we need it to be materialised this way and
    we can update the required fields if needed.
  id: totrans-52

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Opposite to a Star schema Snowflake schema design has the same fact table in
    the center but it is linked with many other fact and dimension tables which are
    typically **denormalised.** This schema design is more suitable for OLTP data
    processing when data needs to be always up-to-date and individual rows can be
    pulled fast to use in the application.

    are data processing systems designed for completely different purposes. OLAP aims
    to aggregate and store the data for analytical purposes such as reporting and
    large-scale data processing, That’s why denormalised super big tables are seen
    very often here. OLTP processing is different in the way we process data — it
    would have a single transaction focus and require lightning-fast data processing.
    Good examples are in-app purchases, managing user accounts and updating store
    content. Data for OLTP is stored in indexed tables connected using the Snowflake
    pattern where dimension tables are mostly normalised.
