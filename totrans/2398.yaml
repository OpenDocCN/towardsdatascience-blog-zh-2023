    range of data roles, you may have heard about all these roles. A few years ago
    a new role appeared together with the rise of transformation tools like dbt: the
    [Analytics Engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people) role. In
    January 2021 [Atlan](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2021/01/the-top-5-data-trends-for-cdos-to-watch-out-for-in-2021/)
    also predicted the emergence of Data Platform Leaders. Whether these predictions
    are craze or trend, my feeling is that **the range of data roles is set to continue
    expanding.**'

    that a new role is on the rise in the data industry: the Data Strategist. I have
    been in this position since October 2022\. My guess is that this kind of position
    is to become more and more important within organizations. The reason for that
    is simple: **Data Strategists are at the crossroads of data individual contributors,
    strategic consultants and team managers.**'

    since the beginning of 2023, layoffs are on the rise in the tech industry. With
    budgets allocated to data teams being reduced, data teams tend to be of a smaller
    size. Yet they are still expected to deliver a similar amount of work. Leaders
    have to do investment tradeoffs between data analytical vs. data engineering vs.
    data science vs. team management roles. Thus having one person who can **master
    several aspects of data roles** will be of a strategic advantage in this new context.

    Strategist fulfills three types of roles: Data Consultant, Head of Data, and Data
    Team Lead.** Depending on the context one role may take more time than another.
    Similarly the organization’s structure and the Data Strategist’s prior background
    will influence their actual job description.'

    yourself a data strategist. Whether it is in an analytical or an engineering role,
    having prior knowledge about data infrastructure, pipelines, ad-hoc analyses using
    SQL or Python, and data visualization techniques are the foundations to be credibly
    working in a data role.

    heart of the position — we are talking about a data *strategist* after all. This
    means having a long-term vision for the organization regarding all things related
    to data. Then one must be able to derive concrete actions and build a consistent
    roadmap from long-term goals. In my opinion switching between short-term execution
    and long-term vision is what makes the role of a Data Strategist so exciting.

    a data strategist is part of the organization. Thus they have a role to play in
    leading the data team members towards the defined strategy. In practice the exact
    position within an org chart will vary based on the organization’s management
    structure.

    advanced SQL functions to being able to present key financial figures to an executive
    board.

    daily work as a Data Strategist in [this article](https://datatalks.club/podcast/s14e03-data-strategy-key-principles-and-best-practices.html).
    I could find many similarities between our two positions despite having a different

    particular soft skills are key to successfully communicate your vision and the
    derived roadmap to various stakeholders. Good communication skills and an ability
    to summarize help others to adhere to the strategy put in place. As for hard skills,
    having some prior work experience as an individual contributor in a data team
    make the actions conducted more relevant considering the reality of data jobs.

    little-used term**. When I got that title last year, I had a hard time finding
    job offers with this job title. Similar positions to what my employer and I would
    call “a Data Strategist” could be “Data Team Lead” or to a certain extent “Head
    of Data” at other organizations. But as mentioned previously my day-to-day work
    would include a broader range of missions, including some that require more a
    consulting approach than a corporate executive one. To me we had simply invented
    a new job title describing what I would do for the company: **working with data
    with a strategic approach.**'
  prefs: []

    has been around for quite a while. As an example an article called [“The Rise
    of the Data Strategist”](/the-rise-of-the-data-strategist-2402abd62866) already
    mentioned the emergence of this position in 2019\. When looking at Google Trends
    there is indeed no clear upward trend in the number of searches for the term “data
    strategy” or “data strategist”.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it’s not a new job title I invented, **my take is that job offers for
    Data Strategists will increase in the upcoming years**. As I previously mentioned,
    the search for a person who can simultaneously master data hard skills and strategic
    soft skills will become more common as budgets allocated to data teams are increasingly
    watched closely.

    for anyone willing to **develop their career in tech and/or at data-related jobs**.
    From the position of a Data Strategist one can evolve towards roles like head
    of data at a company or data consultant at a consulting firm, or become part of
    the strategic team at an organization for example.
