    However, I had a recent privilege to team up with a family to up-skill their digital
    literacy & one of the topics we decided on is Excel.

- en: I worked as a full-time data analyst for several years. This title has somewhat
    been diluted in recent years as many varying roles are required to process, obtain
    insights and present data. Even as a DevSecOps engineer today, I still have to
    do that to ensure all the systems I manage are working effectively & efficiently.

    analytics software in the “non-tech” world. The data analytics & visualisation
    skills learnt here can easily translated to any domain, and any software as long
    as we develop strong fundamentals.
