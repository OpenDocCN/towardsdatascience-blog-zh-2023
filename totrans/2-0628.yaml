    datasets to building complex models, there’s always a lot to do, and not enough
    time to do it. But what if there was a way to streamline and automate some of
    the more routine tasks, freeing up more time for strategic thinking and decision-making?
    That’s where LLMs come in.

    range of natural language processing tasks, from generating text to answering
    questions. And as it turns out, they can also be a valuable tool for data analysts.

    work as a data analyst, and show you how AI can help you work smarter, not harder.

    the musical key for the song, and the “Album” column describes whether it is an
    album or single. A typical analyst wouldn’t be able to guess these just looking

    worth experimenting with different input formats to see which works best for a
    given task. Finally, it’s important to remember that LLMs are a tool, not a replacement
