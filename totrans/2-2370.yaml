    chances are that your [hypothesis testing procedure](http://bit.ly/quaesita_donttrust)
    lacks a crucial step that’s tragically — or tragicomically? — omitted from your
    typical coursework. Never fear, in this blog post I’ll show you the missing piece
    and why you’ll find the fix in the thespian’s playbook.

    actual data](http://bit.ly/quaesita_srstrees2). Perhaps it’ll all be digital;
    you’re off to tell your engineering team which [variables](http://bit.ly/quaesita_gistlist)
    to start logging or which online [experiments](http://bit.ly/quaesita_ab) to run.
    Or maybe you’re stepping out into the physical world to set some sensors, prep
    some pipettes, or whatever else it takes to get your hands on data. (Curious about
    the practical side of taking measurements from the real world? Check out my article
    about [sampling trees](http://bit.ly/quaesita_srstrees1).)

    not to mention a tremendous squandering of your team’s precious time, to mess
    up the real world part of your data collection process. Even if it’s all digital,
    you’d really rather not have to slink back to your engineering team with your
    tail between your legs and ask for a redo.
  prefs: []

    Is there a trick for this? Thankfully, yes! And the trick is so obvious in hindsight…
    which is perhaps why your professors forgot to teach it to you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [data science](http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci), a dress rehearsal involves
    making a fake-but-plausible dataset. We call this ***simulation***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of simulating fake-but-plausible data,
    head over to [this blog post](http://bit.ly/quaesita_sims) where I switch modes
    to show rather than tell. You’ll see a code-based and spreadsheet-based example
    there. Read on here once you’ve formed mental image of how simulation looks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you simulate your dress rehearsal data, be sure to cook up a clear story
    that you have control over. Try setting the simulation parameters to build a little
    toy world in which you’d want to take one action, then generate that data and
    try analyzing it. Make sure you can recover the right decision at the end of your
    analysis. If you can’t, that’s a really bad sign for your statistical plan!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you know what the right conclusion is (which you always do in a world whose
    rules *you* created) and your approach doesn’t give it to you, you might be using
    a bad method or you might not have enough data. It’s always better to get those
    warning signals early.
  prefs: []

    data differently [in the first place](http://bit.ly/quaesita_gigo). As you analyze
    your fake data, you find yourself thinking, *“If only I had this additional column,
    everything would be better…”*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, ***now’s*** the time to figure that out and nip [GIGO](http://bit.ly/quaesita_gigo)
    in the bud, not *after* you’ve gone and collected the real data. Too expensive
    and too time-consuming!

    fit for it. Unfortunately, unless you’re doing something fairly sophisticated,
    you should know that you can only use a real testing dataset one time. So that’s
    one shot only — you don’t get to try out different methods the way you’d do if
    you were [training a machine learning model](http://bit.ly/mfml_054). Statistical
    inference is a brutal epistemological endeavor that cares not a jot for your feelings:
    it’s one shot only. No data reuse allowed.'

    you can commit against statistical decency, and the fact that your undereducated
    peers make this mistake frequently [doesn’t mean it’s harmless](http://bit.ly/mfml_076).

    test data, you need a separate dataset with the same structure. If you’ve already
    got plenty of data, you’ll [split it](http://bit.ly/quaesita_sydd). If you don’t
    have any data yet, you’ll simulate some fake data for the purposes of planning
    your methodological approach. Never muck about with method selection in your precious
    final dataset. You only get one shot, don’t throw it away.

    a useful trick, totally plagiarized from the dress rehearsal concept.
