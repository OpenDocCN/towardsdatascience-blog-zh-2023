    half is (slightly) *faster* than the first — a *negative split —* because *“*[*this
    is how elites win*](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20819476/what-world-records-teach-about-marathon-pacing/)*”*
    and how records tend to be broken. However, this analysis of more than [4 million
    marathons](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251513) shows that almost
    90% of races are completed with a *slower* second half (a *positive split*).

    is an effective pacing strategy for recreational runners.

    by running a faster first half (i.e. a positive split) is not a good idea. The

    all, elite marathoners have a lot more experience when it comes to managing their
    pace, effort, and energy for the duration of the marathon distance. In contrast,
    most recreational runners have probably completed the total marathon distance
    only a handful of times.

    questioning the wisdom of negative splits and speculating about the potential
    benefits of an intentional positive split, the so-called *controlled fade,* in
    which runners complete the second half of the race between 30 seconds and 3 minutes
    *slower* than their first half. For example, in a controlled fade, a 4-hour (240
    minutes) marathoner might complete her first half in 119 minutes and her second
    half in 121 minutes for *relative half split (RHS)* of about +0.01 — a 1% positive
    split — based on the formulation below. Conversely, a different runner might achieve
    the same result with a 121-minute first half and a 119-minute second half, for
    a -0.01 *negative* split.

    of public race records, collected from the published results data of many big
    city marathons around the world during the period from 2005 to 2019\. This dataset
    contains just over 4 million unique race records (including 5 km/~3 mile split
    times and overall finish times) for approximately 2.7 million unique runners.
    These race records come from 270 different marathons across 38 cities. Full details

    that they run their races this way. Nevertheless, in our dataset, we find that
    89% of all races are indeed completed using a positive split — a very close match
    to the Runner’s World poll — with no significant difference between males and
    females. Notably, while the mean RHS of negative splits is very similar between
    males and females (-0.045 vs. -0.044, respectively), the mean RHS for males with
    a positive split (0.16) is larger than it is for females (0.13) and there is a
    lot more RHS variability among males.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of races with various RHS values. The most common
    RHS is approximately 0.05 (a race whose second half is 5% longer than the first
    half). The fraction of male and female runners is almost identical for various
    degrees of negative splits (RHS<0) but there are some differences in the fraction
    of males and females running positive splits. Female runners are more likely than
    males to run a *moderate* positive split (0<RHS<0.2), whereas males are more likely
    to run a more *extreme* positive split (RHS > 0.2); this is consistent with [previous
    research](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251513) showing that males
    are much more likely to hit the wall (a very large positive split) than females.
    We see a similar pattern in (b) when we compare runners based on the split difference
    in minutes between each half of the race (i.e., second-half time — first-half
    time) although the gap between male and female runners is less pronounced by this
    measure.

    (d) we plot the mean finish times of male and female runners based on the degree
    of relative split (RHS) and split difference in minutes, respectively. There is
    a finish-time cost when splits become less even (in a negative and positive direction)
    and the fastest finish times are associated with slightly positive splits for
    male and female runners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note too that the finish times in Figures 1(c) and (d) are not symmetrical.
    The times of negative splits appear to increase more rapidly than the corresponding
    times of positive splits. We can see this more clearly in Figures 2(a) and (b).
    We plot the mean finish times for male and female runners against their *absolute*
    RHS, effectively mirroring the negative split times so that we can compare them
    more directly to the positive split times. In each case, for a given absolute
    RHS, the positive split finish time is faster than the corresponding negative
    split finish time; e.g. a 5% positive split is faster than a 5% negative split.
    And, for increasing absolute RHS values, this difference between the positive
    and negative finish times (the shaded region) is itself increasing, more so for
    males than for females.

    faster runners tend to run more evenly-paced races. Therefore, faster runners
    make up the bulk of the cohorts of runners in the more even RHS groups, hence
    the faster finish times. One way to account for this is to look for a way to examine
    performances that is *independent* of runner ability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this we focus on runners who have run at least 5 marathons in our dataset
    — there are 101,120 and they have run 680,921 races — and for each runner, we
    identify their fastest finish time as their *personal best (PB)* time. Of course,
    this cannot be guaranteed to be their true PB, since at least some of these runners
    will have completed marathons outside of our dataset. Nevertheless, it will serve
    as a useful (conservative) estimate of their true PB time, and we can use it to
    evaluate the performance of a runner relative to their PB; we define the *relative
    finish time* of a non-PB race to be its finish time divided by the runner’s PB
    time so that a relative finish time of 1.1 means that a race is 10% *slower* than
    the runner’s PB.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More than 80% of runners complete their PBs with a *more even split* (RHS ~
    0.069) than the average split of their non-PB races (RHS ~ 0.13), which further
    supports the hypothesis that more even pacing is a good strategy. In Figure 3(a)
    below we see that these *relative finish times* also improve as splits become
    more even and, in Figure 3(b), the fraction of races that are PBs is also much
    higher for these more evenly-paced races.

    find the best (PB) races of runners to be more evenly paced than non-PB races,
    regardless of ability. Moreover, the relative performance of non-PB races improves
    for more evenly paced non-PB races and, again, regardless of ability, the most
    PBs and the best relative finish times are associated with slightly positive splits.

    finish times of races with positive splits. Figures 4(a) and (b) show this, again
    by plotting the relative finish times of runners according to absolute RHS values,
    for males and females. In both cases, the relative finish times of positive splits
    are better (lower) than the relative finish times of negative splits.

    splits, not negative splits, that appear to benefit recreational runners. Why
    should this be the case? Our working hypothesis is that it comes down to whether
    a runner manages to pace their race in such a way that they have put the maximum
    effort into it, finishing just as their reserves finally deplete.

    run an evenly paced race without pushing themselves too much — forgoing a PB —
    to finish well within their current ability. Or a runner might run a negative
    split that is too conservative, so that even with a faster second half they cross
    the line with yet more to give; another missed opportunity to PB. Or, as is often
    the case, a planned positive split, with a first half that is too fast, will see
    a marathoner running on empty long before the finish line, and slowing too much
    to PB.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We argue that the reason why *moderate* positive splits (0 < RHS < 0.25) appear
    to be better than their corresponding *moderate* negative splits (-0.25 < RHS
    < 0), at least among recreational runners, is that moderate positive splits are
    easier to “*get right’*’ than moderate negative splits. Or, to put it another
    way, runners who run a moderate negative split appear to be at a greater risk
    of crossing the line with more left in the tank, and underperforming as a result,
    than those running a corresponding positive split are at a risk of running on
    empty before they finish.

- en: We can gain some insight into this by looking at how a runner completes the
    final stage of the marathon (the last 2.2 km or ~1.37 miles in our dataset) because
    whether, and by how much, they slow down or speed up, during this section of the
    race, will tell us a lot about their current condition. In Figure 5(a) we plot
    the *relative pace* for the final 2.2 km (actual final pace divided by mean race
    pace) for different ranges of RHS. Those running a negative split tend to speed
    up (relative final pace < 1) on average, while those running a positive split
    tend to slow down (relative final pace > 1).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Importantly, negative splits in the range -0.2<RHS<0 have an average relative
    final pace of 0.89 (which corresponds to an 11% speed up), whereas the average
    relative pace for positive splits (0<RHS<0.2) is just 1.07 (a 7% slow down). In
    other words, in the final stages of the marathon, moderate negative splitters
    tend to speed up by more than corresponding positive splitters slow down, and
    while the positive splitters are all but guaranteed to finish depleted (they can’t
    even speed up with the end in sight), the same *may* not be true for the negative
    splitters. The performance bias against negative splitters is consistent with
    this likelihood.

    final pace = 1) between 0.005 < RHS < 0.03, suggesting this is a *pacing sweet
    spot* because runners in this narrow RHS range reach the finish line with nothing
    in reserve —they manage to maintain their pace but cannot speed up and don’t slow
    down — hence why we saw the best performances for this RHS range earlier in this
    analysis. In other words, a slight positive split in this RHS range is associated
    with faster finish times and more PBs because it gets the runner to the finish
    line with nothing left in reserve. With an even or more negative split runners
    have enough reserves to speed up, whereas runners with a more positive split (RHS>0.03)
    are slowing to early and have depleted their reserves before they cross the line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, this is not to say that a small positive split is without risk. Presumably,
    plenty of runners finishing the marathon with a large positive split (RHS>0.2)
    had a more modest split in mind when they started, but perhaps they judged their
    early pacing or race-day fueling poorly. The corresponding danger with negative
    splits is pacing the early stages of the race too conservatively. Figure 5(b)
    shows the fraction of runners who speed up (even by just a little) in the final
    2.2 km of the marathon and we see that female runners are more likely to speed
    up regardless of their splits. For example, among those running a 4% positive
    split (RHS=0.04), about 45% of female runners speed up at the end of the race,
    compared to just 25% of male runners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If speeding up at the end of the race is synonymous with conservative earlier
    pacing, then this may suggest that female runners are pacing their race more conservatively
    than male runners, even among those runners who are pacing their race more or
    less evenly. The idea that males are more aggressive pacers is not new but it
    is usually attributed to examples of extreme positive pacing, such as those [hitting
    the wall](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=medium+hitting+the+wall+barry+smyth&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).
    Here we are seeing evidence of conservative female pacing across the full range
    of RHS values. In Figure 3(a) earlier it is also evident that males tend to enjoy
    marginally better performance (relative to their PB) across a wide range of RHS,
    which is consistent with this observation about more conservative pacing by female
    runners. Perhaps there is some room for improvement for female runners by tweaking
    their pacing to be slightly less conservative?

    could argue that a runner’s A-goal might be to target a slightly positive split
    (90 seconds or approximately 1.5%) with a B-goal to keep the positive split below
    3 minutes (or approximately 3%). Outside of these splits (negative or positive),

    appear to offer recreational runners a pacing sweet spot, with the very best performance
    associated with races where second half is 1.5% longer than the first half. This
    corresponds closely to the [*controlled fade*](https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a38070581/why-you-shouldnt-negative-split/)

    what happened during a race, it does not tell us if this is what runners planned
    for or intended to happen. As mentioned earlier, some runners who start out planning
    an even or modest positive split probably ended up with a much larger positive
    split. Such is the nature of the marathon. Even with the best of intentions some
    negative splits probably turn into positive splits depending on factors such as
    training, fuelling, and race conditions.
