    the way. Perhaps a column in a data source doesn’t follow the naming convention
    I put in place, or a timestamp hasn’t been cast to the right data type. Instead
    of waiting to fix these issues further down the line, I make the changes as I
    see them.

    A few of the downstream data models are broken because of that “simple” name change
    I made yesterday. Now, I need to scramble to change all the references to that
    column downstream in the failing data models.

    you the flow of your data. You’re forced to be reactive, waiting until something
    breaks in order to know what changes are needed. Luckily, data lineage tools can
    help us avoid this situation and be proactive about dependencies.

- en: '[Data lineage](https://www.y42.com/blog/data-lineage/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=lineage_transparency_article)
    shows the pathway your data follows when moving through the pipeline. It highlights
    where it comes from, how it’s transformed, and what visualizations it’s included
    in.'

- en: Data lineage is helpful for knowing which data sources are used in a particular
    model and if any other models are referenced in the process. You can use it to
    quickly spot dependencies. It builds transparency into your stack, a key quality
    when it comes to producing high-quality data.

    Here are the top three reasons I recommend using a data lineage tool.

- en: Data lineage tools are perfect for showing you which data models depend on which
    data sources. [Column-level lineage tools](https://www.y42.com/product/catalog-lineage/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=lineage_transparency_article)
    are even more powerful because they show you the exact columns upstream that generate
    columns in a downstream data model. This is especially helpful if columns have
    been renamed across different sources and models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Column-level lineage tools are particularly useful when data engineers make
    changes that affect the ingestion of source data. They can reference the lineage
    of downstream data models to see what schema changes will have a major impact
    across the business. This will then allow them to work with the analytics engineer
    to minimize downtime for business users.
  prefs: []

- en: Analytics engineers can prioritize documentation and testing for the most important
    data sources and models. Without lineage tools, you are guessing on what will
    have the biggest impact. With them, you can focus on the data that is driving
    the most business decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lineage tools can also be helpful for business teams because they allow them
    to see which data sources the data teams use most. I’ve seen a lot of outdated
    Google Sheets cluttering up data environments because nobody knows whether they
    are important or not. Being able to see the lineage of tables from source to insight
    will allow business users to weigh their importance while keeping their data assets
    clean and up to date.

- en: Data lineage tools give you insight into which data sources and data models
    are being used to power key dashboards and reports used by the business. This
    will help analytics and data engineers get a better idea of the models being used
    every day to make key business decisions. When everyone is aware of the most critical
    data sources, things like schema changes, data type casting, and renaming can
    become more strategic. This helps everyone understand the full impact and potential
    downtime involved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When data and engineering teams understand how a data pipeline change impacts
    the business, they are more likely to communicate and be proactive about solutions.
    For example, if a data engineer changes a source schema without a data lineage
    tool, they may have no idea that it will break the marketing ROI dashboard. However,
    if the engineer has a lineage tool to see what depends on this source, they can
    notify business teams of the downtime.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open communication helps to build trust between data and business teams, which
    is essential for a data-driven organization. Better choices can be made when both
    teams trust each other. The business will have faith in the data stack and be
    able to easily verify the results it sees. What’s more, the data team can confidently
    make changes to the pipeline knowing they won’t break things, helping to drive
    the business ahead.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lineage tools optimize your data pipelines by drawing attention to the
    bottlenecks that occur as data flows from its source to the final product. Instead
    of *wondering* why certain transformations are taking forever to run, or even
    why they are costing you so much money, you can see the exact flow of your data.

    the size of the data and the complexity of the query. You look at the lineage
    for these models and notice they reference the same source dataset. After looking
    into that source, you can immediately identify the issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lineage tools allow you to understand how dependencies between different pieces
    work and how you can improve them. Seeing how your data flows through different
    models enables you to easily identify areas where they can be optimized. This
    allows you to create a faster, cheaper, and more reliable data pipeline.

- en: When you update one of your source data models, you should always reference
    your data lineage tool first. Look to see what downstream data models are using
    that source. Which columns from that source are being used? This is where a [column-level
    lineage tool](https://www.y42.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=lineage_transparency_article)
    comes in handy, like the one offered by [Y42](https://www.y42.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=lineage_transparency_article).
    Once you understand how changes to your data sources impact downstream models
    and dashboards, you can feel confident in making them.

    how this change propagates downstream. Now, I never get any unexpected production
    pipeline failures the next time my models are scheduled to run.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data lineage tools are powerful because of the transparency they bring to your
    data stack, data team, and collaboration with business stakeholders. Making changes
    is no longer a guessing game, as you can measure the immediate impact beforehand.
