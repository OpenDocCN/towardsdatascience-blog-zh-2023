    optics, and solid-state laser engineering. While being fully submerged in the
    field, and excited about what I’ve been doing, at some point I made a transition
    into the commercial data science industry.

    people coming from proper software development to academia (for financial reasons),
    thus there is no real production expertise in the first place. I should also mention
    that working on designing experiments, doing a literature review, collecting measurements,
    writing code to process them, and getting valuable insights — all at the same
    time is exhaustive. As a consequence, you just don’t have enough resources to

    in seconds. But doing it on the ground is a whole different story. If you are
    working with a pulsed solid-state laser with a decent pulse energy, and you know
    what you are doing, you will direct a laser beam to the high-quality optical wedge
    to get most of the pulse energy into a trap and work with a reflection of a beam
    that has only a fraction of the energy of the original beam. You will do so to
    protect the CCD camera from a disaster. But using a wedge will be not enough.
    You will install an adjustable beam attenuator, lock it into the darkest mode
    and then gradually lower the absorption rate until you get the correct exposure
    on your CCD camera.

    with extreme care due to the safety regulations: you have to wear appropriate
    protective goggles, use protective screens, etc.'

    you just pick a random shot and capture the image? Or should you produce the average
    image using a certain number of pulses? Oh, the averaging was enabled by default
    by the software managing the CCD camera?

    data was measured or recorded, which tools were used, and even why it happened
    in the first place)**.** Both are golden when it comes to working with real-life
    data. Because it allows you to be way more efficient in producing the actual impact
