  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data augmentation is the process of applying randomized alterations (e.g. translating,
    rotating, flipping, stretching, shearing, etc.) to the input images in order to
    increase the variability. This process allows our model to better generalize by
    introducing minor shifts to the input data, as long as the modified images remain
    within the realm of possible inputs.
