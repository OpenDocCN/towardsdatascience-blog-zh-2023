- en: Regression is a vast world. We can do several types of regression analysis depending
    on the data type. We have covered logistic regression in detail in the previous
    articles. In this article, I will go through Poisson regression and implement
    it with an example in R.

- en: Linear regression can be done on numeric data and logistic regression on categorical
    data. We can perform simple binary logistic regression as well as multiple logistic
    regression on the dichotomous variable. We can select a partial proportional odd
    model or a generalized regression model depending on the requirement. But oftentimes
    we need to deal with data where counting is measured. For example, the number
    of visits to a museum can be collected from a survey, and in order to model that
    count response variable, we need Poisson regression. Other types of examples can
    be the number of visits to the hospital or the number of math courses students
    have taken during a specific time.

    the average number of events is equal to the variance of that variable. Therefore,
    λ = variance(x)

    that is available in UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.thearda.com/data-archive?fid=GSS2016&tab=2).
    According to the dataset, approximately 30000 people should be identified based
    on their demographic characteristics, such as their race, education, occupation,
    gender, salary, how many hours they work per week, and how much money they earn
    each month.

- en: It provides similar deviance residuals statistics which are very similar to
    the linear regression model where the deviance from the linear fitting line is
    measured. The coefficient for the regression model is shown next. Since we have
    only educ variable here, there is only one coefficient shown here. The coefficient
    estimate is 0.13486 and it means that for one unit increase in education, the
    log of the expected number of visits to a science museum increases by a factor
    of 0.13486.

    of the incidence rate for one unit increase of an independent variable. This IRR
    value can be obtained from the exponentiated value of the coefficients.

    in the educ variable, the expected number of visits to a science museum increases
    by 14.437%. The associated p-value is <0.05 which indicates that educ is a significant
    parameter that can be used to predict the number of science museum visits.

    like to include the remaining variable to model the expected number of visits
    to a science museum and determine if they have any significant impact or not.

    significant variables to determine the number of visits to a science museum. For
    gender, we took 0 as female and 1 as male. The coefficient is 0.33612 which means
    that for one unit increase in gender (i.e. female to male), the log of the expected
    number of visits to a science museum increases by a factor of 0.13486\. For family
    income, the estimate is 0.57499.

- en: Observing the IRR values, we can say that gender plays a big role in determining
    our dependent variable. For one unit increase in the gender variable (i.e. female
    to male), the expected number of visits to a science museum increases by 39.951%.
    That means males are more likely to visit a science museum than females. The significance
    of family income is even more. For one unit increase in the faminc variable (i.e.
    less than average to higher than average), the expected number of visits to a
    science museum increases by 77.711%. This also means families with higher income
    are visiting a science museum more than families having lower than average income.
    Also, as mentioned before, marital status and full-time working status are not
    significant here.

    the Poisson regression model in R. We have taken a dataset from UCI repository
    and clearly pointed out the impact of some predictors on our desired dependent
    variable. This type of study is important to understand subtle discrimination
    in our society. Poisson regression is also critical in several engineering studies
    as well.
