- en: Producing a faulty analysis and guiding my organization in the wrong direction
    based on my results has been one of my greatest fears since starting out as an
    analyst. And to be honest, being exposed and called out on my mess even more so.

    and promoting wrong results and recommendations affects both the organization
    as a whole and at the same time poses risks for us personally.'

    or assumption-challenging results is not the right approach. In fact, these analyses

    it is vital to align on the goal the analysis aims to achieve, and the approach
    that is used to get there. Early on in my career I learned that analyzing a specific
    issue can mean very different things to different people: for example, does **analyzing
    the performance of a new feature** mean investigating which user segments use
    the feature, what actions (and possibly revenue) the feature drives or what the
    side effects for the rest of the ecosystem are (or all of this in which case we
    need to have a conversation around timelines as well)?'

- en: Whenever I start working on a new analysis, I usually put together a brief **analysis
    plan** and talk my peers and stakeholders through it to get early feedback. This
    early feedback allows me to validate my analysis plans early and course-correct
    if necessary. At the same time it also enables me to narrow my analysis down to
    the aspects that are really needed, rather than producing a very broad, work-intense
    piece that tries to cover every angle of a particular issue.

- en: The next step involves research into whether a similar analysis has been conducted
    in the past. Chances are that you are not the first one working on a specific
    topic, especially if you are working in a team of multiple analysts. Make sure
    to check whether somebody already looked into the same issue before you, and the
    methodology they used. This can again help to validate your approach, provide
    more inspiration for how to structure and approach your analysis and serve as
    a template to agree on deliverables with stakeholders.

    time to run the first queries and dive into the data. While there should be no
    surprises for stakeholders anymore in the outcomes the analysis is producing and
    the approach that is taken, there are still plenty of things that can go wrong
    while wrangling with the data: Using the wrong datasets, coding errors or logical
    mistakes, there is almost endless room for potential errors.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    results. Check and compare how other people used specific data tables and fields
    (*even if they investigated a different issue*): Is there a specific population
    you should not include in your analysis? Any exceptions or edge cases you should
    be wary of?'

    sure to compare these results to the ones you are getting. Are there big differences

    a different underlying assumptions, or could some data issues be causing the gap?

- en: As soon as an analysis takes on some shape, it is a good idea to continuously
    share your work-in-progress with stakeholders and peers to solicit early feedback.
    While it might first be a bit unsettling to present half-baked or incomplete results,
    this is crucial to identify gaps and potential follow up questions early on together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When starting to share out my work, I furthermore try to spot gaps and anticipate
    questions people might have when reading through my results and recommendations:
    Is there a particular drop off in a funnel where more clarity might be needed
    around why this is happening? Do my results line up with previous assumptions
    and if not, might there be additional context needed?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, presenting half-baked results does not mean presenting a sloppy
    piece of work that is hard to digest. The appearance of your (early) analysis
    not only helps to convey the current state and next steps, but also builds trust
    into the quality of your work. In my experience, it is definitely worth to put
    in the extra work to make an analysis look professional from the start even if
    still work-in-progress to facilitate ongoing conversation. This also helps yourself
    to lay out the narrative you’d like to build with the numbers you are looking
    into.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, having the right analytics culture is crucial to facilitate healthy
    discussions and building processes that help to minimise errors. This includes,
    but is not limited to, creating an open environment where work-in-progress can
    be openly shared and discussed, and the focus lies on co-elevating each other’s
    work.

    can be an invaluable driver for the quality of the work you and your team produce.
    First and foremost, sharing queries and code that was used to produce analysis
    results should be best practice within the organisation. Linking sources directly
    to the analysis outcome is a tremendous help in reproducing results and learning
    from each others’ approaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, making pipeline work and integral part of every analysis can help
    reducing complexity. I have seen analysts building various complex queries from
    scratch to derive the exact same metrics or insights time over time (and I am
    still guilty of it myself too). However, making specific metrics or data fields
    available to others by integrating queries into pipelines doesn’t only help to
    reduce complexity and workload, but also to standardize certain definitions and
    approaches, making results from different analyses easier to compare.

    in whatever we do. The strategies outlined above usually help to minimize this
    risk, but in some cases errors might still slip through. If this happens, it is
    important to learn from our mistakes and to be open about it.

    mistakes. However in many cases, it is also our team that can learn from our mistakes.
    Openly discussing errors and faulty results can help the next person avoiding
    the exact same mistake, and overall increase the quality of your team’s work.

    highly recommend considering to openly share it with your team as a *lessons learned*
