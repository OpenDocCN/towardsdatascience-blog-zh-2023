- en: Outlier detection is only part of the story. The real challenge comes in figuring
    out what to do with these anomalies. It's all too easy just to brush outliers
    aside, but there are a lot of nuances and factors to consider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blindly removing them can have unwanted consequences. While finding a certain
    type of outliers might suggest a more serious problem with data, detecting another
    type may not be a problem at all. Therefore, it is important for you not to make
    hasty decisions as they might lead to decreased data quality or bias in subsequent
    machine learning models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, we'll break down the issue from two perspectives. First, we'll look at
    appropriate courses of action based on the reasons for outlier presence, and then
    we'll discuss what to do depending on the number of outliers in the dataset. Let's
    get started!

- en: '1\. Cause of presence: error'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most frequent causes of outliers is human and equipment errors. Someone
    screws up the number of zeros, presses the wrong key, forgets to measure something
    (or measures it twice), or a faulty instrument produces inconsistent readings;
    a software glitch records incorrect data, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a data scientist, these things are out of your control as they usually happen
    during data collection. The first appropriate course of action is to try to correct
    these faulty anomalies. Try to fix that typo or change numeric values to common
    sense alternatives (like when someone is 200 years old in a survey, you change
    it to 20).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When correction is not possible or too expensive, there is nothing left but
    to filter them out because you know those are incorrect values.

- en: '2\. Cause of presence: Sampling errors'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statisticians and machine learning engineers use small samples to draw conclusions
    about a specific target population. However, data points that aren't from the
    population may leak into the collected sample during data collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, imagine you are conducting a study on the growth of apples from
    your friend’s orchard. The defined population of this study is all the apple trees
    in this orchard and the sample is 1000 randomly selected apple trees. But, as
    the fences between them aren't clearly visible, a few dozen trees from a neighbor's
    orchard make it into your sample.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the neighbor's apples aren't necessarily abnormal, they come from a different
    population and can possibly distort your entire study.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When outliers result from such sampling errors happen, removing them is the
    only course of action.

- en: '3\. Cause of presence: Natural variability'
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The world is full of surprises and uncertainty. Some outliers might occur out
    of nowhere and still be part of the natural variability inherent in the target
    population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples are people blessed with specific genes that make them extremely tall,
    very short, savants, etc., or animals that can jump unusually high or live too
    long relative to their peers… The examples are endless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take a large enough sample, you are bound to get oddballs that are naturally
    part of their distributions. They aren't necessarily problems but introduce variability
    in data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it is tempting to remove them (since they decrease the statistical significance
    of data), you can't simply do so for better metrics.

- en: 4\. Number of outliers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dealing with outliers will also heavily depend on their numbers relative to
    the dataset size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If they are only a few (below 1%) and you have abundant data, it is safe to
    exclude them for transparency. Of course, you have to discuss it with the people
    who collected the data or domain experiments to ensure they are not part of natural
    variability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are too many outliers that they raise suspicion, then, there is probably
    some unknown reason for their presence. Maybe they only appear as outliers relative
    to the majority but actually are key characteristics of the target population.
    In that case, the sample you are dealing with may not be fully representative
    of its target population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final case is that there are so many outliers in the data that they form
    a new cluster or a sub-group. Here, the same approach is recommended — analyze
    how the initial machine learning or data science problem was framed, how the target
    population and sample were chosen, and how so many outliers made into the dataset.

- en: What to do with outliers if you don't drop them?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Outliers are often dropped so that they don't skew the mean and standard deviation
    of features and ultimately lead to degraded model performance. But, in some contexts,
    outliers themselves are of interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some applications of anomaly detection include intrusion detection (cyber security),
    fraud detection, fault detection, system health monitoring, event detection in
    sensor networks, detecting ecosystem disturbances, defect detection in images
    using machine vision, and medical diagnosis. In these scenarios, the nature and
    presence of outliers are heavily studied to drive business, privacy, and medical
    decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you *do* decide to drop outliers to increase model performance, improve
    visuals or statistical tests, you should be transparent in your approach. The
    stakeholders (people who directly benefit or lose from the project) should be
    informed of the decision. Preferably, you should present two results: one with
    outliers present and one without.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are also some non-aggressive and lightweight alternatives to dropping.
    A popular method is *percentile trimming* where extreme values that are beyond
    the first and 99th percentiles are capped. You can easily perform the operation
    in Pandas or NumPy:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main goal of this article was to highlight the importance of taking proper
    action against outliers. In the past, you may have removed them blindly just for
    the sake of better metrics, but now, you can make more informed decisions based
    on the types of outliers and their numbers.
