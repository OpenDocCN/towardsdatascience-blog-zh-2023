- en: In the case of irrigation systems, low irrigation increases plant stress and
    reduces crop yields. But, too much irrigation leads to excessive moisture that
    fosters pests. An optimal irrigation process can save large amounts of water and
    preserve other resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One indicator that influences irrigation is dew point temperature. The dew point
    temperature indicates how much water is in the air. This, in turn, influences
    the irrigation process. So, forecasting the dew point is useful to support water
    resource planning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The relevance of dew point temperature spans other activities in hydrological,
    climate, and agricultural domains. For example, if forecasts indicate the possibility
    of excessive moisture, pest control treatments can be applied proactively. Forecasts
    can also be used to anticipate frosts, which are harmful to plants. In this case,
    farmers can adopt preemptive measures to protect crops.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Forecasting dew point temperature is also important in the context of energy
    management. In high dew point temperatures, people tend to use air conditioning
    systems to cope with high relative humidity levels. Forecasting these conditions
    can be used to predict energy demand increases. This helps improve the efficiency
    of the electricity grid.

- en: Spatio-temporal data is a specific case of multivariate time series. These data
    sets involve observing a variable, such as dew point temperature, in several locations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of data contains both a temporal dependency and a spatial dependency.
    A data point collected in a particular location is correlated with its lags and
    the current and past lags of nearby locations. Modeling both dependencies can
    be important to get better forecasts in each location.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spatio-temporal forecasting is usually done with techniques such as VAR (vector
    auto-regression) or STAR (spatio-temporal auto-regression). We’ll use a VAR approach
    with a deep neural network.

    Agriculture. More details are available in reference [1]. Among other things,
    the dataset contains information about the dew point temperature. This variable
    is captured in 6 nearby stations.

    VAR methods aim at capturing temporal dependencies among different variables.
    In this case, the variables represent the dew point temperature collected at 6
    locations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    window and then combining the results. You can check [a previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-transform-time-series-for-deep-learning-3b6abbbb3726)

    information as explanatory variables. Meteorological data such as the dew point
    temperature is affected by various factors. Their inclusion may be key for better
    forecasting performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    applied a stacked LSTM, but other methods have also shown promising forecasting
    performance. Examples include N-BEATS, DeepAR, or ES-RNN.

    This way, the model could improve the modeling of spatial dependencies among the
