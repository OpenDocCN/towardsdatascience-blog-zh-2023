    bottom of the funnel, where the capture of customers is easier to justify, especially
    in financially challenging times. However, by doing so, marketers often overlook
    the importance of brand-building and generating customer demand and attention
    at the top of the funnel. This mistake can be costly, erasing a brand's emotional
    connection with its customers. I've seen this first hand, where the CEO would
    monitor sales hourly and ask for additional email sends, promotional, of course,
    day after day. In our yearly brand equity tracker, you can see the deterioration
    of the brand value and perception.

    which is about driving immediate sales or conversions. In contrast, more successful
    organizations have realized that it's essential to focus on the entire funnel,
    including the upper and middle, which are more about building brand awareness
    and driving consideration for a product or service. This approach is called full-funnel
    marketing. It combines different teams, measurement systems, and KPIs to create
    a more cohesive and effective marketing strategy. With this approach, businesses
    can better understand how various marketing efforts work together to impact sales
    by looking across all stages, from consideration to customer journey conversion.

    in-quarter sales targets, marketers must approach their marketing programs' development
    strategically, and focus on customer engagement, brand loyalty, and measurable
    results. By adhering to these essential building blocks, marketers can create
    powerful and impactful marketing programs that achieve their desired outcomes.
    Let's dive into each one of the four pillars.

- en: In the past few years, there have been a lot of significant changes in the advertising
    world. Traditional TV ads have been the backbone of many campaigns to build a
    brand to last over time. Still, these efforts have been hard to track, making
    it difficult for marketers to get detailed information about how their campaigns
    have an impact. This is because traditional TV ads don't have the same targeting
    and tracking options as digital ads. This is good news for marketers, though,
    because digital TV allows them to track who is seeing their ads in a more detailed
    way than ever before. Marketers are now able to display separate ads for the same
    show based on customers' interests, demographics,s or any other attribute. As
    a result, ads are more relevant and personalized, ultimately making the campaigns
    more effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Additionally, there are new methods for measuring the success of brand campaigns
    that go beyond just basic metrics like how many people saw the ad and how often,
    focusing mainly on the reach of the advertising campaign. Today, the new data-backed
    methods can give marketers more insight into how their campaigns are performing,
    which can help them make better decisions about where to invest their advertising
    dollars. By combining these new measurement techniques with personalized ad targeting,
    marketers can create more effective and impactful campaigns that resonate with
    their target audience. Three specific callouts in the brand-building area:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***A. Addressable TV and audio***mean that TV and radio ads can be sent to
    specific households or people. With this technology, marketers can measure the
    effects of their ads in a more precise way and link specific ad exposures to actions
    that consumers take. In contrast, in traditional linear TV advertising, the advertiser
    chooses a network or a show to run the ad. Based on the product or service you''re
    trying to sell, panel-based research can help determine where and when to air
    your ads. The only way to figure out who your target audience is comes from general
    rules about which parts of the population are most likely to watch at that time.
    With addressable TV advertising, on the other hand, you might be able to show
    each target household a different, customized ad.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, addressable TV works by putting together information about customers and
    matching it to their private IP addresses in a safe way. Marketers can learn a
    lot about their customers by keeping track of the devices they own and how customers
    use them across devices, including the websites visited, the times they watch
    TV, and, of course, the shows customers like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**B. Brand Impact Measurement & Surveys** allow marketers to see how their
    campaigns affect consumers'' perceptions of their brand, focusing on upper-funnel
    measurement. In today''s world, consumers are more informed and aware of advertising
    than ever before. This means they are more likely to choose brands that share
    their values and that they have an emotional connection to. While advertising
    messages are essential, the emotional connection drives consumer behavior. By
    using surveys to measure the impact of their ads, marketers can better understand
    how to create messages that resonate with their target audience. This can help
    them build a stronger connection with consumers and drive more sales for their
    brand.'

- en: Brand impact surveys can reveal how ads affect consumers. Brand impact surveys
    cover a campaign's effectiveness by collecting data from digital, traditional,
    and hybrid touchpoints. Marketers can test social and display content in various
    formats and creative methods to evaluate their campaigns from start to finish,
    such as branded content and influencer marketing. A brand impact survey can determine
    if a media strategy is successful for brand building or a campaign.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These surveys reveal what people think and do using rigorous methodology, large
    sample sizes, and advanced modeling. Ad recall, awareness, and consideration can
    help brands measure campaign success. To determine each brand's KPI, surveys usually
    divide control and exposed groups. This approach lets marketers make quick, informed
    decisions that affect brand perception.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**C. Marketing Attribution** allows for another integral way to measure brand
    campaigns. With these tools, marketers can figure out within a customer journey
    which ads led to which actions from customers. This lets them find a more direct
    link between seeing an ad and what a person does and measure how their campaigns
    affect key business metrics like sales and revenue—ultimately helping to determine
    and adjust marketing strategies across touchpoints such as advertising, email,
    social media, and more. These "correlated outcomes" don''t have consumer discrepancies
    like qualitative surveys.'

- en: 2\. Connected KPIs
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As companies strive to maximize the effectiveness of their marketing efforts,
    linking key performance indicators (KPIs) between channels and stages of the funnel
    has emerged as a powerful way to understand better their campaigns' real impact
    on actual business results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take, for example, a company that wants to drive more traffic to its website.
    By tracking social media engagement rates (likes, comments, shares) and website
    traffic, the company can determine whether or not its social media engagement
    is driving more traffic to the website. Suppose the social media engagement rate
    is high, but website traffic remains low. In that case, the company may need to
    adjust its social media strategy to drive traffic to the website more effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, a company may use display ads to increase brand awareness and track
    the number of impressions served. By linking this KPI with search query volume,
    the company can determine whether or not the display ad campaign drives more branded
    search queries. If the display ad campaign is successful, the company may see
    an increase in branded search queries, which have a lower cost per click than
    generic product-category searches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Email campaigns are another channel for companies to reach their target audience.
    By tracking email open rates and sales conversions, a company can determine whether
    or not its email campaigns are effectively driving sales. If the open rate is
    high, but sales conversions remain low, the company may need to adjust the email
    campaign to better target and convert potential customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a brand advertises, it often uses multiple channels (like social media,
    email, or search engines) to reach potential customers at different stages of
    the buying process. Understanding which channels work best and which need improvement
    can be challenging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A connected view across Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can help marketers
    see how different touchpoints (like an email, an ad, or a website visit) work
    together to affect a customer's purchase decision. By tracking KPIs across channels
    and stages of the buying process, marketers can identify the interactions that
    have the most significant impact on the business's bottom line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once these essential interactions are identified, marketers can make better
    decisions about where to invest their advertising dollars to get the most impact
    for their money. By better understanding which channels and tactics are most effective,
    marketers can adjust or rebalance their marketing strategies to make the most
    of their budget and drive business growth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    business outcomes, companies can make more informed decisions and optimize their
    marketing efforts to drive greater ROI.

- en: 3\. New-wave Media Mix Modeling
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While media mix models (MMMs) have been a valuable tool for marketers to allocate
    their budgets across different types of advertising and marketing, they have limitations.
    One of the biggest drawbacks is their inability to capture short-term changes;
    for instance, changes in customer behavior like COVID-19 or changes in campaign
    outcome. This can make it challenging for marketers to make data-driven decisions
    promptly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leading organizations are modernizing their MMMs with additional inputs such
    as incrementality tests and multitouch attribution (MTA) models to address these
    limitations. Incrementality tests involve running a structured experiment with
    a control group of consumers who aren't shown ads, providing real-time and granular
    data on campaigns to help marketers assess the true impact of their efforts and
    adjust the attribution for a channel accordingly. Recent advances in technology
    and analytics have made it easier and cheaper to run tests to figure this out.
    These incrementality tests help determine which tactics or channels genuinely
    make a difference in driving customer purchases rather than just getting credit
    for a purchase that would have happened anyway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On top of that, MTA models can help determine where credit for a customer purchase
    should go. By combining this with audience-propensity scoring (essentially a measure
    of how likely someone is to make a purchase), marketers can better understand
    which tactics and channels are valuable in driving sales. Suppose a campaign on
    TikTok primarily converts people who are likely to make a purchase; it would be
    assigned a lower value in driving incremental sales (i.e., sales that wouldn't
    have happened without that campaign).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By modernizing MMMs with these additional inputs, marketers can gain a more
    accurate and granular understanding of their campaigns' performance and make data-driven
    decisions more promptly. This is essential for full-funnel marketing, as it allows
    marketers to understand how each stage of the funnel impacts the others for a
    complete customer experience. So, while MMMs have their limitations, modernizing
    them with incrementality tests and MTA models can help marketers optimize their
    spending and drive higher marketing ROI.

- en: 4\. Operating Model across the Funnel
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the three areas mentioned, full-funnel marketing also requires
    investment in the right technology and data infrastructure. For example, having
    a centralized data repository and a common data language across functions is crucial
    to ensure that teams work with the same data and definitions. This enables accurate
    measurement and attribution of results across the funnel and helps teams make
    better decisions based on data-driven insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To support data and technology, having the right talent and capabilities in
    place is essential. This includes a mix of technical and analytical skills and
    creative and strategic expertise. Training and upskilling programs can help bridge
    talent gaps and ensure the team has the right skills to execute a full-funnel
    marketing strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it's important to continually measure and optimize performance to ensure
    that the full-funnel marketing approach delivers results. This requires experimentation
    and testing to identify new insights and opportunities for improvement. It also
    requires a willingness to adapt and pivot based on changing market conditions
    or consumer behavior.
