    recent articles that sit at the intersection between data science and marathon
    running. In previous articles, I have focused on several technical challenges
    related to* [*visualising marathon training*](/improving-the-strava-training-log-4d2039c49ec4)
    *and* [*performance data*](/how-to-create-a-heat-line-plot-82f8038d1659)*. Here
    I shift focus to analyse (my own) recent marathon performances using some of the
    visualisation techniques discussed previously along with several performance metrics
    from the sports science domain. As such, this article provides a concrete example
    of my own explorative data science process, showing how relatively simple concepts
    such as (running) speed and effort can be used to explore more sophisticated contemporary
    physiological measures such as resilience and durability in order to better understand
    performance in the marathon. At the same time, it is worth noting that similar
    ideas are proving to be relevant in many other endurance domains such as cycling,
    triathlon, skating etc.*'

    the Dublin City Marathon (DCM) 8 times now — beginning in 2013 — and I have been
    fortunate to achieve several new *personal bests* (*PBs*) along the way, even
    as I have gotten older. My most recent effort this year (2023) was a [new PB](https://medium.com/running-with-data/my-irish-life-dublin-marathon-b83969278b73)
    on a cool, wet, late October morning. I crossed the line in just over 3 hours
    and 10 minutes, beating my previous best (2022) by more than 7 minutes.

- en: As a data scientist, I am very interested in learning from my race experiences
    and this year the scale of my PB was surprising and intriguing. I felt that a
    small PB might be on the cards — if conditions were good — but I was targeting
    a best-case finish of 3 hours and 15 minutes and 3:10 didn't feature in my plans.
    Was this performance a simple matter of trying harder and running faster? Or were
    other factors at play? How did my pacing and effort compare to previous races
    and PBs?

- en: In this article, I will consider several recent races to look at the interplay
    between my *effort (heart rate, bpm)* and *speed (*or *pace, mins/km)* as well
    as a more recent endurance metric known as [*durability [1]*, which is an emerging
    measure of physiological resilience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ2Ov5vAtA4),
    somewhat akin to what we might think of as *stamina.* While each new PB was the
    result of running faster (on average), my recent PBs were associated with lower-effort
    running too. Did I run too conservatively or were my earlier PBs run too aggressively?
    This is where an analysis of durability can be useful because it looks at the
    evolving relationship between speed and effort.

    2017; 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the pandemic. I ran most of these races
    in good health, except for 2019, when an achilles tendon injury prevented me from
    training properly. 2022 was unusual because my target race was the London Marathon
    — just 4 weeks before Dublin that year — and so my training, while good, was not
    necessarily optimised for Dublin. Yet I ran faster in Dublin. Go figure!

    — one I found online many years ago — tweaking the pacing in line with my improving
    finish times. During these years I trained largely on my own, apart from the occasional
    run with friends. I joined Kilcoole Athletics Club ([KAC](http://kilcooleac.com))
    in the spring of 2023— the best decision ever! — and ended up following the official
    club plan, training regularly with the best bunch of fellow marathoners one could
    ask for.

    in the future — below is a summary of the 16 weeks of training before each race.
    Usually, I ran about 4–5 days (55–60km) per week with 3–4 long runs (≥30 km) before
    my target marathon, except in 2019, when my achy achilles impacted my training
    and limited my long runs. This year, I logged a modest increase in volume (65
    km/week peaking at >90 km) plus some harder efforts in a few long runs.

    my race activities, including my average pace and heart rate data for each 1 km
    segment. To keep things simple, I used Strava’s [heart rate zones](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917077-Heart-Rate-Zones)

    in 2022 were also run about faster, especially during the early and mid-race segments.
    However, the later stages of 2022 did not go so well. They were slower than in
    2018, even though I was running harder, and most of these occurred towards the
    end of the race. This highlights 2022’s tough final 10 km. Slower but harder!

    than in 2022, mostly in the early stages, but always at an easier effort. My mid-race
    segments were also run with less effort than in 2022, but they were faster too.
    And the big win was my ability to finish 2023 much more strongly than in 2022\.
    The final 9 kms were 10–15% faster, compared with 2022\. I needed to run harder
    to achieve this — my average heart rate was about 1–8% higher for these final
    segments — but I was able to increase my effort during this late stage of the
    race, which I was unable to do in previous years to the same extent.

    but it also makes things more difficult to analyse. It’s always useful to have
    a single measure to point to as responsible for race performance and this is where
    *durability* may have a helpful role to play.

    important physiological characteristics — [*VO2max*, *running economy*, and the
    *fractional utilisation of ̇VO2max*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4388468/)[2](linked
    to lactate threshold phenomena) — but the standard [model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2022559/)
    [3] has largely ignored how these factors are prone to deteriorate during prolonged
    exercise. This has led one of the leading researchers in the space, [Prof Andy
    Jones](https://sshs.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Andrew_Jones)
    — who has worked with the likes of Paula Radcliffe and Elide Kipchoge — to propose
    [*physiological* *resilience* as an important fourth dimension of endurance exercise
    performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606604/) [4]], and one that may
    help to distinguish the best of the best (like Kipchoge) from others with similar
    VO2 and running economy characteristics.

- en: One practical measure of physiological resilience is so-called [*durability*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33886100/)*.*
    It isbased on the ratio between the internal and external workload for a runner.
    Briefly, a runner’s heart rate can be used as a measure of *internal* workload
    and their speed (m/sec) can be used as a measure of their *external* workload.
    Then the *internal-external ratio* (*IER*) can be calculated by dividing a runner’s
    heart rate by their current speed. A runner reaches their durability limit when
    their heart rate increases and their speed decreases. When this happens consistently,
    their IER will increase as the runner’s heart rate becomes *decoupled* from their
    speed. This decoupling is a sign that a runner has exceeded their current durability
    threshold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One protocol that has been used to [analyse durability in a marathon setting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35511416/)
    [5] involves defining a runner’s *baseline IER (bIER)* as their average IER during
    the 5–10 km segment of the marathon. This segment is chosen to ensure that the
    runner has had time to “*settle*” into their race. Then, a runner’s *relative
    IER (rIER)* can be calculated for a later race segment by dividing their IER for
    that segment by their bIER. Decoupling is said to occur when ***rIER >1.025***
    *for the remainder of the race*.

    green regions indicate that decoupling has not yet occurred. Decoupling (red region)
    only occurs when rIER>1.025 and remains there for the rest of the race. Notice
    that there are a couple of short segments where the green regions exceed the allowed
    rIER threshold but because these spikes are temporary (usually the result of hills
    or perhaps a water station slowdown) they are not classified as the onset of decoupling

    just after halfway (22 km) and the degree was very significant (an average rIER
    of 1.10, which corresponds to a *moderate* degree of decoupling). This was similar
    to my durability in 2019 when my training was disrupted by injury. My durability
    improved significantly for my PBs in 2018, 2022 and 2023\. Decoupling occurred
    much later in the race (≥30 km) and my average rIER after decoupling was much
    more modest (between 1.05 and 1.08, indicating a *low* degree of decoupling).

    decoupling, and therefore a lower degree of decoupling, in my more recent, well-trained
    races. Whether this was due to better training, better race pacing, or both, remains
    an open question. A [question that remains unanswered](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9388405/)
    is whether durability traits are sensitive to training adaptations, but it seems
    likely that certain training approaches may be able to reduce decoupling in well-trained

    of my recent Dublin Marathon races. It’s all too easy to conclude that faster
    races are better races but that does not tell the full story. Here we have considered
    pacing and effort (in terms of heart rate) and it is clear that controlling one’s
    effort is at least as important as sticking to a target pace to achieve a PB.
    Generally speaking, my more controlled efforts (2018 and 2023) were both examples
    of strong new PB times with very little evidence of the usual pacing deterioration
    later in the race.

    for our physiological resilience, as a way to better understand the interplay
    between pacing and effort. Certainly, my recent PBs are associated with significant
    improvements in my durability. Of course, what is missing from all of this is
    the influence of training, which plays a major role in our fitness levels and
    race-day readiness. We will look at that in due course …
