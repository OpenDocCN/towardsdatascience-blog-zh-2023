- en: Abaucin not only demonstrates promising characteristics as a potential antibiotic,
    but it also exhibits selective activity against *A. baumannii*, making it a narrow-spectrum
    antibiotic with minimal effects on other bacterial species. This specificity is
    crucial for minimizing disruption to the body’s natural microbiota (bacteria that
    normally live on our skin, guts, etc. and are essential to our well-being), which
    plays a vital role in human health. Even more promising regarding its actual use
    as antibiotic, the study reports that abaucin effectively controls *A. baumannii*
    infections in a mouse wound model, indicating its therapeutic potential.

    a dataset of molecules capable (or not) of inhibiting the growth of *A. baumannii.*
    This dataset was itself measured and reported in the same work. Subsequently,
    the trained model was used to make predictions on the Drug Repurposing Hub, a
    comprehensive, annotated resource of FDA-approved compounds, whose purpose is
    to allow studies whereby already approved drugs are repurposed for new treatments.
    Here the focus was on identifying structurally new molecules with activity against
    *A. baumannii*. This process led to the discovery of abaucin as explained above.

    each molecule into a continuous vector representation by iteratively exchanging
    local chemical information between adjacent atoms and bonds in a series of message-passing
    steps. By accumulating the vector representations of various local chemical regions,
    the model obtained a comprehensive representation of the entire compound. To augment
    the learned features, fixed molecular features were computed using RDKit, one
    of the most important libraries out there for cheminformatics. The final vector,
    incorporating both learned and computed features, was then used as input for a
    feed-forward neural network trained to predict the antibacterial properties of
    the molecule, as a classifier.

    small molecules, evaluating their impact on the growth of *A. baumannii*. The
    screening experiments resulted in 480 molecules classified as ‘active’ and 7,204
    molecules classified as ‘inactive.’ This dataset was utilized to train the above-described
    network as a binary classifier that predicted the activity of structurally new
    molecules. Additionally, the Drug Repurposing Hub, containing 6,680 molecules,
    was employed for further predictions using an ensemble of ten classifiers.
