- en: Data Observability is all the rage in the industry right now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vast amounts of data and endless Data Quality issues have led us to this stage.
    Gartner sees it in the "innovation trigger" phase and has at least 5–10 years'
    worth of growth left before it plateaus. This means there are plenty of untapped
    use cases for Data Observability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, let's look at seven of those use cases specifically to improve Data Governance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Predicting Data Issues
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically Data Quality processes have been reactive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reactiveness also came from end business users. This meant the data team
    lost a lot of credibility, whilst Data Quality issues caused havoc for the business
    teams. Predicting Data Quality issues can help you take proactive measures to
    prevent or address them before they arise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This leads to trust and reliability from the business teams and less burdened
    data teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: Applying an ML layer over historical Data Quality issues with
    relevant data points such as the system of record, pipelines, frequency of failure,
    time of the month failure, and types of failure will build a predictive model
    to help pinpoint Data Quality issues before they arise.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Intelligently Triaging Data Issues
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding a Data Quality issue is the easy half of the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding someone who understands the problem and then can subsequently fix the
    problem is a more significant challenge. Rapidly triaging the Data Quality issue
    and routing the problem to the most effective team can reduce the total downtime
    by 60%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This avoids the endless Slack messages and conference calls to find the right
    person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: Create a list of data owners, custodians and application owners
    in a reference data table, along with the types of Data Quality issues they usually
    resolve if you have the budget apply an ML layer on top, which learns which teams
    are typically involved in resolving issues. Now use the Data Quality issue categorisation
    to route this to the right team.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Improving Data Pipeline Efficiencies
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Observing the data is more than just fixing Data Quality issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding core engineering problems, such as inefficient pipelines, is another
    use case that can be improved using Data Observability. If the processing times
    are higher than an agreed threshold for a pipeline, it can be pinpointed to the
    engineering team to look at ways of creating efficiencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can streamline processes and reduce unnecessary communication and team
    time waste.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: Create a timeline threshold and apply it to available pipelines,
    use Observability to pick out anomalies, and direct those to the engineering team
    to identify the most efficient ways to process and analyse data processing times.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. Automated Data Cleansing & Resolution
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is nirvana.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an organisation's Data Observability capability matures, the ideal end state
    should be a human-less process. Known source Data Issues can be automatically
    cleaned each time they occur.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can lead to a seamless experience for the business users without impacting
    the data teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: An ML layer or a rule-based list of Data Quality checks and their
    resolution can be developed. This is then deployed along with the data pipelines
    to identify and correct Data Quality issues in real-time. This will also record
    all the changes in an outcome table should human intervention be required.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Data Access Management
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Observing data access is another way to improve Data Governance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Observability can help you monitor who is accessing your data and how it
    is being accessed. By tracking data access logs, you can identify unauthorised
    access attempts, suspicious activity, or potential data breaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This can help you take corrective action and prevent data privacy violations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: An Observability check can be implemented based on data lineage,
    including downstream use cases. Any access attempts not meeting the original intention
    can be flagged to the relevant teams to investigate.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6\. Tracking Data Compliance
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Compliance monitoring has been ad hoc historically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Observability can monitor compliance by ensuring that sensitive data is
    adequately anonymised before sharing. Tracking the lineage of the data can help
    understand how data is being transformed and processed throughout the pipeline
    and identify potential issues that may impact compliance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tracking real-time compliance can reduce the burden on the governance team and
    minimise cost pressure on the data protection function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: An Observability check can be implemented based on data lineage,
    specifically where data is shared externally. Any data not labelled anonymised
    can be tracked and, if shared, can be alerted to the relevant teams to investigate.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7\. Improve Privacy Incident Process
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding facts takes time when investigating a critical incident process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there is real-time visibility into potential data privacy violations, it
    reduces the fact-finding time significantly. Data Observability can collate facts
    such as data access, data anonymisation, and data breaches and improve response
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By quickly detecting and responding to these incidents, you can minimise the
    impact on your business operations and prevent further data loss or privacy violations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*For example: An Observability check applied in 5 & 6 can be used to answer
    the fact-finding section of the incident process. All Observability alerts and
    how they were dealt with can be another bit of information used to learn lessons
    from an incident.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conclusion
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The larger the data estate, the harder it is to manage. Data Observability is
    removing the pain of this management by introducing newer Data Management and
    Science techniques.
