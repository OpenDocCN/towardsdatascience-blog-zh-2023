    classification tasks using a dataset of wine samples. The Naive Bayes algorithm
    is a probabilistic machine learning technique based on Bayes’ theorem, which makes
    assumptions about the independence of features given the target label. To facilitate
    visualization of the separation of classes, we limit the model to only two features.

    To accomplish this, we begin by exploring the data and selecting features that
    effectively separate the classes. We then proceed to construct class prior distributions
    and class-conditional densities, leading to the ability to predict the class with
    the highest probability. The dataset used in this study consists of various features
    of wines, such as hue, alcohol, flavonoids, and a target class, and is obtained
    from the scikit-learn library [1].

- en: Naive Bayes is a widely used probabilistic machine learning algorithm based
    on Bayes’ theorem. It is particularly useful for classification tasks and is known
    for its simplicity and efficiency. Despite its name, the “naive” assumption of
    independence among features is not always a limitation and can often yield good
    results in practice. In this article, we comprehensively review the Naive Bayes
    algorithm, its variants, and its implementation from the first principles.

- en: We begin by briefly introducing Bayes’ theorem, which is the foundation of the
    Naive Bayes algorithm. Bayes’ theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis
    (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis
    multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. The Naive Bayes
    algorithm uses this theorem to classify new instances by computing the posterior
    probability for each class and then selecting the class with the highest probability.

- en: The basic principle of the Naive Bayes algorithm is to assume that the features
    of a given instance are conditionally independent given the class label. This
    assumption, also known as the “naive” assumption, allows for a computationally
    efficient algorithm, as it reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. However,
    it can also lead to a decrease in accuracy when the features are not truly independent.

- en: There are several variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm, each suited to different
    types of data. For example, the Gaussian Naive Bayes is used for continuous data,
    while the Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for discrete data. The Bernoulli Naive
    Bayes is used for binary data. In this case, we will be focusing on implementing
    Gaussian Naive Bayes.

    natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. In natural language
    processing, it is commonly used for text classification, such as spam detection
    and sentiment analysis. In computer vision, it is used for image classification
    and object detection. In bioinformatics, it is used for protein classification
    and gene prediction.

- en: In the Naive Bayes algorithm, the class prior distribution is a probability
    distribution that describes the probability of each class in the training data.
    It is a fundamental component of the algorithm, as it is used to compute the posterior
    probability of a class given some evidence.

- en: The class prior distribution is defined as the probability of a class, given
    the total number of instances in the training data. It is usually denoted as *𝑃*(*𝑌*=*𝑦𝑘*),
    where *𝑘* is the class label. The class prior distribution is estimated using
    the relative frequency of each class in the training data. For example, if there
    are 100 instances in the training data, and 60 of them belong to class A, then
    the class prior for class A is estimated as P(Y=A) = 0.6.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The class prior distribution plays a crucial role in the Naive Bayes algorithm,
    as it is used to compute the posterior probability of a class given some evidence.
    The posterior probability is computed as the product of the class prior and the
    likelihood of the evidence given the class, normalized by the marginal likelihood
    of the evidence. In other words, the class prior distribution acts as a weighting
    factor that adjusts the relative importance of the likelihood function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if the class prior distribution is estimated from a biased training
    data, it may lead to poor performance of the algorithm, particularly if the test
    data is from a different distribution. This is known as the class imbalance problem,
    and it can be mitigated by using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling,
    or synthetic data generation.

- en: In the Naive Bayes algorithm, the class conditional densities are probability
    distributions that describe the likelihood of each feature given the class label.
    They are used to compute the posterior probability of a class given some evidence,
    and are a fundamental component of the algorithm. The class conditional densities
    are defined as the probability density functions (pdf) of each feature given the
    class label. They are usually denoted as *𝑃*(*𝑋𝑖*|*𝑌*=*𝑦𝑘*), where *𝑋𝑖* is a feature
    and *𝑘* is the class label. The class conditional densities are estimated from
    the training data using various techniques, depending on the type of data. For
    example, for continuous data, the class conditional density can be estimated using
    the Gaussian distribution, while for discrete data, it can be estimated using
    the multinomial or Bernoulli distributions. As we stated earlier, in our case,
    we have continuous features and so we will explore the Gaussian approach.

- en: The class conditional densities play a crucial role in the Naive Bayes algorithm,
    as they are used to compute the likelihood of the evidence given the class label.
    This likelihood is computed by evaluating the class conditional densities for
    each feature of the evidence, and then multiplying them together. The class conditional
    densities act as a weighting factor that adjusts the relative importance of each
    feature for the classification task.

    among features, which might not be true in real-world scenarios. The correlation
    between features can help in improving the accuracy of the model. Therefore, incorporating
    a correlation between model features could help improve its performance. Furthermore,
    other algorithms that allow the correlation between features can be considered
    to improve the results.
