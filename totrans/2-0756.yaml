    may stem from OpenAI’s efforts to [align GPT-3 using human feedback](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/).
    In a climate of huge [political divisiveness and polarization in the United States](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/13/america-is-exceptional-in-the-nature-of-its-political-divide/),
    it seems unlikely that GPT-3’s generations are meant to reflect the opinions of
    the general American public. Rather, GPT-3’s outputs seem to represent a progressive
    and liberal subset of American values, which also happen to align with the more
    [socially progressive political opinions often found in the tech world](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/silicon-valley-politics.html).

- en: Both GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT were fine-tuned using [Reinforcement Learning from
    Human Feedback](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf), which means that the model
    outputs were influenced by the decisions of human annotators. One hypothesis is
    that GPT-3’s outputs reflect the values and opinions of the human annotators who
    provided feedback used for the reinforcement learning. There is currently little
    information about who the annotators were and what kind of (political, social,
    economic, work, etc.) background they had. However, it is likely that OpenAI (and
    possibly others from the AI safety research community) trained the annotators
    before they began their work. This implies that it is possible that GPT-3’s outputs
    reflect an amalgamation of political values and opinions coming from both the
    annotators and the staff that trained them.

    also equally divided. Since GPT-3 was trained on Terabytes of blog posts, opinion
