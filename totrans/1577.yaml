    (EPA) makes clear, there are other factors such as solar activity, and changes
    in the reflectivity of the Earth due to, for example, deforestation. There are
    greenhouse gases other than Carbon Dioxide such as Methane and Nitrous Oxide,
    too.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but it would be useful if we could plot these on the same chart. This is not completely
    straightforward because, although the x-axis for both plots are similar period
    of years, the y-axes are quite different. The temperature anomalies cover a few
    degrees Celsius, while the CO₂ emissions are between around 2 to 4 billion tonnes.

    we leverage the Graph Objects package that Plotly Express is built on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is temperature data and the second trace is the CO₂ data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
