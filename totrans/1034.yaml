- en: The focus of the AI industry has shifted towards building more powerful, larger-scale
    language models that can understand and generate human-like text. Models like
    GPT-3 from OpenAI have led the way, demonstrating remarkable capabilities. The
    motto of OpenAI for a long time was to make these models open-sourced. Unfortunately,
    they decided to go in another direction and the new models such as ChatGPT (or
    GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 are now closed-source. The proprietary nature and limited access
    to such models have pushed many researchers and developers to find an open-source
    alternative and contribute to it.

- en: This is where the significance of Falcon-40B lies. In the end of last week,
    the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) announced that Falcon-40B is now free
    of royalties for commercial and research use. Thus, it breaks down the barriers
    of proprietary models, giving developers and researchers free access to a state-of-the-art
    language model that they can use and modify according to their specific needs.

    the [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard),
    outperforming models like LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, and MPT. This leaderboard
    aims to track, rank, and evaluate the performance of various LLMs and chatbots,
    providing a clear, unbiased metric of their capabilities.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the core differences on the development of Falcon was the quality of
    the training data. The size of the pre-training data for Falcon was nearly five
    trillion tokens gathered from public web crawls, research papers, and social media
    conversations. Since LLMs are particularly sensitive to the data they are trained
    on, the team built a custom data pipeline to extract high-quality data from the
    pre-training data using extensive filtering and deduplication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model itself was trained over the course of two months using 384 GPUs on
    AWS. The result is an LLM that surpasses GPT-3, requiring only 75% of the training
    compute budget and one-fifth of the compute at inference time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Falcon-40B is English-centric, but also includes German, Spanish, French, Italian,
    Portuguese, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, Czech, and Swedish language capabilities.
    Be mindful that as with any model trained on web data, it carries the potential
    risk of reflecting the biases and stereotypes prevalent online. Therefore, please
    assess these risks adequately and implement appropriate mitigation strategies
    when using Falcon-40B in a production environment.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Falcon-40B, as a member of the transformer-based models family, follows the
    causal language modeling task, where the goal is to predict the next token in
    a sequence of tokens. Its architecture fundamentally builds upon the design principles
    of GPT-3 [1], with a few important tweaks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first modification is the implementation of rotary positional embeddings
    [2] in place of traditional positional embeddings. Unlike traditional positional
    embeddings, which utilize static vectors to represent the position of tokens in
    a sequence, rotary embeddings encode positional information directly into the
    attention mechanism. This allows the model to leverage relative positional relationships,
    thus leading to more contextual understanding and better handling of longer sequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Falcon-40B also implements a novel attention mechanism by employing multiquery
    attention [3] and FlashAttention [4]. Multiquery attention allows the model to
    generate multiple queries for each token, thus better representing the token’s
    relationships with other tokens in the sequence. Furthermore, the model uses an
    internal variant of multiquery, with independent key and value pairings per tensor
    parallel degree, which helps in dealing with high dimensional data by increasing
    computational efficiency. FlashAttention, on the other hand, is a recent technique
    that speeds up the calculation of self-attention, reducing the complexity of this
    operation and thereby boosting the overall computational efficiency of the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The decoder-block in Falcon-40B features a parallel attention/MLP (Multi-Layer
    Perceptron) design with two-layer normalization. This structure offers benefits
    in terms of model scaling and computational speed. Parallelization of the attention
    and MLP layers improves the model’s ability to process large amounts of data simultaneously,
    thereby reducing the training time. Additionally, the implementation of two-layer
    normalization helps in stabilizing the learning process and mitigating issues
    related to the internal covariate shift, resulting in a more robust and reliable
    model.

    It is basically the same model but fine tuned on a mixture of Baize. Baize is
    an open-source chat model trained with LoRA, a low-rank adaptation of large language
    models. Baize uses 100k dialogs of ChatGPT chatting with itself and also Alpaca’s
    data to improve its performance.

- en: Let’s start by defining a function called `measure_perf` to measure the memory
    consumption and inference execution time for a given model and prompt. To measure
    the peak GPU memory consumption during the function execution, we need to track
    the maximum memory allocated at any point during the function execution. PyTorch
    provides a function called `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated` for this purpose.

    and tokenizer will be loaded using the Hugging Face’s `from_pretrained` function.
    Note that the tokenizer is responsible for converting the input text into tokens,
    which is the representation that the model is able to work with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, a small detour about quantization. Quantization is a technique that allows
    reducing the precision of the weights used in a model, significantly reducing
    the memory requirements and potentially accelerating inference. As one should
    expect, it does not come as a free lunch, we eventually lose accuracy with this
    approach. Nonetheless, it is particularly useful when deploying models on devices
    with limited computational resources, or when working with large models that would
    otherwise not fit in memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recently, the integration of `bitsandbytes` and Hugging Face Transformers was
    released. This enables users to load models with 8-bit or 4-bit precision. Starting
    with the 0.37.0 release of `bitsandbytes`, users can load models in 8-bit precision,
    a feature supported by most GPU hardware. This is done using the `load_in_8bit=True`
    argument when calling the `.from_pretrained` method. The more recent 0.39.0 release
    of `bitsandbytes` introduces support for 4-bit quantization via the FP4 data type,
    a feature accessed through the `load_in_4bit=True` argument when calling `.from_pretrained`.

    These prompts varied in nature, covering fictional storytelling, descriptive writing,
    persuasive argument, creative invention, and a process explanation. In both configurations,
    the model returned coherent and meaningful responses, demonstrating the model’s
    capacity for diverse language tasks regardless of the quantization level.
