    to something between having a PhD in Quantum Mathematics and having an “I heart
    π” tattoo plastered across your back. Now my mum sends me ChatGPT memes and you

    Nowadays, you actually have to know stuff. So how do you stay up to date with
    what’s going on in the world of AI and Data Science?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While there’s already lots of great advice out there, I’ve found that many of
    the strategies recommended by others don’t work for me. As a Data Scientist working
    in industry, I have very limited time to spend on research, and it wouldn’t make
    sense to spend all that time pouring over academic papers and technical release
    docs. I need sources that are short, snappy and applied — sources that help me
    understand how to make use of new technologies in my day to day work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this guide, I’ll summarise the sources that have worked well for me. My aim
    is to highlight those that are helpful from an *applied* perspective (not just
    a business or research perspective). If you’re a Data Scientist or aspiring Data
    Scientist, my hope is that these sources will help you stay relevant and spot
    opportunities for innovation in your day to day work.

    of [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/), [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/engineering/),
    [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/tag/engineering/), [Meta](https://medium.com/meta-analytics)
    and [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/category/data-science/). The thing
    I like about these is that they’re super practical. Whereas a lot of academic
    research papers focus on the theoretical aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning,
    companies’ blogs tend to highlight how Data Science is being used *in practice*
    to tackle real-world problems.

    have to sift through reams of theoretical jargon or decipher hundreds of greyscale
    flowcharts. I can just get right to the heart of the issue and understand how
    Data Science is used to tackle the kinds of problems I’m facing in my day-to-day
    job as a Data Scientist.

    a common framework in Data Science that I personally have little experience with.
    I found lots of OK-ish articles online, and then stumbled upon [this](https://netflixtechblog.com/decision-making-at-netflix-33065fa06481)
    fantastic series on [Netflix’s tech blog](https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/).
    Not only did it answer my questions about A/B testing; it was also packed full
    of practical examples of how A/B testing is used at Netflix. This was immensely
    helpful for understanding not just the theory but also the practice.'

    and a whopping *95%* of what you teach. The accuracy of these specific numbers
    is by-the-by: the point is that if you solely rely on reading others’ blogs, you’re
    unlikely to extract the full value or retain all the information you’re reading.
    Starting a Data Science blog is an excellent way to consolidate this knowledge
    and reinforce the things that you’re learning. It forces you to think through
    things step-by-step and helps you gain a deep understanding of the subject matter.'

    light-hearted teasing from my colleagues. On balance, I reckoned that I could
    handle that, and that it would be more than worth it given what I’d gain from

    the alerts you get from services like Google Scholar or arXiv. When setting alerts
    on Google Scholar and arXiv, you can quickly become inundated with notifications
    and, if you’re anything like me, end up not engaging at all due to information
    overload. The great thing about DAIR.AI is that they perform the legwork for you,
    filtering to the most interesting and cutting-edge papers and giving you the option
    to either read more or quickly discard and move on.
