    than the individual directly. Examples of these are Paid Search, Display Ads,
    Paid Social and so on. Direct-To-Consumer(D2C) campaigns, on the other hand, are
    aimed directly at individual customers. These are Direct Mail, Email, SMS or even
    push notifications. Businesses in the banking and fintech space are capable of
    running massive D2C campaigns because everyone has the app. But nowadays, these
    businesses are looking to be efficient in their promotional spends (how?).

    a free first year — that is, no annual fee. From the second year of use, it charges
    a full annual fee. Over the past 3 years, they observed a low yearly retention
    rate with only 30% of the holders continuing the card after their first year.
    Flex decides to experiment with renewal offers for select customers to continue
    to grow their customer base. The problem is — this strategy can be costly if we’re
    not careful.

    incremental impact of a treatment on an individual’s purchasing behavior, rather
    than just the likelihood of the behavior. This way, you can target the customers
    who are most likely to be influenced by your campaign and avoid wasting resources
    on those who are not. This boosts the campaign’s return on investment and customer
    satisfaction.

- en: Propensity score matching (PSM) aims to match customers that have similar probabilities
    of receiving the treatment based on their observed characteristics. PSM can help
    in reducing the bias caused by confounding variables in observational studies,
    where random assignment of treatment is not possible. It involves estimating the
    propensity scores for each customer, which are the conditional probabilities of
    being treated given the covariates, and then matching treated and untreated customers
    with similar scores.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since we have 3 different treatments in the pilot campaign, I will use PSM to
    approximate an identical control group for each treatment group. Example — a set
    of customers in control group (who paid full annual fee) that are similar to the
    customers who received the *Annual Fee x 30%* treatment. And similarly, for the
    groups *Annual Fee x 50%* and *Annual Fee x 70%.* This would eliminate any confounding
    variables in an experimental setup we would be able to identify the true lift
    for each treatment group.

    models. I would also recommend packages such as [*psmpy*](https://pypi.org/project/psmpy/)

    I predict the CATE from each of them. The treatment with the maximum CATE will
    be the **best treatment**. If all treatments have a similar CATE (within +-10%
    of each other), then we pick the *Annual Fee x 70%* treatment (of course, we want
    higher revenue). If the maximum CATE is negative, then we don’t market to this
    customer (they’re a sleeping dog).
