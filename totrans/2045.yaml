- en: Many great developments in data science have been made in the last decade but
    despite these achievements, many projects never see the light of day. As data
    scientists we must not only show strong technical skills but also understand the
    business context, effectively communicate with stakeholders, and translate their
    questions into actionable recommendations that drive business value. Is this reasonable
    or is the business looking for the new unicorns? *In this blog, I will describe
    how the business has changed over the years, which will give a better perspective
    on what you may need to learn to successfully deliver data science projects.*

    in information that can increase revenue, optimize processes, and lower the (production)
    costs. This has led to a new field with new roles; *the data science field with
    data scientists.* But the needs of the business keep changing over the years.
    ***It is thus important to understand the needs of the business to know what you
    need to learn as a data scientist.*** *In the next section, we will first zoom
    out to describe how the data science field has evolved over the last decade. This
    can help you to know; 1\. what* ***was*** *important to learn, 2\. what* ***is***
    *now important to learn, and 3\. what* ***can be*** *important to learn for future
    endeavors. Let’s go back in time in the next section.*

    and mathematics that originate from decades of (academic) research and development.
    Many of the original core algorithms form the fundamentals in disciplines such
    as text mining, image recognition, sensoring, and time series. *In the early days,
    these methods were published without the accompanying code. To apply the method,
    companies hired scientific programmers to do the challenging and time-consuming
    task of method implementation.* But before writing a single line of code, there
    was usually a process of thinking why the effort should be taken, and what kind
    of results could be expected. Over the last decade, this has changed dramatically
    because companies such as Google, Meta, etc started open-sourcing their libraries.
    In addition, communities started developing open-source packages such as sklearn,
    scipy, and many more. An installation is now just a single line of code.

    something has changed. The business also needs data scientists that can communicate

    in the data science field. From *data steward, ML engineer, data engineer, statistician*,
    and many more. But when we talk about the real data scientist, there are basically
    two types; ***the fundamental data scientist and the applied data scientist.***

    and machine learning techniques to analyze complex data sets and derive insights.
    This person can tell you everything about the underlying data distributions, and
    can easily create (alterations in) algorithms/ methods that will solve the problem.
    These individuals usually accelerate in research and development environments,
    and academic institutions.'

    methods to solve specific business problems or to develop data-driven products
    and/or services. Usually, these roles accelerate in one domain, such as in text
    mining, image recognition, sensoring, or time series. Innovation is usually achieved
    by applying new methods on their domain-related data, and thus not creating new
    algorithms or methods.'

    In a recently published article [1] it is very well described what the most important

    specializations come together. Every data scientist has a different background
    and ***continuous learning is part of the deal***. This means that a personalized
    learn-and-grow path can be of great benefit which depends on your degree/starting
    point, experience, domain knowledge, background in math, statistics, programming,
    engineering, communication, and presentation skills. Discuss with your peers what
    you can improve and make a personal roadmap of what to learn and how to learn
    it. Note that taking random data science courses may be interesting but can be
    misaligned with the mission of the company or even your personal grow-path.

    need to do but it may require years and likely decades of dedication, hard work,
    and struggles at the same time. Invest in yourself, learn the fundamentals, go
    beyond shallow knowledge, specialize, and realize that success is the accumulation
    of many small steps from which the modeling part is only one single step in the
    entire process.

    important. Maybe you can make the most genius method but you need to effectively
    articulate the complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical
    stakeholders. **Problem-solving**: you should be able to approach complex issues
    with a structured and systematic mindset. Think critically, analyze problems from
    multiple angles, and propose effective solutions. You can easily practice by helping
    the community on websites such as *Stack Overflow*. While you grow in your career
    and seniority you should be able to **mentor and coach** developers. Provide guidance,
    share best practices, and help to enhance in their technical skills. **Be adaptable.**
    You should not stick to the one technique that you know but embrace new technologies,
    methodologies, and tools. You should be able to learn quickly and adapt to changing
    project requirements or industry trends. **Time management.** Manage your time
    effectively. Prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and balance competing demands.
    Stay focused on delivering quality work.'
