- en: Supply chain optimization is a vast area of research. There is a plethora of
    use cases within supply chains that would benefit from the application of AI/ML
    technology. Oftentimes, organizations struggle with where and how to start in
    this space. Supply chain executives are typically looking for areas where to invest
    the time and effort of their teams (which are already stretched) to derive the
    most value from these approaches. In this article, we explore a small but diverse
    set of use cases that can serve as a starting point for a supply chain organization’s
    foray into AI/ML. Supply chain leaders can expect to gain a high degree of cost
    and efficiency improvements from these applications.

    Deliver, Reverse Logistics and outline uses cases of *Demand Sensing*, *Supplier
    Segmentation*, *Equipment Failure Prediction*, *Delivery Time Prediction*, *Customer
    Returns Forecast* that map to the five components. Applying the criteria of economic
    value, tractability, results explainability, insights actionability, and application
    sustainability, qualitatively across the use cases, we also assess the overall
    benefit of implementing each use case.'

    technologies to bring efficiencies and reduced costs to different parts of the
    supply chain. It can be a source of strategic advantage to an organization by
    enhancing customer experience. It is typically supported by a combination of optimization
    and AI/ML technologies. We explore five use cases mapping them to five elements
    of supply chain management: Plan → Source → Make → Deliver → Reverse Logistics.'

- en: '1\. Short-term demand sensing (Plan): Inventory management is a critical supply
    chain activity. Working capital and storage costs are tied to inventory levels,
    which in turn, are dependent on accurately forecasting demand among other factors.
    A high level of forecast accuracy helps to reduce inventory costs and stock outs
    by driving the manufacture of the right quantity of product at the right location
    at the right time. This helps optimize inventory in warehouses reducing safety
    stock levels, thereby reducing costs, while avoiding stock outs that may lead
    to long-term business and revenue losses. An AI enabled application can identify
    patterns in customer orders and correlate certain leading indicators to the short-term
    demand to be more accurate than from traditional methods. With real-time orders
    information, we can automate demand predictions for the current and next month
    that are refreshed regularly.'

- en: '2\. Supplier segmentation (Source): Large organizations may have hundreds or
    thousands of suppliers that form an integral part of their supply chain. Different
    raw materials in varying quantities are sourced from suppliers. To reduce cost
    of procurement while increasing reliability of supply, it would be helpful to
    apply different strategies to different suppliers. Clustering suppliers into a
    few key groups would be beneficial in this regard given large number of suppliers.
    This type of segmentation will enable targeted contract negotiations on raw material
    prices, volumes and supply timing to optimize spend. An AI enabled application
    can segment suppliers based on features such as volume, price, strategic relationship,
    reliability to enable sourcing specialists to adopt similar procurement strategies
    for suppliers within a cluster. This segmentation can be refreshed on a monthly
    or quarterly basis to account for supplier changes.'

- en: '3\. Equipment failure predictions (Make): Unplanned downtimes due to reliability
    failures are common in manufacturing operations. These tend to stress product
    inventory positions and can lead to delays in customer fulfilment. Predicting
    when such downtimes may occur can help a facility either take actions to mitigate
    the risk of equipment failure or prepare in advance by building up inventory to
    account for the downtime. These predictions and consequent mitigation actions
    can help avoid stock outs and lost revenues and as well as drive investment in
    preventative maintenance options to avoid costly repairs. An AI enabled application
    can correlate equipment failures to key measurements (such as throughput, pressure,
    temperature etc.) for days or weeks leading up to an unplanned equipment failure
    and provide insights on the timing of failures. Depending on the granularity of
    measurements, the application may be run every day or every few days to assess
    the risk of failures.'

- en: '4\. Delivery time prediction (Delivery): On-time delivery to customers is a
    key metric to gauge performance of supply chains that directly impacts customer
    experience. Organizations measure this metric and actively attempt to improve
    it based on historical delay trends. Being able to predict delivery times accurately
    can help get the product to the customer at the requested time, thereby avoiding
    poor customer experience and lost business consequently and avoid penalties and
    other charges due to late deliveries. An AI enabled application can be used to
    predict delivery times based on start day and time, season, carrier, source, and
    destination among other attributes. Such a prediction for each shipment will enable
    keeping the customer informed and enhance customer experience and retention. Furthermore,
    this presents an opportunity to optimize the routes and select the better performing
    carriers.'

- en: '5\. Customer returns forecast (Reverse Logistics): A percentage of sales is
    returned by customers for a variety of reasons including not meeting quality specifications
    or delays in shipping. To prepare for returns shipments, storage and processing,
    companies need to have an accurate estimate of volume of products coming back.
    This will help in reducing storage and processing costs. An AI enabled application
    can provide an aggregate volume of returns as a function of past several weeks
    of customer shipments. This prediction can be updated on a weekly basis.'

- en: 'We view these use cases through the lens of five key criteria: economic value,
    tractability, results explainability, insights actionability, and application
    sustainability. Economic value includes any cost savings or loss of revenue avoidance.
    Tractability refers to availability of data and a robust AI/ML approach to provide
    predictions in a reasonable amount of time. Results explainability indicates how
    readily the observations and predictions can be explained to stakeholders using
    business drivers. Insights actionability characterizes the extent to which the
    organization can act on the results of the AI/ML application. Finally, application
    sustainability describes the long-term viability of actively maintaining and refreshing
    the inputs for the AI application.'

    and *Delivery Time Prediction* due to the sheer volume of shipments. The sporadicity
    in taking actions for *Supplier Segmentation* and *Equipment Failure Prediction*
    lead to ‘Medium’ valuation while the relative lower volumes encountered in customer
    returns has driven the choice of ‘Low’ valuation.'

- en: '(ii) *Tractability*: With the use case data size and computational power at
    our disposal, most of the use cases are expected to be ‘High’ tractability except
    for *Equipment Failure Prediction*, that may be data limited if failures do not
    occur very frequently.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '(iii) *Results Explainability*: A recommended application of multiple linear
    regression for *Demand Sensing* and *Customer Returns Forecast* yields a ‘High’
    explainability rating. An unsupervised method (e.g. k-means clustering) when applied
    to *Supplier Segmentation* can show which features are close in each cluster and
    hence the explainability has been marked as ‘High’. Application of more complex
    ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest, Xgboost) for *Equipment Failures Prediction*
    and *Delivery Time Prediction* lead to ‘Medium’ explainability.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '(iv) *Insights Actionability*: Actionability is marked ‘High’ for *Demand Sensing*
    and *Customer Returns Forecast* since it is an internal decision to change production
    and processing based on forecast changes, while actioning *Delivery Time Prediction*
    and *Supplier Segmentation* insights would require negotiation with external parties
    including carriers and suppliers, where we may have limited maneuverability. For
    *Equipment Failures Prediction* with a ‘Medium’ actionability rating, we may be
    able to take action to reduce risk but may not be able to drive failures to zero
    entirely.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '(v) *Application Sustainability*: This is assumed to be high for four out of
    the five use cases since data may be generated at an appropriate pace allowing
    for frequent refreshes of the AI/ML application except for *Equipment Failure
    Prediction*, which may be data limited.'

    scores highest across all these criteria — the recommendation in this instance
    would be to start with an AI/ML application for this use case.

- en: The application of AI/ML techniques for supply chain and business optimization
    is still a nascent area in many industries. It is not unreasonable to take a “crawl,
    walk, run” approach towards integration of AI/ML into operations. Demonstrating
    the efficacy of AI/ML in generating value for a team via “low-hanging fruit” can
    have a flywheel effect. It is critical, though, to build on smaller successes
    towards a sustainable longer-term business model, where AI/ML is embedded in every
    aspect of the value chain.
