- en: In my career, I’ve noticed that the key to successful AI strategies lies in
    the ability to deploy machine learning models into production, thus unlocking
    their commercial potential at scale. Yet, this is no small feat — it involves
    the integration of various technologies, teams, and often necessitates a cultural
    shift within organisations, a system referred to as MLOps.
  prefs: []

    a flexible MLOps blueprint that can be a starting point or a means to fine-tune
    your current workflow. Although the MLOps journey can be complex, I strongly advise
    viewing it as an indispensable initial step in integrating AI into your business,
    rather than a secondary consideration.

    from my experience observing various MLOps strategies. MLOps is more than just
    technology — it hinges on three key components: Investment, Culture, and Technology.
    Companies that have considered all three from the outset tend to have more success
    with their strategies. A common mistake I’ve seen is businesses prioritising investment
    in solutions without considering requisite cultural shifts. This oversight could
    critically undermine your strategy, potentially wasting funds and diminishing
    confidence from your executives or investors'

    support from its people. A common pitfall I have seen is when businesses abruptly
    replace old tools with new, shiny ones without considering cultural change. This
    approach can breed resentment and result in these tools being overlooked or misused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the contrary, companies managing cultural change effectively have involved
    end users in crafting the MLOps strategy and assigned them responsibilities promoting
    ownership. Moreover, they’ve furnished essential support and training to upskill
    users rewarding engagement in these initiatives.

    efficient MLOps strategy should prioritise investments in both people and technology.
    A recurring issue I encounter with clients is the tendency to construct an MLOps
    strategy centred on a single data scientist due to budget constraints. In such
    cases, I generally recommend a reassessment, or at the very least, a tempering
    of expectations.

    Firms that fail to recognise this will struggle to build effective AI strategies.
    In truth, model development tends to be the most chaotic aspect of the workflow,
    filled with experimentation, repetition, and frequent failures. All these elements
    are essential in exploring new solutions; this is where innovation is born. Thus,
    what do data scientists need? The freedom to experiment, innovate, and collaborate.

    engineering best practices in their code writing. Whilst I don’t disagree with
    this sentiment, there’s a time and place for everything. I don’t believe that
    model development labs are necessarily the arena for this. Instead of attempting
    to quell this chaos, we should embrace it as a necessary part of the workflow,
    and seek to utilise tools that help us to manage it — an effective model development
    lab should provide this. Let’s examine some potential components.

    there seems to be this idea that data scientists develop models and then “hand
    over” to machine learning engineers to “productionise”. This approach doesn’t
    work and is probably the quickest way to lose your machine learning engineers.
