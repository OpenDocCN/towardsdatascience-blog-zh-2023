    eager to adopt Generative AI, from big to small, face a huge challenge in securing
    their LLM apps. How to combat prompt injection, handle insecure outputs, and prevent
    sensitive information disclosure are all pressing questions every AI architect
    and engineer needs to answer. Enterprise production grade LLM apps cannot survive
    in the wild without solid solutions to address LLM security.

    your custom taxonomy and see how easy it is to equip your RAG pipeline with the
    safety shield offered by the combination of Llama Guard and LlamaIndex.
