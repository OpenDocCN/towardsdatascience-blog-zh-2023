- en: The advent of large language models (LLMs) , trained on vast amounts of text
    data, has been one of the most significant breakthroughs in natural language processing.
    The ability of these models to generate remarkably fluent and coherent text with
    just a short prompt has opened up new possibilities for conversational AI, creative
    writing, and a wide array of other applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, despite their eloquence, LLMs have some key limitations. Their knowledge
    is restricted to patterns discerned from the training data, which means they lack
    true understanding of the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Their reasoning ability is also limited — they cannot perform logical inferences
    or synthesize facts from multiple sources. As we ask more complex, open-ended
    questions, the responses start becoming nonsensical or contradictory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address these gaps, there has been growing interest in retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) systems. The key idea is to retrieve relevant knowledge from
    external sources to provide context for the LLM to make more informed responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most existing systems retrieve passages using semantic similarity of vector
    embeddings. However, this approach has its own drawbacks like lack of true relevance,
    inability to aggregate facts, and no chain of reasoning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where knowledge graphs come into the picture. Knowledge graphs are structured
    representations of real-world entities and relationships. They overcome the deficiencies
    of pure vector search by encoding interconnections between contextual facts. Traversing
    knowledge graphs enables complex multi-hop reasoning across diverse information
    sources.
  prefs: []

    graphs can unlock new levels of reasoning, accuracy and explanatory ability in
    LLMs. This partnership provides the perfect blend of surface-level semantics along

    Knowledge graphs provide structured representations of real-world entities and
    relationships, encoding facts about the world and connections between them. This

    facts.
  prefs: []
