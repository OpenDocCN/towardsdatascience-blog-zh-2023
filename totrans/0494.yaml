    moments where it maintains a tendency to make up facts, to double down on incorrect
    information, and to perform tasks incorrectly. **Those incorrect responses are
    known as *hallucinations***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, giving incorrect answers is not the problem itself. The main issue
    is that ChatGPT often exhibits these tendencies in a convincing and authoritative
    manner. **Hallucinations are sometimes even present in the form of highly detailed
    information, giving a wrong sense of accuracy to the reader**, and increasing
    the risk of overreliance. And that is definitely a problem in the research community.

    was simply using the web interface, **imagine how powerful it could be after fine-tuning

    helper, others may allow the incorporation of such tools in concrete and delimited

    for your target domain, and much more importantly, being aware of the flaws to
    keep the critical spirit always alert!'
