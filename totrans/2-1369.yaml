    life, we give different, sometimes contradictory statements for the seeming same
    subject, that is because we see it from different angles. So what is interesting

    from different perspectives and fields of study, which are botany and nutrition.
    Acknowledging both answers will help you to better understand the structure of
    plants and improve the nutritional analysis of your meals. Same for logistic regression,
    in this article, we will try to understand why the two possible answers exist,
    and the reasons behind them will help you better understand the underlying structure

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the loss function log loss is used, there is equivalence with the logistic regression
    from the statisticians’ perspective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    y is positive or negative.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the logistic function is never used for the prediction of the class. But, since
    minimizing the log loss is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood, and the same
    result is obtained about the classification, we say that logistic regression has
    been applied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could imagine another name such as “log loss classifier” given to this particular
    combination of the linear model fitted on log loss. But it turns out that machine
    learning researchers usually don’t give specific names, but when there is an equivalent
    from an existing statistical model, then it is pointed out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    So, the order is different, here we first have classification with the decision
    function, then if needed, the probability can be computed.

    It is will be hopefully more clear with round 3\. For the time being, just think
    of SVM. Just like logistic regression, SVM is a classifier. And contrary to logistic
    regression, the probability calculation is not immediate. Well, you can apply
    logistic regression, but other methods such as isotonic regression also exist
    to compute the probability.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To conclude, despite the fact that statisticians and machine learning practitioners
    use the same name “logistic regression”, the model is actually different, and
    so is the output of the model. Statisticians consider logistic regression a regressor
    because the model tries to build a continuous outcome which is a probability.
    And machine learning practitioners consider logistic regression a classifier because
    the output is binary… Oh wait, but the output of the linear model is continuous.
    The classification part is one more step that they add when the model is fitted.
    Is the classification step really a part of the model itself? Let’s move to round
    2.

    a mathematical function that **directly** has a binary output? Well, it seems
    that usual mathematical functions always have a numerical output. And an output
    between 0 and 1 is the closest approximation to a binary output. So if logistic
    regression is still considered a regressor, then a mathematical function-based
    classifier may not even exist!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to clarify my statement, I am talking about the mathematical functions-based
    models or parametric models. For distance-based models such as KNN, or decision
    tree-based models, there is no debate to distinguish a regressor from a classifier.

    mathematical function of LDA? You cannot because the starting point of this model
    is not a mathematical function-based model. But what is surprising is that the
    form of the final model for classification can be very close to logistic regression!
    You can read [this article about the comparison of LDA vs. Logistic Regression](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/intuitively-how-can-we-better-understand-logistic-regression-97af9e77e136).

    perspective, I am not sure where the place of SVM really is. In the book Introduction
    to Statistical Learning, there is a specific chapter about SVM as if it is a very
    different modeling approach compared to others. And what is sure is that the classification
    is based on the rule over y: if y is positive, then the class is positive, otherwise,
    the negative class will be assigned. So from this viewpoint, we can apply the
    same reasoning for logistic regression: it is not a classifier, since the primary
    output of the model is not binary, but continuous, only after, a decision rule
    over y can be applied. However, it is commonly admitted that SVM is a classifier.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    closed. For machine learning practitioners, logistic regression is a classifier
    not because of any characteristic of the model itself, but because it is only
    based on the fact that the training dataset has a binary target variable. For
    statisticians, well, it is a regressor because there are no other choices when
    we try to find a mathematical function to model the binary output… Oh wait, when
    the output is from a real number, from negative infinity to positive infinity,
    it is a regression. When the output is from 0 to 1, it is also regression, maybe
    for statisticians, there are different types of regression. Let’s go to round
    3.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For statisticians, logistic regression belongs to a family of models called
    the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The base model is the linear regression with
    the function y = wX + b, and the term “generalized” means that various link functions
    can be applied to this simple linear model so that the resulting models can predict
    different types of output such as continuous, binary with probabilities as output,
    multinomial with probabilities as output, count data, or only positive value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then the estimation of the parameters of the models is done through the Maximum
    Likelihood Estimation (MLE). So according to the nature of the output, the distribution
    used is of different kinds with different support such as normal distribution
    with real number support, gamma distribution with only positive value support,
    Poisson distribution with integer support, and Bernoulli distribution with binary
    support (0 and 1).

    value has to be minimized contrary to the “likelihood” that has to be maximized.
    But in many cases, there is equivalence. And log loss is one possible loss function
    among others. It turns out that the use of log loss makes the model equivalent
    to logistic regression.

    equivalent to SVM. As I previously mentioned, I don’t know where the place of
    SVM is from the statistical perspective, but for machine learning, its place is
    quite clear: it is a linear model with hinge loss and L2 penalty. When statisticians
    say that it creates a hyperplane that does the classification, the truth is that
    the linear model with log loss, aka logistic regression, does the same, and in
    fact, it is true regardless of the loss function used, because it is the definition
    of a linear classifier: creating a hyperplane from the linear model!)'

    we can rediscover many things we thought we already know through different perspectives

    itself is a machine learning perspective. For statisticians, logistic regression
    is a model that belongs to GLM (Generalized Linear Model) and this framework considers
    more types of output such as count data, only positive output.
