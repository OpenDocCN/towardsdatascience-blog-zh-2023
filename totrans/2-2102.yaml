- en: Non-renewable energy sources impose a heavy ecological footprint on our planet.
    This issue prompted scientific and technological advances for clean energy sources.
    Instances include solar, wind, and ocean wave energy. These are friendly to the
    environment, unlike coal or oil.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons that delay the widespread of clean energy sources is their
    irregularity. They are highly variable sources, which makes their behavior difficult
    to predict.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, forecasting the conditions of these sources is a key challenge. Accurate
    predictions are essential for the efficient production of clean energy.

- en: Wind power is an increasingly established source of renewable energy. [As of
    2020, wind power accounted for about 47% of Denmark’s electricity generation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-denmark-windpower-idUSKBN1Z10KE).
    Other countries have increased their share of wind power in the electricity grid
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wind power also has some disadvantages. For example, the visual impact and noise
    of wind turbines. In addition, wind power infrastructure needs a sizable initial
    investment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The integration of wind power into the electricity grid is also difficult. Wind
    power can only be generated if the wind is blowing. This makes it an intermittent
    and unpredictable energy source. So, it needs to be coupled with other alternatives.

- en: Wind ramps
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wind ramps are also a major concern for power system operators. These are large
    changes in wind power in short periods of time (minutes to hours). If undetected
    timely, wind ramps can compromise the reliability of the electricity grid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wind ramps can be either upward or downward changes. When a sudden drop in power
    occurs, energy from other sources must be raised to compensate for the loss. Sudden
    upward changes can prompt operators to decrease the output from other sources.
    Or, instead, sell the surplus energy.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Power system operators rely on forecasting models to predict wind conditions.
    These models enable operators to balance and integrate several energy sources
    efficiently. Accurate forecasts are important for the efficiency of the electricity
    grid, and also to reduce costs.

    farm. So, we normalize wind power by the farm’s capacity. This leads to a measure
    of wind power as a percentage of the total capacity.

- en: We’ll build a forecasting model using machine learning algorithms. The idea
    is to apply a modeling technique called auto-regression. Auto-regression involves
    using recent past observations (lags) to predict future ones. You can read more
    about auto-regression in [a previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/machine-learning-for-forecasting-transformations-and-feature-extraction-bbbea9de0ac2).

    be done with a [method based on a sliding window](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/machine-learning-for-forecasting-transformations-and-feature-extraction-bbbea9de0ac2)

    feature extraction should be included. The particular [feature extraction process
    is based on lag summary statistics](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/machine-learning-for-forecasting-transformations-and-feature-extraction-bbbea9de0ac2).

    — almost perfect. Yet, performance decreases a lot as we make forecasts for larger

    case, these represent high or low wind power. Such values are important to anticipate
    because they can have an impact on grid operations.

    red dashed line is the ideal case where the predicted value matches the observed
    one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the most part, the data points revolve around the red line. But, for extreme
    observations, the points deviate from the line. So, the model sometimes fails
    to anticipate extreme values.
