- en: More than 10 years ago when I started my data career as a GIS (Geographic Information
    System) analyst, two pieces of do-it-all GIS software were prominent. 10 years
    later, it is still the same two software. [**ArcGIS**](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview)
    by **ERSI** is by far the dominant king, which is very easy to use with many features
    and an excellent Python library that came with it. However, it costs money and
    only works on Windows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[**QGIS**](https://qgis.org/en/site/) (Quantum GIS) on the other hand is the
    best open-source alternative. It ships to most operating systems and has a very
    active open-source community. You won’t do wrong committing to either software,
    but as I went deeper into my programming career, using Windows became more difficult,
    and I generally tried to avoid enterprise software to avoid any procurement administrative
    work. Hence I deviate more towards QGIS now.'

    authoritative maps as the background to get a sense of the land details when we
    add our layers on top of it. In QGIS, base maps can be added by first installing
    the plugin at Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > QuickMapServices. These maps
    are retrieved via external APIs, so an internet connection is required.

    was made up of a grid of colour pixels, and this is known as a **raster**. This

    pixels.

    clear and sharp when zoomed in. These vectors are made up of various geometry
    types, i.e., polyline, polygon, and point. The most common format for vector storage
    in GIS is an ESRI **shapefile**. To create this go to Layer > Create Layer > New
    Shapefile Layer.'
