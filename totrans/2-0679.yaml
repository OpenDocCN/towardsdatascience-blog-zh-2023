- en: Just recently, the owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, John Fischer,
    announced that the team had purchased close to 50 acres of land in Las Vegas,
    Nevada. [1] This puts the future of Oakland’s last remaining professional sports
    team in jeopardy. In the last 5 years, Oakland has seen the Golden State Warriors
    (NBA) and Las Vegas Raiders (NFL) depart for newer shinier stadiums in other cities
    (although, Golden State just went across the Bay Bridge to San Francsico). While
    the decision-making process in the Oakland A’s front office remains a mystery
    to me, data science and decision analysis in tandem can reveal a great deal about
    John Fischer’s motives to move to Las Vegas.

    it is the bridge between the highly technical work of probability and statistical
    models and business decisions. Understanding how business decisions are made can
    help frame our work and the presentation of our findings to non-technical audiences
    as we provide actionable recommendations and findings. The Institute for Operations
    Research and Management Science (INFORMS) even has an [entire society dedicated

    we assume a rational (aka expected value) decision maker. So, we start by tabulating
    the value associated with the terminal state, if applicable. This will become
    our running total or expected value. In this case, it is not applicable, so we
    start with a total of $0\. Then, we iteratively calculate the expected value of
    each set of nodes to the left of the terminal nodes and add it to the running
    total or expected value. In the end, we will end up with one expected value of
    the decision to stay in Oakland and one expected value of the decision to move

    of whether the A’s should stay put in Oakland or move to Las Vegas rested first
    on the probability of optimistic RSN revenue and then on the probabilities associated
    with Oakland ticket sales.

- en: Interestingly, despite all of the media chatter about public or private funding
    for a new stadium, our model points to RSN revenue and ticket sales. The difference
    could be due to our 10 year time horizon or could be due to the organization looking
    for an MLB-approved excuse to leave Oakland. Either way, *this approach highlights
    an important insight that a data science team can take to decision makers in order
    to inform business strategy.* Methods like this can take your model from interesting
    theoretical exercise to changing minds in the C-suite.

    A’s baseball team to rolling back a decision analysis decision tree model to unveil
    why the A’s might be heading to Las Vegas to leveraging a machine learning decision
    tree to generalize our results into digestible business rules that management
    can use to decide whether or not to re-locate. Hopefully, you’ll be able to utilize
    a similar methodology or approach in order to inform decision makers in your own
    organization or in your daily life.
