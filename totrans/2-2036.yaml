    who came before us. So, when we see the wealth of public climate data, and how
    it is shared globally, we are standing on the metaphorical shoulders of climate
    data giants whom freely share climate data for the broader public good.

    data is hidden from public view. Data that organizations have transformed and

    the case. Rather, the “hidden” nature is a consequence of the transformation,

    is not available. It is proprietary. It is closed. Thus, it is hidden.
