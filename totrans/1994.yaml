    I just noticed that here on Medium, my community of followers is 70% the size
    of [Barack Obama’s](https://bit.ly/obamamedium). Whoa!

- en: I’m honored and humbled by all the love this amazing community has given me.
    I don’t know if it’s despite my being a cheerful weirdo or because of it, but
    thank you! And thank you for being unresponsive to my job title when I turned
    it off and on at random several times, with no effect on any of the metrics —
    it means a lot that you’re here for my thoughts and not my labels. Especially
    since it has been almost 10 years since I’ve had a career change and who knows
    what kind of madcap adventure I’ll pick when I eventually decide that a change
    is as good as a holiday.

    I’ve published over 180 blog posts, many of you have told me you’re drowning in
    all my content and I need to index it better. Turns out it’s very confusing for
    newcomers to my blog to sort through all the different topics I write about. I
    hear you! Not everyone is here for all the things. Eventually, I’ll prepare a
    well-curated site to help you out, but in the meantime, let me take the first
    step towards a fix by adding standardized supertitles to all my articles. That
    way you’ll know what category you’re dealing with each time so you can dive right
    to the ones you care about and skip my musings on random esoterica. In essence,
    it’ll be as if I have mini-publications for you to chose from.

    head, they’re all about the same thing: [*decision intelligence*](http://bit.ly/quaesita_di)!*
    No matter how data-oriented the writing, it’s always founded on the principle
    of improving your real-world actions. Decision intelligence is about giving yourself
    the skills and tools to turn information (whether it’s your memories of lunch
    conversations or it’s your foray through a massive database) into better actions
    (decisions!) at any scale (from tapas bites to petabytes) and in any setting (from
    picking a college major to building an [AI system](http://bit.ly/mf-ml)). I find
    it perfectly natural to span this full range of topics — necessary, even, for
    any serious student of decision-making — though I’ll acknowledge that even with
    180+ articles, I’m barely scratching the surface of everything worth knowing.'

    [understanding your irrationality](http://bit.ly/quaesita_ebp), etc. This is the

    what kinds of things you might be doing that [cause your data people to quit](http://bit.ly/quaesita_hero),
    [whom to hire in what order](http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles), [how to build a data-driven
    culture](http://bit.ly/quaesita_sydd), and so on. I also include data science
    careers articles from the point of view of the aspiring team member, such as [interview
    questions to ask](http://bit.ly/quaesita_22)… which is a handy thing for the manager
    to read too (it sure helps to know what advice your people are getting about dealing
    with *you*).

    Machine Learning (MFML) course on YouTube](http://bit.ly/funaicourse) (the index
    is [here](http://bit.ly/mfml_index)), while others take on the [AI zeitgeist](http://bit.ly/quaesita_decades1)

    above, but skip this one.) This one’s for the (eternal) students. Some of you
    really love it when I pick a [random esoteric jargon term](http://bit.ly/quaesita_cursedim)
    and explain the hell out of it for you cheerfully so it feels intuitive. Yes,
    it’s super nitty-gritty! Yes, most of you don’t care about it! But this stuff
    is catnip for the, um, perhaps three of you who love to see [pompous terminology
    taken down a notch](http://bit.ly/quaesita_gistlist), [shiny new software prodded
    until it confesses](http://bit.ly/quaesita_unboxing), and [formulas explained](http://bit.ly/quaesita_mseformula)
    so a kid (or pointy haired boss) can understand them. So every now and then, I’ll
    amuse the four of us by showing you how simple we can make complicated things
    if we understand them deeply. This is also the place where you’ll find out [*why*
    a topic is where it is in the textbook](http://bit.ly/quaesita_bday). Both when
    it should be where it is and when it [most definitely shouldn’t](http://bit.ly/quaesita_lemur)
    (even if no one told academia yet).

    things I have to say about statistics. So many! And I’ve said many of them in
    a 10.5h secret course all about statistical decision-making which I haven’t put
    online yet (the [first half hour](http://bit.ly/statthinking) is available in
    bootleg form, but the bulk of it is waiting for a pro camera crew to capture it
    — until then, the only way to see it is by [inviting me](http://bit.ly/makecassietalk)
    to perform it live). Occasionally, I’ll elaborate on some of the things I say
    in the course and this category is where you’ll find them.

    minus all the topics that already got sucked into the more specialized categories
    above. If you’re a practicing data scientist, you’ll want to follow this category
    plus whichever preceding one most floats your boat.
