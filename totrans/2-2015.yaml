- en: Protein design and engineering are essential goals in molecular biology, with
    wide-ranging applications in various fields including medicine, biotechnology,
    and materials science. Scientists have been exploring already for some decades
    various approaches to designing novel proteins and engineering existing ones to
    fine-tune their properties. While physics-based approaches have had some success
    in finding amino acid sequences that fold to a given protein structure, the recent
    developments in deep learning methods have shown much higher success rates and
    versatility. In this article, I will outline four notable machine learning (ML)
    tools for protein design and engineering and their significance in advancing the
    field.

    biological sciences, the methods they introduce and even the projects themselves
    offer exciting opportunities for data scientists, machine learning practitioners,
    and AI researchers to think new ideas and ways to collaborate with chemistry and
    biology scientists who can end up applying computer science for good. Indeed,
    the tools I will discuss below demonstrate the power of applying different kinds
    of deep learning algorithms to tackle a particularly complex challenge in biotechnology.
    By leveraging these tools, professionals in data science, machine learning, and
    artificial intelligence can thus also contribute to advancements in medicine,
    biotechnology, and materials science, witnessing direct impact of their own field
    of expertise even outside of it!

    de novo proteins that have never been seen in nature. The tool is based on language
    models that have been trained on millions of diverse natural proteins across evolution
    using masked language modeling. These models generate motifs that link sequence
    to the design of the structure and can apply them in new sequence and structural
    contexts. ESM-InverseFold offers two generative protein design tasks: fixed backbone
    design and free generation. Fixed backbone design involves generating protein
    sequences by taking low temperature samples from the conditional distribution
    specified by the language model via Markov chain Monte Carlo with simulated annealing.
    Free generation removes the constraint on structure entirely and generates new
    proteins by sampling from the joint distribution of sequence and structure specified
    by the language model. ESM-InverseFold has shown high experimental success rates,
    producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography in
    67% of the evaluated proteins. As the authors show, the language model used in
    the tool is able to access a design space beyond that of natural proteins, generating
    novel solutions based on deep patterns of protein design, including structural
    motifs found in natural proteins.'

    probabilistic model that uses deep learning to generate diverse, complex, and
    functional proteins from simple molecular specifications. It fine-tunes the RoseTTaFold
    structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks to obtain a
    generative model of protein backbones. RoseTTaFold Diffusion generates protein
    structures by simulating the noising process for a random number of steps on structures
    sampled from the Protein Data Bank during training. The method generates new protein
    structures by transforming noised coordinates from the previous step into predicted
    structures, conditioned on inputs to the model, which can include partial sequence,
    fold information, or fixed functional motif coordinates. The method was trained
    using two different strategies: 1) in a manner akin to “canonical” diffusion models,
    with predictions at each timestep independent of predictions at previous timesteps,
    and 2) with self-conditioning, where the model can condition on previous predictions
    between timesteps. RoseTTaFold Diffusion can generate protein structures either
    without additional input or by conditioning on various inputs, and it can generate
    diverse protein structures with little overall structural similarity to any known
    protein structures. The method outperforms other deep learning methods for protein
    structure generation and has been shown to have state-of-the-art performance across
    a broad set of design challenges, including protein monomer design, protein binder
    design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding, and symmetric
    motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design.'

    and oligomers, including target-binding proteins and folds unseen in nature. It
    grows on the own groups’ previous work, Masif, a ML tool that predicts interactions
    from surface features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A surface-centric approach compared to the other methods, Masif-seed focuses
    on the surface properties of proteins and the interactions between surface patches.
    Its neural network outputs vector fingerprint descriptors that are complementary
    between patches of interacting protein pairs and dissimilar between non-interacting
    pairs. The matched surface patches are aligned to the target site and scored with
    a second neural network, which outputs an interface post-alignment score to further
    improve the discrimination performance of the surface descriptors. MaSIF-seed
    has shown superior performance in discriminating true binders from decoys on the
    basis of rich surface features, compared to other tools. In addition, it is presumably
    faster and more accurate than other methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The paper presenting the method describes several examples where this tool was
    used to design de novo protein binders to engage challenging and disease-relevant
    protein targets. The full protein design pipeline using MaSIF-seed involves several
    steps, from identifying target sites on the protein with a high propensity to
    be engaged by protein binders, then searching a subset of a database of surface
    fingerprints derived from fragments to find binding seeds that could target the
    selected site, and then transplanting them onto protein scaffolds that are compatible
    with the binding modes of the seed using specialized Rosetta protocols. Finally,
    the binder interface is optimized, and in practical applications the designs are
    screened experimentally to fine-tune the final sequences via mutagenesis libraries.
