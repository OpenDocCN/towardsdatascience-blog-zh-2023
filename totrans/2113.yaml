  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One problem concerns the access to data. Extreme weather events are the result
    of the interactions of many factors about the atmosphere, the ocean, and land.
    These factors can be difficult to model, or may not be readily available. Besides,
    extreme weather events are rare by definition. Machine learning models tend to
    struggle with data sets with an imbalanced distribution — [that is, when one of
    the classes is rare](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-tackle-class-imbalance-without-resampling-47bbeb2180aa).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difficulty arises because weather conditions can change rapidly. This
    means there’s a lot of uncertainty about the future. Forecasting models must convey
    uncertainty for effective communication. This aspect is important for policymakers
    and the public.

    sensing. But, we can also model extreme weather events based on meteorological
    data. We’ll use meteorological data captured by smart buoys to predict impending
    hail or thunderstorm events. This data is also collected by NOAA [2].
