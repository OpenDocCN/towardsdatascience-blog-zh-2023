- en: As Engineering Managers, we have all been tasked at some point in our careers
    to measure our team‚Äôs productivity; hence, we have a clear understanding of its
    complexities. **Software development is not a simple production line** in the
    sense that a developer can continuously and faultlessly produce and deploy software.
    It is an elaborate process that requires creative problem-solving and involves
    numerous variables, including changing business requirements, technology advancements,
    and the need to collaborate within and across teams.

    come to mind are: lines of code written or number of features shipped. Nevertheless,
    quality is a must-have complement to quantity. For instance, a convoluted solution
    may span across more lines than a clean and well-designed one. Likewise, the time-to-market
    of simple features can be much shorter than more complex requirements that realistically
    have a more substantial business impact.'

    measuring productivity at all is also a recipe for disaster. A familiar quote
    to many, primarily attributed to Peter Drucker, *‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt measure it, you
    can‚Äôt improve it‚Äù*, is very relevant here.

    [**SPACE**](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) is a practical and multidimensional
    perspective on developer productivity that proposes a new approach which guides
    leaders towards measuring and improving **factors that impact outputs** rather
    than focusing on these outputs in isolation.

    Managers create a positive work environment that results in increased productivity,

- en: Satisfaction is a measure of developers‚Äô fulfilment and engagement towards their
    tasks and the processes they use. Well-being presents an index of whether they
    practise healthy work habits. This dimension has become increasingly relevant
    as burnout has a range of adverse effects not only on individuals‚Äô mental health
    but also on a team‚Äôs morale and ability to deliver high-quality work. Managing
    developer well-being can help build resilient teams that can integrate sustainable
    productivity for the long term.

- en: Performance in software development is not just about the output but the end-results
    achieved. Factors such as code quality, customer value, and business impact play
    a role in determining performance, making it challenging to attribute to an individual
    developer, as development is typically a team effort. Thus, performance should
    be viewed as the result of a system or process, and the best way to track it is
    by measuring outcomes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A developer‚Äôs activity refers to the number of outputs or actions completed
    during working hours. Engineering managers can gain valuable but limited insights
    about productivity itself simply because some of these activities are intractable.
    For example, team meetings, mentoring, debugging, setting up a new environment,
    and writing unit tests that are not representative of functional areas. Therefore
    this dimension cannot be used in isolation and should always be balanced with
    qualitative information and other dimensions‚Äô metrics.

    team members. A team with a culture of transparency is likely more productive
    due to increased awareness of priorities and the work of others, facilitating
    better coordination of dependencies amongst them. Moreover, the flow of information
    within and across teams significantly affects the discoverability of documentation,
    which is essential for the proper alignment and integration of work.

    during their work day. However, minimising interruptions to increase efficiency
    may result in decreased collaboration, fewer opportunities to brainstorm and hence
    less creativity and breakthroughs that drive projects forward; as such, balance
    is critical here.

    by putting the **developers at the centre** of its focus. It ensures that all
    factors affecting a developer‚Äôs work experience are taken into account and given
    equal importance. It also puts emphasis on **continuous improvement** and aligns
    with the Japanese practice of Kaizen, recognising that even small, incremental
    improvements can have a significant impact on overall productivity and success.
