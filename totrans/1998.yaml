    on a quest that would forever alter our understanding of data and statistics.
    [John Arbuthnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arbuthnot), a distinguished
    Scottish physician and mathematician, set out on a remarkable journey, driven
    by an insatiable curiosity to fathom the intricacies of birth records. Little
    did he realize that his inquisitivenes would lay the groundwork for a statistical
    revolution.

- en: That was the straightforward question that intrigued John Arbuthnot in the 18th
    century. He wanted to understand if there was a reason why it seemed like there
    were more baby boys being born compared to baby girls. His curiosity led him to
    analyze a lot of birth record from London over many years. Essentially, he was
    trying to figure out if there was something natural or random about this pattern,
    or if there might be some deeper explanation for the difference in the number
    of male and female births.

    1629 to 1710, he gathered data on births in London. These records provided a rich
    and reliable source of data, capturing a significant portion of the population.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Arbuthnot’s dedication to accumulating this historical birth data laid the foundation
    for his later analysis. This extensive collections of records provided him with
    the opportunity to investigate trends in the sex ratio of births, laying the groundwork
    for his groundbreaking statistical analysis.

- en: Arbuthnot’s inquiry into the natural sex ratio of births formed the core of
    his study. He hypothesized that in a population, the ratio of male to female births
    should be approximately equal. In other words, he posited that there should be
    no significant bias towards one gender over the other in the long run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This hypothesis was rooted in the idea of a “natural” balance in the number
    of male and female offspring, which, if disturbed, might have broader implications
    for the survival and perpetuation of a species. Arbuthnot’s work was a precursor
    to the modern understanding of sex ratios in populations and the study of deviations
    from expected ratios.

- en: One of Arbuthnot’s groundbreaking contributions was his clever use of data visualization.
    In the absence of modern statistical software, he created a time series plot that
    vividly portrayed the annual excess of male births over females. This visualization
    allowed him to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

- en: As you can see from the plot, Arbuthnot represented each year on the horizontal
    axis and the annual excess of male births on the vertical axis. The plot resembles
    a roller coaster, with peaks and valleys, reflecting the yearly fluctuations in
    the sex ratio of births.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Arbuthnot’s interpretation of this plot was pivotal. He noted that, despite
    the roller-coaster ride of ups and downs, there was no clear long-term trend.
    In other words, while the ratio of male to female births varied from year to year,
    it appeared to hover above what he considered the expected or natural 1:1 sex
    ratio (dashed line). The period’s average was 107 boys born for every 100 girls,
    with peaks of 116 boys per 100 girls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand this in more detail, consider that if there were an equal number
    of male and female births, the excess would be zero each year. Any deviation from
    zero would indicate a surplus of one gender over the other.

- en: Arbuthnot’s pioneering experiment marked the birth of hypothesis testing. In
    addition to defining the natural hypothesis of an equal birth ratio, he performed
    a statistical hypothesis test, computed what we would now call a p-value (using
    a sign test), interpreted it as a measure of statistical significance, and boldly
    rejected the null hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'His initial hypothesis was straightforward: if the null hypothesis held true,
    meaning that the number of male and female births was equal, then this apparent
    excess of male births must be more than just a coincidence. He calculated that
    the probability of this happening purely by chance was infinitesimal. To illustrate
    this point, consider this analogy. We can equate the sex ratio results to flipping
    a fair coin 82 times in a row and getting heads on each toss. The odds of such
    an event occurring were vanishingly small, with 82 consecutive heads representing
    a probability of 1/2⁸². This exceedingly tiny number suggested that the null hypothesis
    — that boys and girls were born in equal numbers — was implausible.'

- en: Arbuthnot didn’t stop at revealing the statistical improbability of his findings;
    he ventured further. He proposed that some underlying force was at work, leading
    to a surplus of male births. He hypothesized that this force sought to counterbalance
    the higher mortality rate observed among males, suggesting a form of “provident
    Nature” at play. This possible explanation has been rejected in [modern theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sex_ratio).

    His data might have contained counting errors, and his analysis was limited to
    Anglican baptisms. However, despite these limitations, his core findings have
    stood the test of time. Today, the “natural” sex ratio is generally accepted to
    be around 105 boys for every 100 girls, validating Arbuthnot’s fundamental insights.

    only pay homage to a statistical pioneer but also unearth the roots of modern
    data science. Arbuthnot’s test of significance illuminates the enduring importance
    of hypothesis testing and statistical inference in our quest to decipher the underlying
    meaning of data. Aspiring data scientists, take note; Arbuthnot’s pioneering spirit
    reminds us that even in the past, statistical insights paved the way for a future
    where data-driven discoveries continue to shape our understanding of the world.
