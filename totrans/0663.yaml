- en: Recently, I had an opportunity to meet with a data science team from a large
    government agency in Australia. From what I could tell, the team consisted of
    highly skilled individuals in data science and machine learning. However, during
    our conversation, I couldn’t help but notice a common theme among the data scientists.
    They seemed more interested in discussing the latest algorithms to predict human
    behavior rather than discussing and defining the core problems they were trying
    to solve.

    the tendency to see everything as a data science problem. It’s like having a hammer
    and seeing everything as a nail. While algorithms and advanced techniques can
    be powerful tools, it’s essential to remember that data scientists should be problem
    solvers first and foremost.'

    skills in data science and why they should be prioritized over algorithmic techniques.
    I will also discuss why it’s critical to understand organizational readiness when
    proposing data science solutions and how data scientists can lead their organizations
    toward becoming more data-driven.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data science has the potential to provide valuable insights and solve complex
    problems. However, when data scientists see everything as a data science problem,
    they can become too focused on the data and the algorithms, losing sight of the
    real-world problem they are trying to solve. This can lead to incomplete or ineffective
    solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid this pitfall, data scientists should prioritize problem-solving. They
    should start by understanding the problem they are trying to solve, the stakeholders
    involved, and the business context. Only then can they determine the best way
    to use data science to address the problem effectively.

    than immediately applying machine learning algorithms to identify the most likely
    customers to churn, a data scientist should first investigate the root causes
    of churn. They might conduct customer interviews, analyze feedback surveys, and
    examine social media data to identify common themes. Armed with this information,
    they can propose a solution that addresses the underlying causes of churn while
    leveraging data science to predict which customers are most likely to churn and
    which retention strategies are most effective.

    real value to their organizations. They can address the root causes of problems,
    provide actionable insights, and make a meaningful impact on their company’s success.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While data science has enormous potential, it’s important to understand that
    not all organizations are ready to adopt the most advanced data science algorithms
    or solutions. In some cases, simpler solutions like pivot tables might be more
    appropriate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s essential to consider organizational readiness when proposing data science
    solutions. This involves understanding the organization’s culture, infrastructure,
    and resources. For example, suppose the organization lacks the necessary infrastructure
    to support advanced algorithms or doesn’t have a data-driven culture. In that
    case, it might not be ready to adopt the most advanced data science solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In these cases, it’s important to start with simpler solutions and gradually
    build towards more advanced ones. For example, a data scientist might propose
    a simple data visualization or reporting tool to help the organization better
    understand its data before moving on to more advanced machine learning algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By taking a gradual approach, we can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate
    the value of data science in a way that aligns with the organization’s needs and
    capabilities. This can help create a more receptive environment for advanced data
    science solutions in the future.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we join an organization and especially if the organization is at an early
    stage of the data transformational journey, we have an opportunity to lead our
    organization toward becoming more data-driven. This involves understanding the
    barriers to adopting data science solutions and working to overcome them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most significant barriers to data-driven decision-making is a lack
    of understanding of the potential of data science. Many stakeholders may not be
    aware of how data science can help them solve problems and make better decisions.
    It’s our job to educate stakeholders on the potential of data science and how
    it can help them achieve their goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another barrier is a lack of data literacy within the organization. This can
    be addressed through training programs and educational initiatives that help stakeholders
    understand how to use data to make decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there may be cultural barriers to data-driven decision-making, such
    as a lack of trust in data or a preference for intuition-based decision-making.
    These barriers can be addressed through data storytelling and other techniques
    that help stakeholders see the value of data-driven decision-making in action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By taking a leadership role in addressing these barriers, data scientists can
    help their organizations become more data-driven and more successful. As we discussed
    earlier, this may involve starting with simpler solutions and gradually building
    towards more advanced data science solutions. Ultimately, the goal is to create
    a culture where data is seen as a valuable asset and data-driven decision-making
    is the norm.

    and lead our organizations toward becoming more data-driven. This involves addressing
    cultural and organizational barriers to data-driven decision-making, starting
