    categories** he calls “**Mediocristan**” and “**Extremistan**.”
  prefs: []

    of its citizens is **no single observation will significantly impact the aggregate
    statistics** [3]. For example, suppose you weigh every tourist at the Colosseum
    during your trip to Rome and compute the average weight. If you added the heaviest
    Italian on Earth, this average would be essentially unchanged (+0.5%).'

    see an opposite statistical property. Namely, in Extremistan, **a single observation
    can (and often will) drive the aggregate statistics**. Consider the same tourists
    at the Colosseum, but instead of measuring their weight, you ask each their net
    worth and compute the average. Unlike before, this average would change *dramatically*
    (+2500%) if we added the world’s richest Italian, Giovanni Ferrero (the chocolate
    + hazelnut family), to the sample.

    have opposite properties from Extremistan (e.g wealth).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest problems in using STAT 101 techniques to analyze Power Laws
    (i.e. data from Extremistan) is quantities like mean, standard deviation, variance,
    correlation, etc. all **have little practical significance**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    if we take N random samples,** the sample mean will approach the *true* mean as
    N → ∞. This is true for ANY distribution (with finite mean): Gaussian, Power Law,
    Uniform, you name it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it turns out that **this asymptotic behavior happens more *slowly*
    for some distributions than others** (e.g. slower for Power Laws than Gaussians).
    And, in practice, where we (necessarily) have finite datasets, this can cause
    problems. Here, I highlight 3 such problems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever we want to compare two sets of values (*e.g. sales in April vs. May,
    traffic accidents in LA vs. NYC, patient outcomes in the control vs. treatment
    group*), we often compute a mean. This gives us an intuitive way to compress several
    values into a single representative number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This works incredibly well for data that follow a nice Gaussian distribution
    because one can accurately estimate the mean in small sample sizes (N=~10). **However,
    this approach breaks down** when working with data following a Power Law distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see this by comparing Gaussian and Power Law sample means as sample size
    increases, as shown in the plots below for N=100, N=1,000, and N=10,000\. Power
    Law and Gaussian sample means are plotted in orange and blue, respectively.

    the Gaussian. Even when the sample size is increased to N=100,000, the Power Law’s

    is shown in the plot below.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the median, minimum, and percentiles hold up relatively well. Meanwhile, the standard
    deviation, variance, maximum, kurtosis, and entropy can’t seem to settle on a
    single number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of this latter group, I want to point out the maximum because this quantity
    **might seem to converge in a small sample,** **but as N gets bigger, it can jump
    up by an order of magnitude** (as seen in the N=10,000 plot). This is especially
    dangerous because it can lead to a false sense of predictability and safety.

    a pandemic, the biggest pandemic in 100 years would be 10X smaller than the biggest
    one over 1,000 years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, the deadliest pandemic in the past 100 years was the Spanish flu
    (~50 million deaths) [4], soif deaths from a pandemic follow a Power Law distribution,
    then we can expect a pandemic claiming 500 million lives within the next 1,000
    years (sorry for the dark example).

    we saw in Problem 1, when dealing with Power Laws we may not have sufficient data
    to accurately capture the *true* statistics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This point is exacerbated when doing regression with variables following a Power
    Law distribution with *α* <= 2\. This is because an ***α* <= 2 implies** the distribution
    has an **infinite variance**, which blows up a key assumption of popular regression
    methods (e.g. least squares regression).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, when working with data in practice, one will never compute an infinite
    variance (the data is necessarily finite). This raises an issue similar to Problem
    1: **the results may appear stable but do not hold up as you collect more data**.'
