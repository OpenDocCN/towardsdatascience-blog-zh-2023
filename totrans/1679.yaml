    and also demonstrated how to implement the model in R. Moreover the prediction
    analysis using the R libraries was also discussed in earlier articles. We have
    seen the impact of single as well as multiple predictors on the response variable
    and quantified it. Binary and ordinal response variables were taken to show how
    to deal with different types of data. In this article, we will go through four
    more prediction analyses for logistic regression models namely Generalized Ordinal
    Regression model, [Partial Proportional Odd mode](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/partial-proportional-odd-model-in-r-dc5face36e40)l,

    the data included is information regarding the individual’s education, age, marital
    status, health status, gender, family income, and full-time employment status.
    Education, gender, marital status, and family income are to be included as predictor
    variables in the regression model for health status. Except for education, the
    predictor variables are all binary, which means they have either a 0 or a 1 value.
    Education is a continuous variable that indicates the number of years an individual
    has been educated. The following variables are considered for this regression
    analysis.

    an ordinal logistic regression and hold the proportional odd assumption. Suppose
    family income has a coefficient of ‘x’, which means that for every unit increase
    in family income (in this case from 0 to 1), the logit probability or log odds
    of being in a higher category of health status increases by ‘x’. As a result,
    we can conclude the following statements about this model.

- en: A proportional odd model is characterized by the same log odds across all levels
    of outcomes. Real-world data frequently violates this assumption, so we cannot
    proceed with the proportional odd model. As discussed earlier, two possible solutions
    to address this nonproportional odd issue are to have either a generalized ordinal
    model or a partial proportional odd model.

    we want to vary the effect of different levels of outcomes. We can first determine
    which predictors are violating the PO assumption and then place those variables
    after *parallel = FALSE ~* command. Here, we have placed marital status and family
    income as violating predictors.

- en: Multinomial regression is a statistical method of estimating the likelihood
    of an individual falling into a specific category in relation to a baseline category
    utilizing a logit or log odds approach. Essentially, it works as an extension
    of the binomial distribution when there are more than two outcomes associated
    with the nominal response variable. As part of multinomial regression, we are
    required to define a reference category, and the model will determine various
    binomial distribution parameters based on the reference category.

- en: In this article, we have covered prediction analysis for four different types
    of regression models. The partial proportional odd model can be considered as
    a subset of the generalized ordinal regression model since PPO model allows only
    a few predictors to vary their effect across different levels. The multinomial
    regression model is useful for nominal response variables which have unordered
    categories. Lastly Poisson regression model is good for the prediction of count
    variables. We have demonstrated the use of *ggpredict()* function in all four
    regression models and the interpretation of result as well.
