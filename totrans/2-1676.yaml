- en: As shown in the classification report and confusion matrix, the precision and
    recall for functional and non-functional water pumps are relatively high. However,
    the model does not perform as well with water pumps that are functional but need
    repair.

    pump of interest. After clicking the “Predict Water Pump Condition” the XGBoost
    model will predict whether the water pump with the selected features is functional,
    non-functional, or functional but needs repair. The results are outputted in the
    application.

- en: While the solution proposed does enable users to determine functionality of
    water pumps in Tanzania, it would be difficult to pitch it to clients since there
    is no existing solution that can serve as a reference. Thus, it is difficult to
    determine how much money would be saved with this model and to what extent it
    would improve accessibility to water.

- en: The project is conducted with the assumption that a false negative (i.e., identifying
    a non-functional water pump as functional) is more undesirable than a false positive
    (i.e., identifying a functional water pump as non-functional). However, this assumption
    is only valid if there are no significant limitations in terms of money and resources
    available for repairing and replacing water pumps.

    DrivenData provided no explanation with regard to what these values represent.
    As a result, the project lacked evidence-based strategies for processing the categorical
    features.
