    of use cases by interviewing business and analytics leaders. For your sector,
    you can cobble together an overview of use cases from external sources. Most success

    cases, and then refine this list with internal leaders.

    Finance & Accounting, the use case *fraud detection and prevention* uses real-time
    analytics and machine learning models on a combination of customer and transaction
    data to recognize patterns and identify suspicious events. Or under Marketing
    & Sales, as part of *marketing mix modeling*, the historic relationship between
    marketing efforts and sales performance is investigated to optimize the allocation
    of marketing budgets and usage of channels and tactics.

    owners can help clarify what data is needed. As your list of critical data inputs
    grows, you will reach a point where you can start grouping the data into data
    types or domains. Within sectors, and to a lesser extent even across sectors,
    these data types and domains are actually quite stable. Data domains that are
    almost always applicable include Customer (or the equivalent of the customer,
    such as student, patient, or member), Employee, and Finance, as most organizations
    serve some group of people, have employees to do so, and need to manage their
    budgets. Some other domains, like Supply Chain or Research & Safety Data are more
    specific and may only apply if the organization manages a physical supply chain
    of products and materials.

    the very first thing we did was to identify the use cases and the incremental
    revenues these use cases could drive. This now enables us to say something about
    the value creation that is dependent on specific data sources. Because if we know
    that a given dataset is critical for 3 uses cases that respectively are estimated
    to drive 2, 3, and 5 million dollar in incremental revenues, we can state that
    10 million dollars in revenues is dependent on this dataset.

    data sources, you cannot say that the two data sources together drive $2 million.

    Here, fitness-for-purpose should be interpreted broadly. On the positive end of
    the spectrum, it means that the right data is readily available, at the right
    granularity and timeliness; it is of a high quality and reliable, and the source
    system is never down. On the other end, it means that either the data asset is
    not there at all, or if it is, that the data is hugely deficient, unreliable,
    and/or incomplete.

    to work. Together with the central data team and the commercial team, we aligned

    criteria, and drafted a plan to address the gaps.

    increased by high single or even double digits. In any case, the CDO in question
