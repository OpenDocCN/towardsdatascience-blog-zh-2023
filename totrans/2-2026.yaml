- en: Storytelling has been a part of human culture for thousands of years, and it
    is no secret that people are naturally drawn to stories. Stories are a powerful
    tool for communicating ideas and information. They can evoke emotions and create
    connections that statistics and data alone, in all their abstractness, cannot.
    To succeed, Data Scientists must be able to create stories from their work. Where
    complex concepts, statistical models, and large amounts of data are the norm,
    storytelling is crucial to ensuring that findings are understood, remembered,
    and acted upon.

    into something relatable for our clients. Stories have a structure: a beginning,
    middle, and end that makes them easy to follow. They are relatable. They feature
    characters and situations with which people can identify. They create connections
    to other ideas and concepts, allowing clients to link new information with things
    they already know.'

    are wired to process concrete, tangible information that can be seen, heard, touched,
    tasted, or smelled. On the other hand, statistics and data are often intangible
    and difficult to grasp. For example, the statement that 44% of people believe
    that pizza is perfectly acceptable for breakfast [1] doesn’t feel very meaningful
    at first. Is that a lot? A little? But the statement that two of your five friends
    probably eat pizza for breakfast gives us more feel for the statistic. That seems
    like a lot to me! And if we wanted to nail down the statistic, we could make it
    even more tangible:'

    to try pizza for breakfast. If ten people attend, you could expect that 4 of them
    would happily eat their pizza!

- en: Abstract ideas become concrete and tangible by weaving a story around data and
    statistics. They are more easily understood and remembered. A story about a customer
    who struggled with a problem and was helped by a data-driven solution can evoke
    empathy and interest. In contrast, presenting statistics about customer satisfaction
    may only elicit a shrug. When presenting data, it is crucial to not only communicate
    the facts but also to connect with the audience and make the data meaningful and
    relevant to them.

    probability of churn — the loss of customers — for any given customer of our organization.

    be challenging to understand. Storytelling can break down these complex ideas
    into smaller, manageable parts, highlighting key insights. For instance, we could
    describe a customer with a high predicted churn probability who recently moved
    to a new location and has been using the service less frequently. By focusing
    on the impact of these pieces of information on the model’s prediction, we can
    help the audience understand the underlying drivers of the model.'

- en: '**Engaging the audience:** Data can be dry and dull, making keeping an audience’s
    attention challenging. Storytelling can make data more engaging by creating a
    narrative that connects with the audience. For example, we could highlight how
    a customer’s usage of our mobile app is a strong indicator of customer loyalty
    and how the model took this information into account when making the churn prediction.
    This helps bring the data to life and makes it more meaningful to the audience.'

    such as making decisions, implementing specific recommendations, or changing the
    way people think about a problem. In our example, we could tell a story about
    a customer who was predicted to churn but was successfully retained by the company’s
    customer service team. Maybe the customer recently moved and has been using our
    service less frequently but the customer service team was able to retain them
    by pointing to a nearby store location that the customer didn’t realize was there.
    In the future, we know that when a customer moves, we should send them details
    of nearby store locations for their new area. The story highlights the specific
    actions the customer service team took to retain the customer and shows how these
    actions could be used as a model for future customer retention efforts. This drives
    action by providing concrete examples of how the results of the churn model can
    be used to improve the business.'

    the audience remembers the key insights and recommendations. Storytelling can
    make data more special by creating a narrative that sticks in our client’s minds.
    In our recently moved customer example, we could give the customer a fictitious
    name, or if we have records of their communications with customer service, we
    could incorporate some of those into our story. This makes the story more real
    for the audience. It becomes a very concrete thing that they can visualize. The
    audience will better understand and remember the data long after the presentation.'

    more relatable, memorable, and impactful. By combining data with a narrative structure,
    we can communicate complex information in a way that is accessible and engaging
    to our audiences. Additionally, storytelling can help to drive action, and make
    data memorable, thereby ensuring that the results of data analysis are effectively
    used to drive positive outcomes. As Data Science continues to play a critical
    role in decision-making, storytelling as a communication tool will become increasingly
    important for data scientists looking to make a real impact with their work.
