    the background in the surrounding image is creating a dampening effect on the
    image. You feel that if the background did not exist or was slightly altered by
    incorporating changes into the particular image by retaining your picture, it
    would result in a high-quality image portrait of yourself.

    a better understanding of computer vision and artificial intelligence, it is possible
    to significantly increase the performance and quality of the background removal

    a particular image with Python. For this particular project, the version requirements
    are higher than Python 3.7 and lesser than Python 3.11 currently. The library
    that we will utilize for removing the background does not function with version
    3.7 or lower.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As per my testing, the rembg library did not work with the Python 3.7 version
    as the appropriate scipy module versions could not be downloaded. However, with
    Python 3.9, I had absolutely no issues running the programs in this article after
    the following pip install command.

    utilizing the u2net architecture for handling the task of background removal.
    There are several modifications of the architecture and many tested methods to
    provide optimal results. The rembg library also grants access to a GPU installation
    for faster processing. For further information and understanding of the following
    library, I highly recommend checking the official GitHub repository from the following
    [link](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg).

- en: Now that we have a brief idea of the library that we will utilize for the background
    removal project, it is time to import the two essential libraries for this project.
    As previously stated, the rembg library is our first preference to make the following
    task trivial and straightforward. More advanced developers can create their own
    neural networks for the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other significant library that we will use is the pillow library, which
    is one of the best libraries for handling tasks related to images. This library
    is often installed in Python by default. If not, it can be installed with a simple
    pip installation command. The necessary libraries are mentioned in the code snippet
    below.

    path of the image for which the background must be removed. The other parameter
    we will mention is the output path in the working directory titled “Image.png”
    for storing the transparent image without the background. The readers can choose
    any other file names and formats for the same.

- en: For the final background removal process, we will open the input image with
    the specified input path using the pillow library. We will use the remove functionality
    of the rembg library to then eliminate the overall background of the corresponding
    image with just the dog, which is the primary entity of focus to remain in the
    image.

    section of the article to change and apply a new background accordingly. The readers
    can choose any desirable background as per their choice as long as the images
    are of the same size. Let us explore this topic further in the next section!

    might wonder what to do with the previously acquired transparent image. For this
    next step, we will follow a similar and relatively easy process. We will combine
    the transparent dog image with the above background. Note that any selected background
    can be used for this task. The only library requirement that we will utilize for
    this task is the pillow library for operating on the transparent image and the
    background picture shown in the above image.

    editing project. We will first open the transparent dog image, followed by the
    new background image that will be placed. The code snippet to open the following
    images is provided below.

    of the same size. The following operation of pasting the background onto the transparent
    image of the dog will not work if the sizes of the two pictures do not match each
    other. Hence, it is a necessary step to verify the size of the images and appropriately
    perform any resizing if required.
  prefs: []

- en: For the viewers following this guide step-by-step, if you have clicked on the
    provided images and downloaded them onto your working directory, you will notice
    that all the images are of the size 880 x 557\. If the size of the images does
    not match, feel free to resize them accordingly. The image sizes can be verified
    as shown below.

    the paste command of the pillow library. The first parameter represents the first
    image (The dog with the transparent background), the next attribute is the starting
    coordinates, and finally, we have the critical parameter, which indicates a mask
    of the respective image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The alpha channel is used as the mask which allows the user to merge the background
    with the transparent image of the dog. We can save the newly created image in
    our working directory. The code for performing the following action is provided
    in the code snippet below.

    while extracting the desired entity and posting the extracted dog with the transparent
    background into the new background. For more advanced variations of this guide,
    I recommend trying to fulfill these two tasks in a single project. The following
    guide can be transitioned into videos and real-time projects for background replacements,
    as in the case of a green screen to change backgrounds, as per the user’s desire.

    to view yourself in a different atmosphere or region can sometimes be an issue.
    It can be tedious to use expensive software to edit the background manually. The
    results from other free background removal options might not produce the best
    outcomes either. However, with AI and Python, this project can be completed within
    a few lines of simple code.

- en: In this article, we understood how to remove, edit, and replace your current
    background with your photo or the desired image of significance with the help
    of Python AI and a few lines of code. We make use of the pillow and rembg libraries
    to effectively remove the outlier background from the original image. Once the
    background is filtered, we can add a new desired background by using the original
    image and its respective mask.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make additional improvements to the project, I highly recommend expanding
    this project from images to videos and even real-time operations. For highly advanced
    learning, I suggest an attempt to learn and construct deep neural networks for
    performing the background removal task from scratch.
