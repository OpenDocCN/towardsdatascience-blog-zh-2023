- en: In 2017, authors from Google published a paper called [Attention is All You
    Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in which they introduced the Transformer
    architecture. This new architecture achieved unparalleled success in language
    translation tasks, and the paper quickly became essential reading for anyone immersed
    in the area. Like many others, when I read the paper for the first time, I could
    see the value of its innovative ideas, but I didn’t realize just how disruptive
    the paper would be to other areas under the broader umbrella of AI. Within a few
    years, researchers adapted the Transformer architecture to many tasks other than
    language translation, including image classification, image generation, and protein
    folding problems. In particular, the Transformer architecture revolutionized text
    generation and paved the way for GPT models and the exponential growth we’re currently
    experiencing in AI.

    but it will also cover the original Transformer at the end. For the model code,

- en: Before we dive into how to construct a GPT model, let’s start by understanding
    how we’ll invoke it. We’ll assume for the moment that we have a working GPT model,
    and focus on how to prepare the input, call the model, and interpret the output.
    The general idea is to provide a few words as input to kick-start the generation,
    and return text that is likely to follow that input. For example, if we give a
    GPT model the input “A long time ago”, the model might return as output “in a
    galaxy far, far away”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take a look at the code we’ll use to invoke our model, passing the input
    “A long time ago” and generating 10 new tokens. I’ve used comments to show the
    shape of each tensor. I’ll explain more of the details after the code.

- en: Since we begin with the string “A long time ago”, you might be inclined to think
    that a Transformer receives a string as input. However, just like other neural
    networks, a Transformer requires numerical inputs, so the input string must first
    be converted into a sequence of numbers. We do that conversion in the `tokenize`
    function using a *tokenizer* (`tiktoken` from OpenAI, in our example), which breaks
    up the text into chunks of a few letters, and assigns a number called a *token*
    to each unique chunk. To get the correct input for our Transformer, we place the
    sequence of tokens in a tensor and expand it to include a batch dimension. That’s
    because, just like other types of neural networks, a Transformer can be trained
    most efficiently by using batches to take advantage of parallel computations on
    GPUs. Our example code is running inference on one sequence, so our `batch_size`
    is one, but you can experiment with larger numbers if you want to generate multiple
    sequences at once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After we’ve tokenized our input, we create the Transformer model using the `make_model`
    function, which we’ll discuss later in detail. You might think that invoking the
    model would return several tokens as output, since this is the typical text generation
    scenario. However, the Transformer is only able to generate a single token each
    time it’s called. Since we want to generate many tokens, we use a `for` loop to
    call it multiple times, and in each iteration we append the newly generated token
    to the original sequence of tokens using `torch.cat`.

    example, `gpt-35-turbo` (Chat GPT) has a limit of 4096 tokens, and `gpt-4-32k`
    has a limit of 32768 tokens. Since we pass to the Transformer model the concatenation
    of the input tokens and all output tokens generated so far, the token limit of
    the model refers to the total number of input plus output tokens. In our code,
    we define this token limit using the `block_size` constant, and deal with longer
    sequences of tokens by simply truncating them to the maximum supported length
    in the `limit_sequence_length` function.'

    `model.decode` followed by `model.generator`, which correspond to the two major
    sections of the Transformer architecture. The decoding section expects a mask,
    which we create using the `subsequent_mask` function. We’ll analyze all of these
    functions in detail later in this article. The generation phase returns a sequence
    of probability distributions, and we select the last one (we’ll see why later),
    which we use to predict the next token. This distribution contain a probability
    value for each possible token, representing how likely it is for that token to
    come next in the sentence.

    highest probability in the output distribution (using `torch.argmax`). In actual
    GPT models, the next token is chosen by sampling from the probability distribution,
    which introduces some variability in the output that makes the text feel more
    natural. If you have access to the “Completions playground” in the Azure AI Studio,
    you may have noticed the “Temperature” and “Top probabilities” sliders, which
    give you some control over how this sampling is done.

    of tokens, and has shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`. The Embedding layer takes each
    token, which is a single number, calculates its embedding, which is a sequence
    of numbers of length `d_model`, and returns a tensor containing each embedding
    in place of the corresponding original token. Therefore, the output of this layer
    has shape `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)`.

- en: The purpose of using an embedding instead of the original token is to ensure
    that we have a similar mathematical vector representation for tokens that are
    semantically similar. For example, let’s consider the words “she” and “her”. These
    words are semantically similar, in the sense that they both refer to a woman or
    girl, but the corresponding tokens can be completely different (for example, when
    using OpenAI’s `tiktoken` tokenizer, “she” corresponds to token 7091, and “her”
    corresponds to token 372). The embeddings for these two tokens will start out
    being very different from one another as well, because the weights of the embedding
    layer are initialized randomly and learned during training. But if the two words
    frequently appear nearby in the training data, eventually the embedding representations
    will converge to be similar.

    relative distance of each token in the sequence. Unlike recurrent neural networks
    (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformers don’t inherently
    possess any notion of where in the sequence each token appears. Therefore, to
    capture the order of tokens in the sequence, Transformers rely on a Positional
    Encoding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways to encode the positions of tokens. For example, we could
    implement the Positional Encoding layer by using another embedding module (similar
    to the previous layer), if we pass the position of each token rather than the
    value of each token as input. Once again, we would start with the weights in this
    embedding chosen randomly. Then during the training phase, the weights would learn
    to capture the position of each token.

    inference we want to take into account the full input sequence “A long time ago”,
    so we only care about the last row in this diagram. We pay most attention to “ago”,
    we pay a little less attention to “long”, we pay the least attention to the other
    two tokens, and we produce a next-token prediction of “in”.'

    results back together, we have an output tensor of dimension `(batch_size, seq_len,
    d_model)`. This tensor contains the token predictions for each sub-sequence, and
    is almost ready to be returned to the user. But before we do that, we need one
    last step to finalize its shape and contents.

    from the internal-only `d_model` embedding dimension to the `vocab_size` dimension,
    which is understood by the code that calls our Transformer. The result is a tensor
    dimension of `(batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)`. The purpose of the softmax is
    to convert the values in the third tensor dimension into a probability distribution.
    This tensor of probability distributions is what we return to the user.

    that the input to the Transformer consists of batches of sequences of tokens,
    of shape `(batch_size, seq_len)`. And now we know that the output of the Transformer
    consists of batches of sequences of probability distributions, of shape `(batch_size,
    seq_len, vocab_size)`. Each batch contains a distribution that predicts the token
    that follows the first input token, another distribution that predicts the token
    that follows the first and second input tokens, and so on. The very last probability
    distribution of each batch enables us to predict the token that follows the whole
    input sequence, which is what we care about when doing inference.

    training any other neural network — except that in our scenario, for each input
    sequence of tokens, we expect the output to be the sequence that begins one position
    to the right. For example, if we give it “A long time ago” as input, we expect
    the sampling of the probabilities returned by the model to produce “long time
    ago in”.

    on your own, you can reuse any code you’ve written in the past and adapt it to
    our scenario. If you need guidance, I recommend that you follow the code and explanations
    in [Part 2 of the Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/#part-2-model-training).
    Either way, you’ll need access to a fast GPU, locally or in the cloud. I’m partial

- en: The full Transformer has an encoder section (on the left) and a decoder section
    (on the right). The original intent of the paper was to present an architecture
    for machine translation. In that context, the encoder was used to process the
    input language, and the decoder was used to produce the output language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that in addition to the masked multi-headed self-attention used
    in the GPT-style Transformer, the full Transformer has two other multi-headed
    attention blocks. The one in the encoder is not masked, which means that the `p_attn`
    tensor we saw in the attention section doesn’t have the values in its upper-triangular
    section zeroed out. That’s because in machine translation, generating a single
    output language token may require the model to pay attention to input language
    tokens in all sequence positions, including earlier and later positions. The additional
    multi-headed attention block in the decoder section is a “cross-attention” (as
    opposed to “self-attention”) layer which means that its key and value come from
    a different source than the query, as you can see in the diagram. That’s because
    the model needs to understand how much attention it should pay to each token in
    the input language, as it predicts tokens in the output language. The rest of
    the pieces of the diagram are similar to parts of the GPT-style Transformer, and
    have already been explained in this post.

- en: In this article, we discussed the architecture of a GPT-style Transformer model
    in detail, and covered the architecture of the original Transformer at a high
    level. Given the increasing popularity of GPT models in the industry, and how
    often variations of the original Transformer model come up in recent papers, I
    hope that you’ll find this knowledge useful in your job or education. If you want
    to go deeper, I encourage you to clone the associated [GitHub project](https://github.com/bstollnitz/gpt-transformer)
    and explore the code. Set breakpoints in any section of the code that isn’t clear
    to you, run it, and inspect its variables. If you have access to a GPU, write
    code that trains it and see the performance of its predictions improve.

    demystify some of the misconceptions associated with these models. Many people
    in the general public assume that these models have a higher-level understanding
    of the world, which you now know is not the case. They’re simply composed of mathematical
    and statistical operations aimed at predicting the next token based on previous
    training data. Maybe future versions of generative models will have a better understanding
    of the world, and generate even better predictions? If so, I’ll be here to tell
    you all about it.
