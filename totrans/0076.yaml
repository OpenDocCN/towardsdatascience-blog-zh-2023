    geoscientist or petrophysicist. By learning these skills, we can ensure that we
    can get across our research and analysis results to our intended audience. By
    understanding our audience, we can tweak the charts and the messages accordingly,
    for example, we could have a more simplified and artistic chart for the general
    public but a more complex one for presenting at a conference with our peers.
