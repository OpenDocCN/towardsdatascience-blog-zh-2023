    evidence-based stream of data analytics where professionals are tasked with using
    concepts of data science, implement data models, and visualize data to recommend
    actionable insights. Simply put, People Analytics is the end-to-end data lifecycle
    from extraction to communicating to the business, but on HR data.

    Analytics is associated with what the business can become by the impact the people
    within create on business goals, mission and vision and evaluate the effectiveness
    of human resources initiatives.
