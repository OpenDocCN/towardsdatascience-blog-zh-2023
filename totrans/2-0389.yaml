    jailbreaking of large language models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT and GPT-4\. I’ll
    discuss the ethical guidelines companies are currently using in LLM development
    and the approaches they use to try to safeguard against generation of undesirable
    content. Then I’ll review recent research papers studying toxic content generation,
    jailbreaking, and bias from multiple angles: gender, race, medicine, politics,

- en: Bias refers to prejudice in favor or or against a specific group, person, or
    thing, while toxicity refers to disrespectful, vulgar, rude, or harm-promoting
    content. LLMs are biased and have the capacity to generate toxic content because
    they are trained on vast quantities of Internet data, which unfortunately represents
    both the good and bad sides of humanity, including all of our biases and toxicity.
    Thankfully, developers of LLMs like OpenAI and Google have taken steps to reduce
    the chances of LLMs producing overtly biased or toxic content. However, as we
    will see, that doesn’t mean the models are perfect — in fact, LLMs amplify existing
    biases and maintain the ability to generate toxic content in spite of safeguards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of “jailbreaking” refers to giving an LLM particularly challenging
    or provocative prompts in order to exploit the model’s existing biases and existing
    capacity for toxic content generation, in order to obtain LLM output that violates
    company content policies. Researchers who study jailbreaking do so in order to
    alert companies to LLM vulnerabilities, so that the companies can strengthen the
    safeguards they’ve put in place and make it less likely for the models to be jailbroken
    in the future. Jailbreaking research is similar to [ethical hacking](https://www.avast.com/c-hacker-types),
    in which hackers uncover system weaknesses in order to repair them, resulting
    in improved system security.

    Because there is no national regulation, companies that develop LLMs have independently
    developed their own ethical guidelines, which are a combination of instructions
    to users (i.e., “do not use our LLMs for X, Y, Z”) and descriptions of the kinds
    of behavior the companies are trying to get their LLMs to avoid.

    marketing, scams, plagiarism, academic dishonesty, fake review generation, generation
    of adult content, political lobbying, stalking, leaking personal information,
    offering legal/financial/medical advice, and criminal justice decision making.
    The reason they list all of this out is because the model very much *does* have
    these capabilities buried within its weights, and the only reason these capabilities
    aren’t glaringly obvious is because of the “fine tuning” stage that tries to hide
    them.

    but only a few paragraphs later, the policy says that consumer-facing uses of
    their models in medical industries “must provide a disclaimer to users informing
    them that AI is being used” — thus assuming that people will be building and selling

    less likely, but (b) at the end of the day, profit is alluring, and I’m not convinced
    that the current safeguards are actually stringent enough to prevent misuse of
    the models. More work is needed! Now let’s take an in-depth look at the current
    safeguards.

    stage is called [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback).
    In RLHF, human trainers are used to improve the model’s behavior. TIME magazine
    [recently reported that OpenAI used Kenyan workers getting paid $1.32 to $2 per
    hour to make ChatGPT less toxic](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/).
    The process involved reading and labeling graphic, violent, and sexually explicit
    content. Workers described the process as mentally scarring “torture.” One worker
    suffered from recurring disturbing visions as a result of the content he had to
    read. The fine-tuning stage, including the RLHF, is used to alter the model’s
    weights to make it less likely to produce harmful content.

    was less likely to recommend advanced imaging for Black patients than White patients.
    GPT-4 was also dramatically less likely to recommend a heart stress test and angiography
    to female patients than to male patients. In fact, for the heart testing example,
    GPT-4 was even more biased than human cardiologists, who are already biased! It’s
    been shown that [women are less likely to receive timely and accurate diagnosis
    of cardiovascular disease](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/news/blog/gender-bias-in-the-diagnosis-of-cardiovascular-disorders#:~:text=However%2C%20recent%20studies%20have%20shown,crucial%20for%20improving%20patient%20outcomes.).

    in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in perceptions or the ground

    in our study items, but when explicitly prompted, they recognize the ambiguity;
    (e) LLMs provide explanations for their choices that are factually inaccurate
    and likely obscure the true reason behind their predictions. That is, they provide
    rationalizations of their biased behavior.

    (September 2023), in which researchers developed an algorithm to quantify the

    inputs. A summary of the results is shown in [this figure](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JXezVtrurGHRixgH67ZpEuapgM.jpg)

    a professional context and a fiction/story context, with more dramatic biases
    exemplified in the fiction/story context. The most biased model in a professional
    context was GPT-4, while the most biased model in a fiction/story context was

    Like any tool, they can be used for both good and evil. What’s different about
    LLMs is that they are the first tool available for scalable written content creation.
    Ordinary people and companies can now create massive quantities of written or
    programmatic content with minimal human effort. It’s appropriate that LLM creators
    are working to limit harmful applications of their models. However, there is still
    a long way to go. LLMs not only absorb biases from their training data, they make
    the biases worse. Furthermore, LLMs can be used to threaten, misinform, and manipulate
