    grocery chain, or on Amazon, are common examples.

    can then investigate the results, to understand *and better meet* the specific
    needs of your customer segments. You especially want to figure out what makes
    for a high CLV customer, so you can concentrate your efforts on acquiring *and
    serving* more customers like them. I listed plenty of ideas last time, based only
    on using historic data. Now that we’re talking about prediction, using machine
    learning (ML) algorithms, there are some new possibilities…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Use ‘model insights’ to explore characteristics of high CLV customers.**
    Certain ML algorithms come with ‘explainability’ features. These help data scientists
    understand why the model made the predictions it did. A ‘decision tree’ algorithm,
    for example, learns rules from combinations of its input features: rules like,
    ‘customers who are registered members, aged under 30, living in city A, who made
    their first purchase in-store, will spend an average of $327 in the next three
    months.’ Data scientists and domain experts, such as your marketing team, can
    try to interpret what these rules mean in the real world. Why is city A important?
    Do people of a certain income bracket live there? Or are the stores there just
    better, e.g. with nicer checkouts or a wider product assortment?'

    split up customers based on information about them and their transaction history.
    In the end, there’ll be buckets of customers. The average (mean) CLV per bucket
    will be the prediction for all customers in that bucket. Source: Author provided.'

    prior purchase timelines, what they’ve bought, whether they’ve made lots of returns
    or contacted customer service, and so on. Try to establish whether there’s a poor

    you and the customer.** You could do this by looking for any obvious changes,
    like a change of customer address, a shift in product category purchased, or dramatic
    decreases in purchase quantity, frequency or value. These might indicate a real
    change in the customer’s needs. For example, if they suddenly start buying baby
    items, they probably have new preferences, and a changed budget. Use this knew
    knowledge to intuit whether the relationship is worth saving (given the cost of
    customer acquisition, I’d always assume it’s worth it, unless there’s strong evidence
    otherwise). Then you can try to fix the situation. Last post I mentioned including
    sizing recommendations as an example of improving the product fit. Other options
    could be more targeted, clearer communication, or even providing product recommendations
    (another data science topic, for another blog).'

    the costs of this go deeper than just refunding the original purchase price: think,
    shipping expenses (Cost of Delivery Services), payment fees from PayPal, Mastercard,
    etc (Cost of Payment Services), and wages to the staff who packed and unpacked
    the goods, checked their condition, steam-ironed them, and re-shelved them in
    the warehouse. At some point, their net revenue may even be negative. And if they
    also place heavy demands on your customer service team — for example, if refund
    requests are handled manually in your company — then they’re also detracting from
    the effort you could spend servicing better quality customers. So, **if a customer’s
    CLV prediction is low, and their historic costs are high, you can simply stop
    engaging with them.** I don’t mean ignore their service requests! You can bet
    they’ll spread bad reviews about you to other people then. But remove them from
    email and other marketing lists, and let the relationship fizzle out.'

    may be less likely to leave you for other providers (owing to complicated internal
    purchasing procedures). And if they *do* leave you, they can take significant
    revenues with them. **Ideally your business customers will make themselves known
    to you, but when they don’t, CLV could help you detect them.** If you predict
    an unusually high number or value of future transactions for a specific customer,
    it might be a business. Try to verify this using their purchase history. How do
    the number and kinds of items or services bought compares to the entire customer
    population, any other business customers you *do* know of? You can then reach
    out to them for confirmation. And once you know they’re a business, you can give
    them extra focus, offering things like special shipping conditions, personalised
    service, and relationship management.

    the above use-cases *proactively***. Historic analyses take time, and don’t always
    get priority among busy data science or marketing teams. Unfortunately, that means
    customers can cause the business a lot of costs before anyone notices. Worse still,
    their purchase frequency might drop off significantly, before you get around to
    re-engaging them. This can lead to losing that customer altogether.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, your data science and engineering teams should be monitoring your in-production
    CLV prediction models anyway. This means they can **set up automated alerts to
    fire when there’s a CLV risk**. A simple way to start is to send an alert whenever
    a customer’s predicted CLV drops to below a certain monetary threshold. However,
    this doesn’t take the distribution of typical CLV into account. There are probably
    a small minority spending big every month, and a large but faithful long-tail,
    who spend much less. If you try to create a single “CLV risk threshold”, you could
    end up over-reacting to slight spending fluctuations in the long-tail, and missing
    drop-offs among the big spenders. A more sophisticated approach is to fire an
    alert whenever an individual’s prediction drops by a certain percentage, compared
    to their last prediction. Alerts can be routed to marketing or customer service
    staff, via email or Slack, for example, enabling them to act fast to save the
    relationship.

    might be ready to be nudged along their loyalty journey** towards ambassadorship.
    You can even set up alerts when certain input features to the model change dramatically.*
    Increased cost features could indicate a customer which needs to be ‘fired’, while
    increased units purchased could reveal a new business customer in need of special
    attention.

    of a time-span to be reasonable and reliable. Instead, we usually try to estimate
    the value a customer will generate over a specific future period, such as the
    next three months. **You can thus anticipate revenue inflows, using the predictions
    of your entire customer base.** Of course, this will be even more accurate if
    you have a good understanding of your customer acquisition rate, and some good
    historical analytics on when in their lifetime customers tend to spend (another
    topic from last post). This way, even for new customers, for whom a CLV prediction
    might not yet be very reliable, you can factor in average spending as identified
    in your historic CLV analyses.
