- en: While it feels amazing to get that 90% accuracy on your classification model
    test set, you will need to justify using the model in your business regardless.
    So much of data science education is focused on many things like popular algorithms,
    feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, to name a few. Although those
    are incredibly important parts of data science, there should also be a focus on
    how to incorporate data into your business. Rather than discussing those more
    traditional parts, we will strive for gaining a better understanding of opportunity,
    problem statements, stakeholders, KPIs, and testing.

    you will have to find one yourself. Generally, you are in some space of the company
    already and can use data analytic tools to isolate key areas for the business
    to improve on. It might be the case that data science algorithms are not necessarily
    the answer or full solution.

  prefs: []

- en: A simple way to think about KPIs is metrics that we base a decision on, so really,
    we could just call them decision metrics. There are also secondary metrics that
    are good to track as well but aren’t the basis of our decision and could actually
    decrease in improvement, as long as the main KPIs improve.

    are different*), we can track them with an AB Test for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over time, we will want to track these 3 metrics to see if our solution improves
    the problem or not. Notice how I have not mentioned data science or algorithms
    in a while — this situation could likely happen with your business as the stakeholders
    and others will mainly care about the impact and not the method used, which is
    data science in this case.

    to a lot of businesses whether or not the solution is data science oriented or
    not. However, it is important to be aware of it, as this process is fairly common,
    and can help you apply your data science solution to your company in an efficient
    and helpful way.
