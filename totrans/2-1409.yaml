    AI. The technology itself isn’t new; numerous tech companies have developed and
    launched desktop/web/mobile apps with some “generative” components — Maybe you
    recall having fun with the [SimSimi chatbot](https://simsimi.com/) or have been
    using the [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en&gl=US)

    interest in the technology. The ChatGPT user interface provides easy accessibility
    for usage and the GPT-4 high-quality content-generation capability took the world
    by storm as people started seeing the utilization potential of this technology.

    of a client who hires an artist to create an image with general directions as

    Due to the [**inherent biases**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/beware-of-biases-in-data-analysis-accf0cb9b3a)

    favor a certain culture or demography due to the limitations of training data.
    A model can only generate output based on what it has been trained, and if it’s
    only trained on specific demography data, it will only generate output from that
    demography — eventually might not give a **representative image** for the users.

    human evaluation as part of the AI usage lifecycle is important to ensure explainability
    in the outputs and avoid bias in the decision-making process the AI is part of.
