    always coming up in the data science field — — a new algorithm, a new practice,
    a new concept. How should we data scientists keep current and navigate through
    this ever-changing field? In this article, I would like to share what to learn
    and how to learn continuously as someone who is self-taught in data science and
    currently works in this field.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before discussing how to learn as a data scientist continuously, it's important
    to first understand why. Learning without purpose seldom gives an actual uplift
    in skills since it’s hard to keep you motivated consistently. For me, continuous
    learning is almost a necessity at work. Encountering roadblocks at work is common
    due to the complex nature of the problems. Building something from scratch or
    improving problem-solving methods always requires extra research, reading, and
    practice. Besides, I am also a curious person and eager to learn more about the
    latest trends and cutting-edge technologies in my field. Going through my past
    projects and articles at Medium, some techniques that were cutting-edge back then
    look so outdated today. I am amazed by how fast this field is evolving, and at
    the same time, I feel obligated to evolve and update my skill sets. For me, continuous
    learning increases work efficiency, boosts confidence and job security, and inspires
    me in content creation. In fact, a mindset of continuous learning is beneficial
    for anyone seeking growth and willing to step out of their comfort zone, not just
    limited to data science or the tech industry. Find your ‘why’ before you start.

    necessary to excel in this field. It’s essential to have solid **mathematical
    and theoretical foundations** and stay abreast of the latest **algorithms** and
    best practices in **coding**. From a practical perspective, knowing the math behind
    an algorithm or a technical concept seems to take a lot of time and effort, but
    I still find it beneficial in the long term. On top of these, **problem-solving**
    is another important skill to have, which involves quickly learning, navigating
    ambiguity, summarizing, and generalizing specific tasks for future use. These
    skills will equip you to generate useful insights and business value from messiness
    and ambiguity.

    you gain more experience in specific industries. Businesses operate very differently
    across industries. Thus, the way of driving insights can be very different. For
    example, data analysis in healthcare is very different due to the privacy concerns
    of the data and how data are collected and stored. Industries like E-commerce
    or social media may have a lot of data and relatively easier to run experiments
    to get insights, while traditional industries might have more limitations. It's
    important to connect data science with domain knowledge in your industry by understanding
    how the business operates.

    definitely over 40 hours. Once I started working, I realized that working side
    hustles or learning something new requires more effort when juggling a full-time
    job. Therefore, I have learned the importance of scheduling specific time blocks
    on my calendar outside of work hours to focus on these tasks. Otherwise, I may
    find myself working hard one day and don’t what to do the next day. Or mindlessly
    wasting time on the couch without even realizing it. I usually block several weekday
    evenings for working on side projects or taking online courses and mornings for
    reading interesting blog posts. Find the schedule that works the best for you
    to try it out, and then make adjustments accordingly until you find your comfortable

    these concepts through without any ambiguities. When we are reading or attending
    lectures, we take in or ***input*** new information. It is essential to take out

    is knowing the difference between method and methodology. When completing a task,
    we follow a method to get this specific task done. In the meantime, we summarize
    a methodology to get all tasks similar to this one done in the future. For example,
    you are tasked to clean a specific data set before the EDA and modeling process.
    You preprocess this dataset by following methods of filling in missing data, checking
    duplicates, etc. You might need to customize the method due to specific data formats.
    After several similar tasks, you might get a generalizable method for preprocessing
    most datasets, like what [this article has summarized](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/what-does-garbage-in-garbage-out-mean-in-solving-real-business-problems-14962fab43fe).
    Learning through summarizing and reflecting internalizes the task-solving process
    into your skillset. Without this crucial step, you miss out on the most important
    aspect of learning by doing, which extends your ability to solve specific tasks
    to solve a wide range of similar tasks in the future.

    limited energy and attention. AI is a good study pal, consultant, teacher, assistant,
    etc. Use it responsibly and critically. The latest technology offers many advantages
    that we can benefit from. Here are some great medium articles I came across that
    share the amazing tools that we can all leverage to learn and practice data science
    better:'

    or study vlogs. Watching their videos motivates me to get together when I feel
    lazy and unproductive. You can also search for recorded x-hour study-with-me videos
    from different YouTubers. They always have a nice setup with good music and good
    vibes. Sometimes, I open one as my [Pomodoro Timer](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)
    to help me get focused when doing deep work. There are also study/work live streams
    that you can join. It will make you feel like in a classroom or library with good
    communities that hold each other accountable.

    hours sounds scary. Sometimes, it is indeed overwhelming! Burnout is so common
    in the tech industry that you are entitled to give yourself breaks occasionally.
    Know when to say no and when to give yourself a break. You can have vacations
    and plan a resting day of the week that you use to do activities that relax you
    the most. I relax by going to the gym or visiting a bookstore, and I take PTOs
    every quarter to travel somewhere. Knowing how to relax is also a critical skill
    as important as knowing how to be productive.

    need to push ourselves too hard? Recently I read a book called [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357)
    by Tim Ferriss. With all the refreshing points brought up by the book, one I want
    to share in this article is “**avoid distress but embrace eustress**.” Distress
    is bad, it makes people burn out, however, we all need “eustress” in life. Eustress
    is the healthy kind of stress, the one that gives you energy and motivates you
    to be better. Continuous learning provides me the healthy stress, the one that
    doesn’t give me anxiety but fulfillment. Thank you for reading this far. Hope
    this article is useful for you to find your comfortable ways of navigating in
    this ever-change field.
