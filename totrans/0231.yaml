    to install both, TensorFlow as well as its Object Detection API on your machine,
    there are still plenty of problems you will likely face (this is especially true,
    if you are aiming at an installation with GPU support). This post will not make
    any assumptions and guide you right through the whole process to get you up to
    speed.

    vision tasks are feasible on an average new computer, I highly recommend using
    a machine with an NVIDIA GPU (graphics card) installed. As a side note, AMD graphics
    cards are usually not supported by neither TensorFlow nor PyTorch.'

    GPU, you can 1) train your models and 2) infer a prediction very quickly. If you
    run a CPU-only set-up, I do advise you NOT TO (re)train a model, but rather only
    install a model and make predictions through that pre-trained model.
