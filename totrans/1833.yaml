- en: As I began writing this article on September 30th of last year, another month
    came to an end, but this is no ordinary month. For many Mexicans, it represents
    an ongoing concern, as it is well-remembered that this particular month has often
    witnessed our country being shaken by earthquakes, often of significant intensity.
    This article aims to provide readers with valuable insights into the seismic history
    of Mexico through data analysis and visualization. While it doesn’t make predictions
    or formulate policies, it offers a deeper understanding of seismic trends and
    patterns. By gaining this knowledge, readers can be better prepared for seismic
    events and contribute to informed decision-making regarding construction and disaster
    preparedness.

    19th**. On this date in 1985, Mexico experienced the most devastating earthquake
    on record, with a magnitude of 8.1 on the Richter scale. Approximately 40,000
    people lost their lives, and nearly 4,000 were rescued from the rubble of countless
    buildings and houses that crumbled due to the tectonic movement.'

    on September 19th by a 7.1 magnitude Richter scale earthquake, reopening the wounds
    of 1985 for many who lived through that catastrophe. It wasn’t until 2017 that
    I understood why my parents get so nervous at the first sound of the seismic alert
    installed in Mexico City, which allows us to anticipate what’s coming a few seconds
    in advance at least. Before 2017, I didn’t take the alarm’s sound seriously, but
    experiencing an earthquake on the ninth floor (where I used to work), from where
    you can see the dust clouds of nearby buildings collapsing, hear the unified screams
    of terrified people while the building creaks as if it’s about to break, and the
    movements throw you to the ground, marks you for life.

    day. During the earthquake, my girlfriend, now the mother of our beautiful little
    one, and I, stayed embraced, forgetting the disagreement we had that morning.
    Since then, hearing the sound of the seismic alert sends shivers down my spine,
    just like it does to many of us who currently inhabit Mexico City.

    1 p.m., we were once again surprised by seismic alerts sounding throughout the
    city, forewarning us of what was coming: a 7.7 magnitude Richter scale earthquake.
    Despite the construction of stronger and more imposing houses and buildings to
    prevent such events, there is never a guarantee of immunity from the forces of
    nature. On this occasion, at least two people were reported dead, and more than
    3,000 properties were affected. This led many to ask: Is there something special
    about this date? Why do strong earthquakes occur in Mexico on this particular
    day? Could it be a punishment from the Aztec gods demanding a sacrifice?'

    you’re using is licensed for commercial use. Fortunately, a highly reliable source
    that I recommend is the National Seismological Service (SSN). The SSN maintains
    a seismic monitoring network throughout the country and provides data with a suitable
    license for commercial purposes. Their dataset spans from 1900 to the present
    day and is updated almost immediately with records of new seismic events.

    through data analysis and visualization. While it doesn’t offer predictions or
    policy recommendations, it equips readers with a valuable understanding of seismic
    trends. This knowledge can have a significant impact on personal safety, urban
    planning, and construction practices. By being aware of when and where seismic
    activity is most likely, individuals and communities can make informed decisions
    to mitigate risks. Whether you’re a resident of Mexico City or an engineer designing
    earthquake-resistant structures, the insights gained from this analysis can make
    a real difference. Stay safe, stay informed, and remember that knowledge is a
