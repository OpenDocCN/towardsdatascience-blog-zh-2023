    Italy, there have been abnormally high temperatures, droughts, catastrophic floods
    in Emilia Romagna, fires and other events that are all consequences of global
    warming.

    to be aware of this situation by analyzing Climate change data. Like we were monitoring
    and making predictions with covid data a few years ago, we also should do the
    same with climate-related data.

    you may be lost and forget what was your initial purpose. For this reason, I decided
    to list the best sources, some of them not so known, to encourage the analysis
    of these catastrophic events, that could be useful for monitoring and managing
    the affected areas from climate change. Let’s get started!

    production is over 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions nowadays. In addition
    to this, there are more than 1 billion tons of food lost and wasted every year.

    strategies for better management of water resources.
