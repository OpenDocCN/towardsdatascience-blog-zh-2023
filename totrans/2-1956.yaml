- en: Nowadays, companies use data from different sources to solve their business
    problems. Being able to efficiently collect and combine those data has become
    an essential skill for all Data Scientists and Data Engineers in order to assist
    organizations with smart decision-making.

- en: In this tutorial, we will first build your understanding of a powerful data
    combination approach called Data Blending before exploring the benefits. Then
    we will explore some of its drawbacks and finally cover some of the top questions
    related to Data Blending using Tableau.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as Excel Spreadsheet, SQL, CSV, etc. As Data Scientist, you will need to
    interconnect them in order to generate global business insights.

    blending, and relationships.'

    two approaches.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If you have been working with SQL before, you might be familiar with the main
    joins concepts: left, right, inner, cross, and full outer joins. The same applies
    when using Tableau.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These Joins aim to combine different tables from the same source, based on some
    logical column relationships between those tables. For instance, trying to combine
    an Excel file and a SQL table will break because they do not come from the same
    source.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, when joining tables, the columns used in the two tables must be the same
    and changing these data type lead the join to break.

    sources such as databases, business intelligence systems, cloud systems, flat
    files, web services, etc. to create a single data for better visualizations.

    drag-and-drop interface for analytics and visualization. The non-technical aspect
    makes it stand out in the industry.
  prefs: []

    multiple sources such as spreadsheets, SQL databases, web services, etc. whether
    from the cloud or on-premise.

    the first two columns' names are different (Period, Capitals for Department 1,
    and Year, Cities for Department 2).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    columns involved in the Join need to be the same. We will see how Data Blending
    can smartly combine those data without any prior column normalization.

  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for that is that we havenâ€™t specified to Tableau that the Capitals
    column has the same level of information as the Cities column, which leads to
    having the star signs for the Cities column in the visualization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where Data Blending comes in handy by fixing such an issue, which can
    be done by specifying that the Cities and Capitals columns mean the same thing.
    Below is the illustration.

    Period and Year columns, otherwise, we will face the same issue as the one before.

    a lot of benefits compared to Joins. Some of them are shown below:'
  prefs: []

- en: '**No preprocessing of data columns**'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We donâ€™t need to perform any costly preprocessing of columns to be able to combine
    different data with Data Blending, because a simple specification of the columns
    of interest is enough for the Data Blending algorithm to understand how to efficiently
    combine the data.

- en: '**2\. A better way to solve the granularity issue**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Blending provides better flexibility when it comes to combining data with
    different levels of granularity. Letâ€™s imagine that our departments' revenue data
    were organized at a monthly level instead of yearly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using simple joins will lead to an inaccurate result because the yearly rows
    will be duplicated for each monthly row as illustrated below. Data Blending can
    solve this issue by aggregating the months' information to the yearly level.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Letâ€™s consider the previous granularity case. Without Data Blending, we would
    have to perform some data preprocessing such as aggregations, and duplicate removal.
    When dealing with huge data sets, this kind of preprocessing can quickly become
    time-consuming.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accurate decision-making relies on having a better overview of the data. It
    took a few clicks and drag and drop to capture the essence of the two departments.
    Using Joins could lead to inaccurate results, thus inaccurate decision-making.

    below:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Blending works with the left join under the hood, and it does not perform
    any other types of joins.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The order matters when trying to blend data with different granularity. The
    secondary data always have to have the smallest level of granularity, because
    it is the one that is subject to aggregation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    blending.
