- en: In the tumultuous year of 1945, as the world was gripped by what would be the
    final throes of World War II, a game of solitaire quietly sparked an advancement
    in the realm of computation. This was no ordinary game, mind you, but one that
    would lead to the birth of the Monte Carlo method([1](https://library.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00326866.pdf)).
    The player? None other than scientist Stanislaw Ulam, who was also deeply engrossed
    in the Manhattan Project([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924739/)).
    Ulam, while convalescing from an illness, found himself engrossed in solitaire.
    The complex probabilities of the game intrigued him, and he realized that simulating
    the game repeatedly could provide a good approximation of these probabilities([3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/monte-carlo-simulation)).
    It was a lightbulb moment, akin to Newton’s apple, but with playing cards instead
    of fruit. Ulam then discussed these ideas with his colleague John von Neumann,
    and together they formalized the Monte Carlo method, named after the famed Monte
    Carlo Casino in Monaco, (portrayed in Edvard Munch’s famous painting shown above),
    where the stakes are high and chance rules — much like the method itself.

    Its robustness and versatility have ensured its continued relevance, more than
    seven decades after its inception. From Ulam’s solitaire games to the sophisticated
    AI applications of today, the Monte Carlo method remains a testament to the power
    of simulation and approximation in tackling complex systems.

    randomly at a large square dartboard. Inside this square, there’s a circular target.
    Your goal is to estimate the value of pi, the ratio of the circle’s circumference
    to its diameter.

    should be approximately pi/4\. Multiply this ratio by 4, and you have an estimate

    higher than 2 and lower than 4\. As you can see from the resulting figures, the
    size of the circle varies widely depending on the guess, demonstrating the inaccuracy
    of this approach (which shouldn’t come as a surprise). The green circle in each

    this estimated circle and the unit circle gives an indication of the accuracy
    of the Monte Carlo estimate.

    the number of “darts” increases, the estimated circle should converge towards
    the unit circle as more “darts” are thrown. Therefore, while both methods show
    a gap when the estimate is inaccurate, this gap should decrease more consistently
    with the Monte Carlo method as the number of “darts” increases.

    of all possible combinations in the hyperparameter space on the training set,
    and selecting the combination that yields the best average performance according
    to a predefined metric (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc.). This involves splitting
    the training data into several subsets (or “folds”, which we’ve set to 5 in our
    code), training the model on some of the folds and evaluating it on the remaining
    fold, and then averaging the performance across all the folds. This is known as
    cross-validation and helps to reduce overfitting by ensuring that the model performs
    well on average across different subsets of the training data.

    subsets of the training data. It selects hyperparameters randomly, evaluates the
    model on the entire training set, and then selects the hyperparameters that yield
    the best performance on the test set. This approach does not use any cross-validation
    and hence does not average the performance across different subsets of the training
    data.

    selected by the Monte Carlo method, it did not select it as the “best” hyperparameters
    because it likely did not yield the best average performance across the different
    subsets of the training data during the cross-validation process. However, the
    combination selected by the Monte Carlo method happened to yield better performance
    on the specific test set used in this experiment. This suggests that the selected
    hyperparameters perform well on the specific characteristics of the test set,
    even though they did not perform the best on average across different subsets
    of the training data.

    different subsets of the training data in the grid search method, and the variance
    introduced by evaluating the model on the entire training set and selecting the
    hyperparameters based on a single test set in the Monte Carlo method.

    impact the performance. You can also compare the computation time between the
    two methods with different hyperparameter spaces to understand their efficiency.
    This exercise aims to demonstrate the dynamics of these methods, which have their
    merits and limitations, and to highlight that the “best” method may depend on
    your specific scenario, computational resources, and model requirements. So, feel
    free to experiment and happy learning!

    the landscape of computational mathematics and data science. Its power lies in
    its simplicity and versatility, allowing us to tackle complex, high-dimensional
    problems with relative ease. From estimating the value of pi with a game of darts
    to tuning hyperparameters in machine learning models, Monte Carlo simulations
    have proven to be an invaluable tool in our data science arsenal.
