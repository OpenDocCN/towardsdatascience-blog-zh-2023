- en: ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/),
    designed to work as a chatbot assistant, generating human-like conversational
    output (responses) in response to text input (prompts).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although up for [debate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chatgpt-simply-predicting-next-word-trung-ngo-ph-d-)
    in the machine learning community, the easiest way to explain ChatGPT is to say
    that it is a statistical model that is *trained to predict the next word in a
    series based on the words it’s seen so far (like predictive search) and based
    on the data it’s been trained on.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the training process, the model is fed a massive amount of text data.
    The model learns the underlying structure of the training data by studying the
    intricate patterns, relationships, and dependencies between different texts. This
    means that when you receive a response from ChatGPT, it’s not pulling specific
    information from a defined source. Instead, it’s making an educated prediction
    based on the input you’ve provided and the data it was trained on. The response
    you receive is an approximation, designed to mirror what the information might
    be, rather than a direct retrieval of concrete data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, because the model isn’t hooked up to the internet or any other sort
    of external data source, it can spit out wildly inaccurate information in a very
    convincing way. For example, when I ask ChatGPT to give me the titles of five
    influential papers on the topic of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,
    three of the articles it suggests don’t even exist.‌

    sound totally plausible. They are even attributed to well-known authors in the
    field. This is called [hallucination](/llm-hallucinations-ec831dcd7786) and it’s
    one of the most serious flaws of LLMs. While there are several machine learning
    methods that can reduce hallucination in LLMs, enabling these models to connect
    to data sources through the use of plugins is a lower-cost way to increase accuracy
    and further expand the capabilities of LLMs.

    model with recent, personal, or specific data that was not included in the model’s
    training data. The connection of the LLM to real-time data sources, like databases
    or web browsing, is aimed at helping ChatGPT produce more accurate and timely
    results. It also allows the chatbot to perform more complex tasks, like responding
    to an email, directly within the ChatGPT interface. Let’s break down all this
    added functionality into different categories.

    and search the internet without using a search engine and clicking on links. The
    purpose of this new functionality is to streamline your search process and internet
    browsing experience, cutting out manual tasks like vetting results, clicking on
    links, and scanning those web pages for the desired information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To accomplish this, ChatGPT essentially rephrases your prompt into a search
    query, performs an internet search, clicks on the most relevant link, reads the
    webpage, and responds with your desired information. Let’s look at how ChatGPT
    in Web Browsing mode answers the question *“Who is running for President in the
    US 2024 election?”*‌

    web browsing capabilities enable ChatGPT to provide relevant, timely information
    on events that occurred after the training cutoff for the base model. Browsing

    used to gather information, which allows the user to independently verify parts
    of ChatGPT’s responses.

    technology to complete a task instead of completing it by hand, is nothing new.
    You encounter it whenever you use self-checkout at the grocery store, check-in
    kiosks at the airport, or send your robot vacuum on a mission to clean up the
    kitchen after dinner. Digital task automation uses software to automate routine
    and repetitive tasks, like sending automatic email responses when you’re out of
    the office.'

    effective and personalized automation of common tasks. Here’s what happens when
    we use the [Zapier plugin](https://zapier.com/blog/announcing-zapier-chatgpt-plugin/)
    and ask ChatGPT to write an email to my mom. To complete this task, ChatGPT asks
    Zapier (which is already connected to my Gmail account) to draft an email with
    all the relevant information (topic, recipient, tone) provided in the prompt.
    Zapier completes the task, using the ChatGPT language model to generate all the
    necessary text, and provides a link that allows me to review and send the draft
    directly from my Gmail account.‌

    any number of tasks without having to open a bunch of tabs, click through things
    manually, and compose your own text. Not only does this save time on a case-by-case
    basis, it also delivers valuable results at scale. For instance, if you regularly

    external data sources come with risks of their own. Language models lack human
    judgment when it comes to vetting internet sources, meaning that we need to exercise
    caution and skepticism when we let a chatbot browse the web for us. Similarly,
    users need to be aware of the personal data they are forfeiting to third-party
