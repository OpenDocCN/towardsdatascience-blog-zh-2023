- en: Improving the supply chain is another key step for reducing our ecological footprint.
    In developed countries, there’s often a large surplus of consumer goods such as
    food. This surplus requires significant energy and resources, which often goes
    to waste.

    gas emissions. We can tackle this problem by better understanding how much we
    need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s take food as an example. Each year, we lose about 1.3 billion metric tons
    of food [1]. Of course, this is not all leftovers or related to the supply chain.
    Some of it is lost during production or transportation, for example, due to poor
    refrigeration conditions. Still, better demand forecasting models can make a significant
    impact on reducing overproduction.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After preprocessing a data set, we’re ready to cluster time series. We summarise
    each series into a small set of unordered features. So, we can use any conventional
    algorithm for clustering. A popular choice is K-means.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With K-means, we need to pick the number of clusters we want. Unless we have
    some domain knowledge, there’s no obvious apriori value for this parameter. But,
    we can carry out a data-driven approach to select the number of clusters. We test
    different values and pick the best one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Below, we test K-means with up to 24 clusters. Then, we pick the number of clusters
    that maximizes the silhouette score. This metric quantifies the cohesion of the
    clusters obtained.

    iteratively, leading to a tree-like structure. The library *scipy* provides an

    we can see that most canned items are grouped (orange color). Oranges also cluster
    with pancake/cake mixes. These two often go together in people’s breakfast.
