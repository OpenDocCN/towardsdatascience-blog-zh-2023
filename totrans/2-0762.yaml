- en: Almost every day we discover the launch of a new machine-learning product, service,
    or dataset. It is the age of AI and, yet, rarely do any of these products inform
    on how much confidence the user should have in the results. However, as [research](https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372852)
    shows, good decision-making requires knowledge of when to trust AI and when not.
    Otherwise, it leads to the common situation that users need to try out the model
    frequently to get an understanding of when to trust and when not to trust that
    model and to find out if the offered product is useful for them.

- en: The reason for such a try-and-error principle by the user is that every model
    (doesn’t matter whether it is based on ML or statistics) is built on data and
    its uncertainty. The model’s underlying data does not represent the actual ground
    truth of what the model is supposed to predict. Otherwise, if that ground truth
    would be available, you would not need a model in the first place. Thus, the resulting
    model will only provide an estimate and not a truth value.

    amount of people moving from one country to another. Of course, there exists data
    (like tax reports) that will provide that information but would that data truly
    represent the full population of movements? Is every student, immigrant, or ex-pad
    changing their tax report? No, that is most likely not the case. Hence, even a
    straightforward product such as providing movements is biased towards its underlying
    data sample (for instance publicly available tax reports). It is easy to imagine
    how more sophisticated products can be biased.

  zh: 让我们举一个例子（图1）。假设一个产品为你提供从一个国家到另一个国家迁移的人数。当然，存在一些数据（如税务报告）可以提供这些信息，但这些数据是否真正代表了全部迁移人口？每个学生、移民或前配偶都会更改他们的税务报告吗？不，很可能不是这样。因此，即使是提供迁移信息这样简单的产品也会偏向其底层数据样本（例如公开的税务报告）。更复杂的产品容易出现偏见，这是很容易想象的。
- en: For machine learning, this limitation gets even worse simply because of its
    probabilistic nature, the manifold input, and each input representing only a tiny
    part of the population. Thus, the underlying model will be biased towards the
    majority of cases described in the training data and will diverge from the underlying
    real-world situation without us knowing. Put short, the correctness of machine
    learning and statistical models is uncertain and cannot always be trusted.

  zh: 什么是95%置信区间？
- en: Choosing a 95% confidence interval is a common approach to describe confidence
    due to its ease of interpretation. The confidence interval comes with a lower
    and upper bound of the data (mostly displayed as slim bars on top of the chart).
    The lower and upper bounds basically describe a range or a corridor in which 95%
    of the predictions would fall given the actual (unknown) true value. Hence, a
    large range (compared to the predicted value) would indicate that the user should
    have less confidence in the presented value itself since the underlying real value
    might be way more of.

- en: Let’s take the example from above and define a product that provides the amount
    of moves from Canada and the US towards EU countries. As seen in Figure 1, the
    hypothetical model here predicts moves closer to the ground truth for outflows
    from Canada compared to the US. Therefore, it would be beneficial to inform the
    end user about a high confidence in the Canada model compared to a lower confidence
    in the US model.

- en: If we do not provide this information in the form of confidence intervals, the
    intuitive conclusion of that data (blue bars on the right since you would not
    know the gray bars) is that there is an equal amount of outflows between those
    two countries into the EU. However, as soon as we add confidence intervals describing
    how much trust we should put into those numbers the interpretation changes. If
    the confidence intervals would describe 95% confidence, a better interpretation
    is that the real underlying amount of moves might differ substantially from what
    is provided here. It could easily be twice as much and would still be in a range
    of 95% confidence. Hence, the user should not make a business decision for those
    moves on the data presented alone and rather focus on the CA moves or evaluate
    other data sources.

- en: '**When you have a test set evaluation:** Even without ongoing ground truth
    or expert knowledge you are still able to describe confidence intervals using
    your test set evaluation (see Figure 2). Every model that is built requires a
    test set to ensure that the model is successfully predicting the desired outcome
    (see [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/success-in-ml-projects-through-technical-drawings-69dd8d2744a4)
    for more info on model development). That test set will tell you also where your
    model performs well and where not. At least for in-sample categories, it will
    allow you to provide confidence intervals. The disadvantage here is, though, that
    models are prone to drift over time. So it is important to find a way to update
    your confidence intervals.'
