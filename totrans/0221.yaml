    1982\. The author, Dr. Piotr Wozniak, was recognized by Wired magazine as the
    [‚Äúinventor of a technique to turn people into geniuses‚Äù](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/)
    in 2008.

    down the material into chunks using flashcards (yes, I understand this is a big
    problem but **bear with me till the end**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After making a database of cards, you start to review them in sessions. The
    first session shows the cards in the order they were added or shuffled (based
    on your preferences). Then, you rate the cards on how well you recall them.

- en: Then, the chosen rating is plugged into long calculations that involve the number
    of times the card was successfully recalled before, the easiness factor of the
    card (don‚Äôt ask), and the inter-repetition interval. The final result will determine
    when the card must be shown again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For cards rated below 4, SuperMemo will ask you to review the card as many times
    as you need during the current session until the rating goes above 4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each correctly recalled card will be shown after increasingly long intervals.
    For example, if you memorize that the function to convert a timestamp into a datetime
    is `datatime.datetime.fromtimestamp`, you only have to review the card showing
    this information 4‚Äì5 times over the span of a month to remember it for the coming
    six months.
