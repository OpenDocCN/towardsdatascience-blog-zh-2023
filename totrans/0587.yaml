    The role of a data scientist is to solve complex problems and drive informed decision-making.
    Fundamental is knowledge about statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms,
    and data visualization. But when it comes to creating products, it also requires
    deep knowledge of engineering together with data governance, ethics, and privacy
    among others. The know-how needed as a data scientist depends on the exact role
    description, and business, among others. Nowadays there are many new roles, from
    *Data Engineer, ML Engineer, Product Data Analyst, Research Scientist, Cloud Data
    Engineer etc*. Each role in its turn also changes with experience level. Entry-level
    positions typically involve working under the guidance of senior data scientists,
    assisting with data preprocessing, and contributing to model development. As you
    progress, mid-level roles require a deeper understanding of statistical analysis,
    feature engineering, and algorithm selection. Senior data scientists often lead
    projects, mentor junior team members, and contribute to strategic planning.

    role in data science opportunities and compensation. Tech hubs like Silicon Valley,
    New York City, and San Francisco offer high-paying positions. However, in the
    last years, it has become technically easier, and more accepted to work from different
    locations worldwide. ***Let’s see whether we can confirm some of these trends

    and categorical variables. We will perform an unsupervised analysis and create
    the data science landscape. But before doing any preprocessing, we need to remove
    redundant features such as `salary_currency`and `salary`to prevent multicollinearity
    issues. In addition, we will exclude the variable `salary_in_usd` from the data
    set and store it as a target variable `y` because we do not want that grouping
    occurs because of the salary itself. Based on the clustering, we can investigate
    whether any of the detected groupings can be related to salary. The cleaned data
    set results in 8 features with the same 4134 samples.

    In order to do this, we will carefully perform one-hot encoding and take care
    of multicollinearity that we unknowingly can introduce. *In other words, when
    we transform any categorical variable into multiple one-hot variables, we introduce
    a bias that allows us to perfectly predict a feature based on two or more features
    from the same categorical column (aka the sum of one-hot encode features is always
    one). This is called a dummy trap and we can prevent it by breaking the chain
    of linearity by simply dropping one column.* The `df2onehot` package contains
    the dummy trap protection feature. This feature is slightly more advanced than
    simply dropping a one-hot column pér category because it only removes a one-hot
    column if the chain of linearity is not yet broken due to other cleaning actions,
    such as a minimum number of samples pér one-hot feature or the removal of the
    `False` state in boolean features.

    5 samples (`y_min=5`), and remove multicollinearity to prevent the dummy trap
    (`remove_multicollinearity=True`). This results in 115 one-hot encoded features
    for the same 4134 samples.

    analysis. Read [this](/what-are-pca-loadings-and-biplots-9a7897f2e559) blog for
    more details. The results of the sample relationships with the loadings of the
    features are shown in the biplot (Figure 2). Take the time to understand it, it
    contains a lot of information. First of all, each point in this 2D space is one
    of the 4134 samples and the distance between two points describes their similarity
    based on the 115 features. The closer the two points are, the more similar the
    points are in some way. In the background of the plot is shown a density map with
    a red glow. High and low-dense areas are stressed in such a manner. The size of
    each point is the salary, a higher salary is related to larger sizes. The color
    is based on `job_title`, and the marker is set to `experience_level`.

    18.9% of the explained variance and the 2nd principal component 14.7%. This indicates
    that the first two components capture a large chunk of the explained variance
    in the data which makes it worthwhile for further interpretation of the sample
    relationships and the loadings. The loadings (black arrows) describe which of
    the original features was responsible for the variance in the principal components.
    The largest loading is from the category `work_year` that separates the data into
    two cigar-like shapes (left bottom towards the top right), whereas `experience
    level` and `company size` creates the long tail of samples towards the top right
    corner.
  prefs: []

    (left bottom). Many of the samples in the left bottom corner have a rectangular
    shape which depicts *seniority experience level*. The more we move towards the
    tail in the right top, the smaller the dots become (relatively less salary) and
    contain mixed shapes, meaning various experience levels. For visual investigation,
    we can apply different colors as shown in Figure 3\. Overall, we can see that
    samples cluster per year and are cigar-like-shaped. Over the years, patterns of
    experience level, company size, and remote work are seen.

    (t-SNE). In the preprocessing step, the `work_year` column is removed to avoid
    any separation on years (the patterns across the years were very similar). After
    the t-SNE embedding, we can scatter the data points in the 2D space using the
    `scatterd` library. This library highlights the dense areas (`density=True`),
    and provides transparency towards less dense areas (`gradient=opaque`), which
    keeps the scatter plot tidy. The landscape can now be found in Figure 5\. Just
