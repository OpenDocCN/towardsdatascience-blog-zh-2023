- en: In the fascinating and rapidly advancing realm of artificial intelligence, one
    of the most exciting advances has been the development of AI text generation.
    AI models, like [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps), [Bloom](https://bloomai.co/),
    [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html),
    [AlexaTM](https://www.amazon.science/publications/alexatm-20b-few-shot-learning-using-a-large-scale-multilingual-seq2seq-model),
    and other large language models, can produce remarkably human-like text. This
    is both exciting and concerning at the same time. Such technological advances
    allow us to be creative in ways we didn’t before. Still, they also open the door
    to deception. And the better these models get, the more challenging it will be
    to distinguish between a human-written text and an AI-generated text.

    over the globe have been testing the limits of such AI models and using them to
    both gain knowledge, but also, in the case of some students, to solve homework
    and exams, which challenges the ethical implications of such technology. Especially
    as these models have become sophisticated enough to mimic human writing styles
    and maintain context over multiple passages, they still need to be fixed, even
    if their errors are minor.

    we call this “deep fake text detection.” Today, there are different tools that
    you can use to detect if a text is human-written or AI-generated, such as GPT-2
    by OpenAI. But how do such tools work?

    determine patterns. For example, among the three N-gram examples we just went
    through, the first is the most common, and the third is the least common. By tracking
    the different N-grams, we can decide that they are more or less common in AI-generated
    text than in human-written text. For instance, an AI might use specific phrases
    or word combinations more frequently than a human writer. We can find the relation
    between the frequency of N-grams used by AI vs. humans by training our model on
    data generated by humans and AI.

- en: If you look up the word perplexed in the English dictionary, it will be defined
    as surprised or shocked, but, in the context of AI and NLP, in particular, perplexity
    measures how confidently a language model predicts a text. Estimating the perplexity
    of a model is done by quantifying how long a model needs to respond to a new text,
    or in other words, how “surprised” the model is by the new text. For example,
    an AI-generated text might lower the perplexity of a model; the better the model
    predicts the text. Perplexity is fast to calculate, which gives it an advantage
    over other approaches.

    burstiness as the phenomenon where certain words appear in “bursts” within a document
    or a set of documents. The idea is that when a word is used once in a document,
    it’s likely to be used again in the same document. AI-generated texts exhibit
    different patterns of burstiness than that written by a human, as they don’t have
    the required cognitive processes to choose other synonyms.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stylometry is the study of linguistic style, and it can be used to identify
    authors or, in this case, the source of a text (human vs. AI). Everyone uses language.
    Differently some prefer short sentences, and some prefer long, connected ones.
    People use semi-colons and em0dashes (And other unique punctuations) differently
    from one person to another. Moreover, some people use the passive voice more than
    the active one or use more complex vocabulary. An AI-generated text might exhibit
    different stylistic features, even writing about the same topic more than once.
    And since an AI doesn’t have a style, these different styles can be used to detect
    if an AI writes a text.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following up on Stylometry, since AI models don’t have their own style, the
    text they generate sometimes needs more consistency and long-term coherence. For
    example, AI might contradict itself or change topics and style abruptly in the
    middle of the text, leading to a more difficult-to-follow flow of ideas.

- en: As we advance into AI, we will need more advanced and complex tools to detect
    AI-generated text to avoid misinformation and deception. Although this is a very
    active area of research today, researchers have developed tools to detect AI-written
    text, an example of such work is done by [Edward Tian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-tian/?originalSubdomain=ca)
    from Princeton University. Tian developed an experimental tool called [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)
    that uses “perplexity” and “burstiness” to estimate the likelihood that an AI-generated
    a piece of content. Another example is [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/),
    a professor and NLP researcher at the University of Washington whose research
    focuses on the unique quality of human-written text intentionality. AI often generates
    text that needs to be more intentional and consistent, which may change as these
    language models improve. None of the approaches explored in this article is bulletproof;
    a combination of different techniques and an extensive training set is often used
    to build real-life AI-generated text classifiers.

    However, these obstacles are never a reason to abandon using new technologies
    but rather an opportunity to develop protocols and rules that allow us to take
    advantage of such great technology ethically.
