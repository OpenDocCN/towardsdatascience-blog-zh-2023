    if you’ve Googled “Customer Lifetime Value”, you’ve been disappointed. I felt
    that too, back when I was helping lead a new CLV research project in a data science
    team in the e-commerce domain. We went looking for state-of-the-art methods, but
    Google returned only basic tutorials with unrealistically manicured datasets,
    and marketing ‘fluff’ posts describing vague and unimaginative uses for CLV. There
    was nothing about the pros and cons of available methods when applied to real
    world data, and with real world clients. We learned all that on our own, and now
    I want to share it.

- en: 'Customer Lifetime Value is the value generated by a customer over their ‘lifetime’
    with a retailer: that is, between their first and last purchase there. ‘Value’
    can be defined as pure revenue: how much the customer spent. But in my e-commerce
    experience, I found that more mature retailers care less about short-term revenue
    than they do about long-term profit. Hence, they’re more likely to consider ‘value’
    as revenue *minus costs*. As we’ll see in part three though, knowing which costs
    to subtract is easier said than done…'

    purchasing (that is, inventory management) teams. In fact, depending on the company’s
    data literacy level and available resources, this might even be enough (at least
    to get started). Plus, data scientists can get a feel for the company’s customers’
    typical spending habits, and this can be invaluable if the company doeslater want
    to *predict* future CLV, on a *per customer* basis.

    future predictions, let’s view some use-cases for each. After all, you want the
    marketing, management, and data science teams to be aligned *from the beginning*
    on how the project’s outputs are going to be used. That’s the best way to avoid
    building the wrong thing, and having to start again later.

    the Top 10% of Spenders, the Middle 20%, and the Bottom 70%. Perhaps you’ve even
    done this multiple times on different subgroups of your customer base, such as

    You could split by membership level, if you offer it. Using tracking cookies from
    your webstore, you can even split by preferred shopping device: desktop computer
    versus tablet versus mobile. Why? Well, maybe your mobile-phone-based shoppers
    have lower basket values, because people prefer to make big purchases on a desktop.

    products follow you around the internet. Those are -called ‘programmatic ads’,

    their acquisition cost. What’s the average, and which CLV tiers and customer demographic
    groups pay themselves off fastest? Knowing this will help marketing teams budget
