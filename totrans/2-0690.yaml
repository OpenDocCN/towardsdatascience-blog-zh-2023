- en: The Manhattan Project was one of the largest scientific collaborations ever
    undertaken. It operated thanks to a complex social network of extraordinary minds
    and it became undoubtedly one of the most remarkable intellectual efforts of human
    history. It also had devastating consequences during and after the atomic bombings
    of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite the loss of hundreds of thousands of human
    lives during the bombing and the subsequent events, the scientific journey itself
    stands as a testament to human achievement, as highlighted in Christopher Nolan’s
    film portrayal of Oppenheimer.

    connections in achieving success, is robust and has been further enriched by the
    current data boom. This wealth of data, represented by for instance millions of
    scientific papers, is exemplified in works such as “The Science of Science,” by
    D. Wang and A. L. Barabási [1]. Utilizing network analysis to uncover the intricate
    connections within the Manhattan Project aligns with my perspective as a physicist
    turned network scientist. Without further ado, here’s how I mapped the Manhattan
    Project into data and used that to create a network visualization of this historically
    significant collaborative project.

    selection. While scientific publication data might seem logical, given the project’s
    scientific nature, this approach proved inadequate. The main reason for this was
    two-fold: First, some of the most important documents and papers could still be
    classified; and also, not everyone was active in science, as the operation was
    also heavily intertwined with politics and the military. Thus, resorting to collective
    wisdom, my focus shifted to Wikipedia, a global crowdsourced encyclopedia and
    a potential data source. Wikipedia offers a list of notable personnel connected
    to the project [2], encompassing more than 400 contributors from various fields.
    I used a straightforward web-scraping technique to collect data from Wikipedia
    — a total of 452 usable profiles. Then I manually categorized each person based
    on occupation, leading to the distribution outlined in the following table.'

    and engineers. However, exploring the realm of science, particularly those at
    the forefront of the Project, awaits. Let’s take the stories from the “Other”
    category. This group collects contributors’ primary occupations that appeared
    infrequently and seemed unrelated to a scientific project focused on weaponry
    development. Among these unconventional contributors are Wolfrid Rudyerd Boulton,
    an American ornithologist, who also happened to become responsible for monitoring
    the supply of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo, and Edith Warner, a tea room
    owner in Los Alamos whose role was said to have profoundly impacted researchers’
    morale.

    librarian, and the sole female laboratory group leader in Los Alamos. Ben Porter
    defies categorization, too, embracing roles as an artist, writer, publisher, performer,
    and physicist — later exhibiting work at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. The
    selection concludes with James Edward Westcott, a notable Manhattan Project photographer,
    and Donald Lindley Harvey, a professional basketball player turned Army member
    contributing to the project.

    that is perfect for elegantly deciphering complex structures such as the Manhattan
    Project’s collaboration patterns. Each network comprises nodes (entities) and
    links (references) that weave the intricate social fabric of the collaborating
    people. In this context, each node symbolizes a Manhattan Project contributor,
    with links forming between individuals whose Wikipedia pages reference one another.
    The number of shared references determines the link’s strength. Employing this
    straightforward framework, I arrived at a network of 316 individuals connected
    by 1,099 ties of various strengths.

    hue representing a distinct network community or cluster. Defining these communities
    hinges on the methodology, but the general premise remains: Communities consist
    of nodes with a higher density of internal links than external ones [4, 5]. In
    other words, nodes mostly linked to each other — as opposed to the rest of the
    network — belong to one community. The resulting visual, presented in Fig. 2,
    uncovers how contributors organize into closely connected clusters within the
    expansive Manhattan Project. In this Figure, each color encodes different communities.'

    network. Key players in modern physics pop out immediately, including Nobel laureates
    Arthur Compton, Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, and Ernest Lawrence, alongside geniuses
    like J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller. Yet, there is much more to the story
    and the patterns behind the connections than just a handful of hubs.

    Niels Bohr. Here, Bohr’s connections reveal his instrumental role in supporting
    refugee scientists during World War II, who also joined the Project, including
    people like Felix Bloch, James Franck, and George Placzek, all marked by red.
    Adjacent to Bohr’s realm resides a green cluster, highlighted by the Italian physicist
    Enrico Fermi. Fermi, together with his collaborators like Anderson, Szilárd, Compton,
    and Zinn, reached the milestone of the self-sustaining chain reaction using uranium
    and gave birth to the first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1.

    his links tie him closer to the purple community that seems to be scattered around
    the network. Wigner can be seen prominently in the upper-right corner of the network.
    This more decentralized community, having no one else but Oppenheimer as its key
    figure, also links the famous Mathematician John von Neumann, with purple, in
    the top-center part of Figure 3, who. (He, along with Wigner was unfortunately
    left out of the blockbuster movie by Nolan.) With purple, we see several other
    leading scientists, such as James Chadwick in the bottom-center, who led the British
    team on the Project; Robert Wilson right next to Oppenheimer, who became the head
    of its Cyclotron Group; and the American physicist Robert Serber directly above
    Oppenheimer, who created the code names for all three design projects and the
    bomb, such as “Little Boy” and “Fat Man.” Finally, a few words about the gray
    cluster, which turned out to be the Theoretical Division, with stars like Edward
    Teller in the center, and Nobel laureates Richard Feynman (my personal favorite
    scientist) in the top left, and Hans Bethe in the center.

    between the Hungarian immigrant Martians [6] Teller, Wigner, Szilard, and Neuman
    were hard to spot, despite their foundational role in the dawn of the atomic era
    and countless joint projects. However, once I highlighted them on the network,
    my expectations were quickly confirmed. They are all closely linked though not
    exclusively, meaning that they were also very well embedded in the American scientific
    community at that time. This is probably best illustrated by the so-called Einstein
    Szilard letter, written by Szilard who also consulted with Teller and Wigner,
    and which was ultimately signed by and sent to President Roosevelt by Einstein.
    A fun fact about this letter: during those days, Einstein was spending his vacation
    on the beach, so Szilard visited him right there. And as Szilard didn’t own a
    driver’s license, Teller was driving him [7].'

    — distinguished minds across varied disciplines united for a common goal. This
    analysis sheds some light on the complex patterns of collaboration and joint efforts
    that allowed such great minds to connect, work in teams, and succeed at such an
    enormous scale. Additionally, the way I built this network illustrates how network
    science can be applied to nearly any social system, quantitatively capturing the
    invisible relations, and helping to interpret the hidden patterns underneath.
