    I have always loved college sports. Growing up, I lived in a Big Ten/SEC household
    and a Big East (now ACC) town which meant a deluge of college sports filled the
    television screen from the first kick-off in August to the last buzzer beater
    in April. Recently, analytics has come to dominate both sports, but since it is
    football season let’s start there.'

- en: The last two off-seasons in college sports have been abuzz with NIL, transfer
    portal, and conference realignment news. I think the sentiment among most fans
    is captured by Dr. Pepper’s “[Chaos Comes to Fansville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq-Ye91fAm0)”
    commercial. I began to notice that every conversation about conference realignment,
    in particular, was filled with speculation and fueled by gut feeling. There was,
    however, a common faith that some great and powerful college football Oz was crunching
    numbers to decide which team was worth adding to which conference. I still haven’t
    had the opportunity to meet his man behind the curtain, so until then I’d like
    to take a shot at proposing a data-driven conference realignment.

    data we have for each team into a latitude and longitude. This is easy to do in
    Python using the [geopy package](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). First,
    I import the dependencies and load in a csv file with the city and state of each
    team.

    a conference. The south is the center of the college football world. The city

    of over 45,000 while the Sun Belt includes the smallest schools with a median
    enrollment of under 20,000\. The ACC has the lowest enrollment schools of any
    Power 5 conference.

- en: Correlation is a measure of the relationship between two features. Correlation
    can range between -1 and 1 where a correlation of 1 represents perfect positive
    relationship, -1 represents perfect negative relationship, and 0 represents no
    relationship. Correlation should not be confused with causation as the correlation
    is simply a metric of the observed relationship between two features. Pandas once
    again comes equipped with the method to easily calculate correlation between two
    columns.

- en: The correlation matrix shows a perfect positive relationship between each feature
    and itself. We also see high correlation between stadium capacity, fan base size,
    2019 revenue, and the percentage of weeks appearing in the AP top 25 between 2001
    and 2021.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resulting correlation matrix is a great visual for understanding which features
    might relate to one another. For example, the stadium capacity, 2019 revenue,
    fan base size, and historic probability of appearing in the AP top 25 poll are
    all highly correlated. Interestingly, these features are only moderately correlated
    with historic win percentages and barely correlated with bowl win percentages.
    One explanation could be that strength of schedule doesn’t show up in our data,
    and a team that goes 8–4 in a Power 5 conference could be much better than a team
    that goes 8–4 in a Group of 5 conference. Moreover, we can intuit directly that
    correlation does not equate to causation because building a bigger stadium will
    not guarantee a bigger fan base.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another interesting take away is that the years a team has been active does
    not correlate strongly with any metric of success. Of course, a long history on
    the gridiron could lead to perennial pain for a fan base. For example, [Indiana
    University](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2022/10/15/indiana-hoosiers-football-iu-first-division-i-program-with-700-losses-most-history-worst-20-years/69484773007/)
    recently became the first FBS team to hit the historic 700 loss mark.

    the x axis and AP poll success on the y axis. The size of each point on the scatter
    plot represents the estimated size of the fan base. This plot shows that we might
    have success estimating the results of Tony Altimore’s fan base size estimation
    analysis with a regression model. I’ll discuss this more in part 2 of my conference
    realignment blogs.
