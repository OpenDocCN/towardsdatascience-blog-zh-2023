    stakeholder when looking at your analysis before turning around and proceeding
    with business as usual. Sounds familiar? Here comes an analysis template to ensure
    that your analyses land actionable results that your stakeholders will want to
    act upon.

    data, bringing it into shape and extracting useful information before finally
    summarizing everything into a presentable format can take up to several weeks.
    The more work one puts into an analysis, the more frustrating it can be if the
    analysis does not lead to any business decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For an analysis to be impactful, it does not only have to land in time so the
    decision at hand is not already made, but it has to include tangible, actionable
    insights with clear next steps and options that are easy for stakeholders to evaluate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actionable insights do not only provide a specific data point that might be
    interesting, but lay out a clear narrative how this insight is connected to the
    problem at hand, what the ramifications are, as well as possible options and next
    steps to take with the associated benefits/risks of (not) acting upon these.

    increasing Conversion Rate, Average Order Value or similar. However this is not
    necessarily a must. Instead one can also focus on a metric or problem where there’s
    a strong hypothesis (or even better evidence) that these are highly connected
    to business outcomes.

    we increase daily listening time for premium users in the Spotify App?* with the

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Opportunity areas are usually identified with deep, descriptive analyses. In
    this case, it could e.g. be helpful to look into and learn from behaviors of users
    who have a high daily listening time, so that we can encourage other users to
    behave in the same way. Findings could for example range from *Users who use auto-generated
    playlists have a x% higher daily listening time*, or *Users who subscribed to
    at least 3 podcasts have a x% higher listening time per day than those who did
    not subscribe to any*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coming back to the example of audiobooks, another piece of insight could be
    that users who use audiobooks spend significantly more time in the app. All of
    these are opportunity areas we could tap into to encourage other users to behave
    in a similar way with the goal to increase retention.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For every opportunity area, we usually have a number of different levers to
    pull to work on this particular area. The goal of each lever is to move the needle
    for the opportunity area at hand, so we can validate whether work on this area
    actually leads to positive outcome for the main problem.

    representing a possible lever: Do users not see the feature? Do users see but
    not engage with the feature? Do users engage with the feature but drop off after
    a short amount of time?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these can be a direct contributor to the problem at hand and at the
    same time require very different solutions from improvements of the App’s UX and
    design over inventory issues (the audiobooks available in this case) to the recommendations
    presented to users. Again, in this case only the data can tell us what’s really
    going on, so further analysis is required at this step.

- en: 'A possible finding could be: *Users under 25 engage less with the Home Screen,
    the only screen where Audiobooks are promoted, and hence don’t see this feature
    in the App so that usage and engagement are low.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this, increasing the prominence of Audiobooks within the App is a possible
    lever to increase engagement for users under the age of 25\. Keep in mind that
    there are usually multiple levers that are connected to a specific problem, and
    they should be prioritised against each other based on different criteria like
    reach and effort size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a list of concrete, data-based levers teams can work on to solve a particular
    problem is the most valuable outcome of an analysis. The icing on the cake is
    a structured prioritisation of each lever — where do we see the biggest possible
    impact and where should we thus invest first? Sizing levers is an art I will not
    dwell deeper into at this point, however a good prioritisation is key in making
    analysis results even more actionable.

    to tackle the space, we can get tactical and think about concrete product changes
    that can be implemented and tested. This can be part of the analysis and helpful
    to convey specific recommendations, but can also be a next step to take with your
    team our stakeholders (which can be a great way to get buy-in for your ideas).

    increase visibility of the feature within the app: using a banner that promotes
    the feature when opening the app, adding Audiobooks to screens other than the
    Homescreen etc. While there is a significant amount of freedom in designing a
    particular change, the important aspect is that it actually impacts the problem
    at hand we’re trying to solve (in this case, young users not seeing the Audiobook
    feature).'

    Change] will increase younger users’ daily listening time [Problem] because more

    true when we see an increase in young users using Audiobooks, followed by an increase
    in the daily listening time for younger users [Validation Metrics].

    desired outcome in mind. Furthermore, it helps to validate or invalidate an idea:
    If we see no increase in the desired output (increase in listening time) but also
    our lever (usage of audiobooks) did not show any movement, the treatment for the
    experiment might have been a bad choice and we can try something else. If however
    we saw a significant increase in users using Audiobooks (lever) but no effect
    on daily listening time (main problem), the lever is invalidated and we can move
    on to the next one.'

    analyses; it requires a strategic approach to ensure your findings translate into
    actionable changes. By adopting the four-step process from problem statement over
    opportunity areas and levers to experiments, analysts can align their work with
    critical business objectives.

    that next time your stakeholder reviews your analysis, it won’t be a mere acknowledgment
    but a catalyst for meaningful action and positive outcomes for the product and
    the business.
