    among other species. The catalysts behind this intellectual supremacy can be traced
    back to the advent of speech and writing, which facilitated the exchange and accumulation
    of knowledge, collaborative learning, and refined thinking. Drawing from this
    analogy, AI language models seem to be embarking on a similar journey, harnessing
    the power of communication to advance their own form of “intelligence”. In this
    article, I will explore how AI language models are evolving to replicate and surpass
    the remarkable feats of human cognition.

    own intelligence could emerge from an extremely complex coupling of “chains of
    (small) thoughts” that end up generating the vivid impression that we are especially
    “intelligent” while we actually are just barely above average animals in our connection
    with reality —which, by the way, might not even be objective! In other words,
    if AI models are “[stochastic parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot)”,
