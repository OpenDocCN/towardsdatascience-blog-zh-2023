    of available data and their limited ability to use it effectively in decision-making.
    The core of this problem is mainly human-driven. Therefore, there’s a pressing
    need to build [data literacy](/the-might-of-data-literacy-3d91fcc5f46b). If companies
    genuinely aspire to benefit from even a fraction of the data out there, they must

    outside of academia, such as *“cohort”* or *“longitudinal,”* and terms with varied
    interpretations, like *“surveillance,*” can be confusing. Similarly, concepts
    like *“probability”* or *“risk”* could be misunderstood. If these terms are indispensable,
    aim to present them comprehensibly. Avoid getting lost in the weeds of detailed
    arguments, even if they’re meticulously crafted. It’s beneficial to understand

    and consider proper scaling (particularly the vertical axis, which should typically
    start from 0 unless there’s a valid reason not to). Simplify charts by removing
    extraneous elements like frames, gridlines, axis labels, or legends.

    While just 12% of adults globally are numerically literate, the majority struggle
    with data comprehension. Yet, the irony is that many who claim innumeracy show
    proficiency in everyday tasks that demand intricate probability assessments and
    decision-making. **The challenge lies not in their inherent ability but in the
    tools and methods used to convey data.**
  prefs: []

    analogies, strategically using visuals, and employing thoughtful storytelling.
    By grasping the audience’s context and reducing technical jargon, data professionals
    can enhance accessibility.
