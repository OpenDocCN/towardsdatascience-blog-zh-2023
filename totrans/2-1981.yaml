    bit of help from AI, can generate some scientific insights out of data and build
    fancy data visualizations. However, interpreting and selling the meanings behind
    the numbers and graphs is an art. When ChatGPT and generative AI come to the front
    stage, many concerns regarding being replaced by AI emerge. With clear instructions,
    AI can help us generate code, and visualization, and even build well-performing
    models that contain useful insights, but they struggle compelling credible and
    memorable stories based on those insights. They can do science, but art is the
    unique skill humans possess, at least for now.

    While fiction writers may give a more comprehensive answer, essentially, a story
    is a narrative that conveys a series of events with background settings, characters,
    and plots. To make a story interesting, it has to be engaging, intriguing, entertaining,
    or informative to the readers. The data storytelling process starts with defining
    a story that will keep your audience interested by establishing **relatable settings**,
    **compelling characters**, and **intriguing plots**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you find interesting results from data, you need to set a relatable background
    to your receivers before delivering the findings. The settings of the storytelling
    establish the context for the following communication. We first need to know what
    is **the medium** of this communication. Is it a presentation or a written report?
    Is it a deep-dive technical session or a high-level result review? This will direct
    your stories in different directions.

    story, we can briefly introduce the context and the background to ensure everyone
    is on the same page. Then, in Act 2, we delve deeper into the data and findings,
    introducing challenges that your audiences care about or try to solve. Here is
    where you move to the focus of the communication. It could be identifying a surprising
    trend or an important finding. Right away, you represent a breakthrough that tackles
    the challenges, perhaps discovering a hidden pattern that reshapes everyone’s
    perspective. Act 3 is all about resolution, where we present solutions and action
    points. At the end, take a moment to consider the wider impact of our data story,
    leaving our audience with memorable takeaways or required actions. The logic and
    flow behind the communication will define how the audiences receive and react
    to the messages. A memorable story plots ups and downs and audiences resonate
    with these stories because they help them tackle a pain point they face.

    on the scenarios, we can choose among line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, pie
    plots, tables, or just texts. Here are some common use cases in practice:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Line Plot:** Line plots are helpful in displaying how one or more variables
    change over time, making them an excellent choice for visualizing trends and patterns
    in data. A line plot can be used to display a city''s temperature changes over
    a year. This allows viewers to identify any seasonal patterns or temperature trends
    over time easily.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Pie Plot:** Pie charts are a helpful tool for displaying the composition
    or proportions of a dataset or variable. They are particularly effective when
    you want to emphasize the relative size of different components. For instance,
    a pie chart is commonly used to depict the distribution of a household''s monthly
    expenses, including items like rent, utilities, groceries, and entertainment.
    This provides a clear visual representation of where the money is being allocated.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Bar Plot:** Bar plots are ideal for comparing values among categories. A
    pie plot can also show the comparison, but we can add a time horizon to the bar
    plot to extend the comparison over time. For example, we can use a bar plot to
    display the sales across different products for the last five years. In addition,
    bar plots are widely used as histograms that show data distribution.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Scatter Plot:** Scatter plots are helpful in analyzing the relationship and
    correlation between two continuous variables. It can help identify patterns, clusters,
    or outliers in data. For instance, if you want to determine if there is a correlation
    between the changes in sales and price for a particular product over time, a scatter
    plot can visualize the relationship between the two variables.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Tables:** Tables are a valuable tool for presenting detailed data. They are
    particularly effective when viewers need to access specific data points. It''s
    important to note that tables typically display one data dimension, either cross-sectional
    or time series. Cross-sectional tables show value comparisons across subjects,
    while time series tables show one subject''s value comparison over time. A panel
    table that includes both subject and time horizon may be too detailed to present
    verbally but is often used in writing as strong supporting evidence or for more
    in-depth analysis. While tables can be used to show time series comparisons, line
    graphs are typically more effective for this purpose. Thus, we use tables more
    on cross-sectional data.'

    attention.'

    We have professional tools such as Tableau and PowerBI, popular Python packages

    purpose is not to show how advanced code you can write or fancy graphs you can
    generate. Instead, the focus is on getting the message delivered correctly and
    efficiently. If you are more proficient with Excel, then don’t waste a lot of
    time figuring out Python syntax.

    how you should share it. Is it a static graph or screenshot, or do you need to
    allow interactions with the receiver? In addition, is this graph a one-time showcase,
    or do you need to reproduce this graph every so often when the data is updated?
    If you need to reproduce the graph, it is helpful to set up a template or write
    a modular code to save time in the future.

    your findings benefit their business KPIs, and the technical audience cares about
    why you approach this problem this way and whether your model performs well. Depending
    on the time and format, tailor the length of your story based on your audience's

    understand the power of a story when everyone believes it. **Data make us credible,
    but stories make us memorable.** We data scientists need our audience to remember
    us, believe us, and trust us so they will take action willingly. Data storytelling
    is beyond science. It is art. However, it doesn’t mean we cannot improve this
    skill through observing and practicing. Try the 4D framework **“Define, Display,
    Declutter, and Direct”** for your next communication. Don’t forget to comment
    below for the differences you see with this framework or any other suggestions
    you have for data storytelling.
