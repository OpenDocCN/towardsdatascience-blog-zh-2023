    process, including facets like business understanding and stakeholder collaboration,
    I wanted to focus purely on the data science part itself instead. In this article,
    I will provide a template for any data scientist to use and build off of. I assume
    that more mid and senior-level data scientists follow this general pattern already,
    so if you are more junior in seniority, just starting out, or curious about data
    science, this article is for you. That said, let’s dive deeper into the main parts
    of the data science process, including the steps of data exploration, data aggregation,
    feature engineering, and algorithm comparison.

    be updated depending on that for you. The following steps below described are
    the ones after you have already defined the business problem and met with the
    stakeholders. It can also be true that you are responsible for other parts of
    this process too where I define data engineering and data analytics, depending
    on your situation.

    data/features as you would expect starting off with your data science project.
    With that being said, it is important to be mindful of this situation as you start
    your initial data exploration.

    can switch back and forth with the order of *algorithms comparison*, because you
    might find different features are more useful or easier to use for certain algorithms.

    as you can that you understand, and then narrow it down from there. There are
    plenty of ways to compare algorithms like running each one separately, or creating
    a loop that compares all algorithms you’ve selected, but what I have found to
    be the easiest is to use a library that already compares algorithms side-by-side,
    like [Moez Ali](https://medium.com/u/fba05660b60f?source=post_page-----caa83c1e3032--------------------------------)’s

    a few things, depending on your use case, but usually you will want to look at
    the loss function, like MAE or RMSE, for example, for a regression target. You
    can also look at how long the training took and if you needed to add hyperparameter
    tuning, and more.'

    are more and more tools you can utilize to easily compare algorithms, so you can
    spend more time on the one you end up choosing. You can even train and compare
    multiple algorithms in the same time window, optimizing for a specific loss function
    more easily on your training cadence so that you are not set to just one algorithm,
    as your underlying data and assumptions can change.

    comment down below if your experiences are the same or different as a data scientist,
    or what you would expect coming into data science for the first time. Why or why
    not? What other things do you think should be discussed more, including more steps?
    These can certainly be clarified even further, but I hope I was able to shed some
    light on what to expect in a typical data science workflow.
