    on their laptop, typing away ferociously for a few seconds and some important
    event happens? In those scenes (and if they were actually happening), the hackers
    are interacting directly with the computer through textual inputs, as opposed
    to how we usually interact with our phones or laptops through a Graphical User
    Interface (GUI). In this post, we are going to walk through how you too can interact
    with your computer using only text. Odds are that by the end of this post you
    will even find this method to be more efficient than the usual GUI.

- en: Command line interface or CLI is a method of interacting with our computers
    through typing text-based commands into a terminal (or console). This differs
    from the usual Graphical User Interface or GUI that most users are used to. An
    example of a GUI is an iPhone’s iOS that the interface is a graphical one where
    users can tap and swipe to interact with the device. Advanced and technical users
    consider CLI a superior means of interaction with computers since CLI allows a
    more efficient and direct control over the computer.
