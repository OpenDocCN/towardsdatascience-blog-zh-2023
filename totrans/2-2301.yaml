    us a glimpse into the ‘[Metaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAL2JZxpoGY)’
    — a digital universe, accessible through virtual reality headsets, that aims to
    create a convincing sense of physical presence in lifelike virtual environments.
    As a consequence, in 2022, we witnessed a resurgence of interest in virtual reality,
    sparking both excitement and existential dread.

    artificial intelligence. While much of AI and machine learning […] has been hidden
    away from broad public attention up to now, the general online population has
    suddenly been able to engage with large language models (LLMs) via interfaces
    such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. […] This development was accompanied
    by the rise of generative AI for images, with the likes of DALL-E and Midjourney
    leading the pack. […] Some search engines have started to implement this technology.
    […] Like the metaverse, generative AI has the potential to affect every interaction
    we have with digital content and with one another.”

    Over Time**” score that represents the relative popularity or search interest
    for a specific term over a specified period and region. The score is normalized
    and scaled, with 100 representing the peak popularity of the term.

    The scores are relative to the highest point in the time series, and the actual
    search volumes or the number of searches for the term are not disclosed. Additionally,
    Google Trends allows you to compare the search interest of multiple terms within
    the same chart, making it easier to see how their popularity compares over time.

- en: A slopegraph is an effective visualization tool for comparing changes in rankings
    between categories over two points in time. It not only shows how categories rank
    against each other in each period but also how those rankings have changed between
    the two periods.

    of categories or items have evolved.

- en: Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that contains algorithms
    that can create original outputs based on the underlying learned patterns and
    structures within the data. The 2100% surge in generative AI interest followed
    the late 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a publicly accessible chatbot distinguished
    for its advanced language generation capabilities.

- en: The heightened interest in generative AI is reinforced by the positive feedback
    from influential tech leaders. Elon Musk hails it as “the most powerful tool for
    creativity that has ever been created”. Bill Gates envisions it transforming the
    world in unimaginable ways, from everyday conveniences to solving major global
    issues. He claims, “Generative AI has the potential to change the world in ways
    that we can’t even imagine. It has the power to create new ideas, products, and
    services that will make our lives easier, more productive, and more creative.
    It also has the potential to solve some of the world’s biggest problems, such
    as climate change, poverty, and disease.”

    a strong relative position in public interest within the tech sector. Its ability
    to create immersive environments continues to revolutionize fields such as gaming,
    education, and medical training. As we witness the ascent of generative AI, VR’s
    immersive capabilities continue to hold transformative promise, offering unique
    experiences that other technologies cannot replicate. Between VR’s established
    presence and the emerging dominance of generative AI, we can look forward to (or
    nervously anticipate) a multifaceted digital era.

- en: Slopegraphs are ideal for visualizing change over time in multiple data series.
    They excel in situations where you want to emphasize overall trends, such as a
    particular series rising or falling significantly, rather than focusing on the
    variations in each period. This approach reduces visual clutter common in line
    graphs with fluctuating values.
