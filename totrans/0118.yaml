    and even give step-by-step instructions on how to use the part you have contributed;
    take screenshots, and make a video to demonstrate it. If you create an APP, share
    the process you have completed, and make the demo for the unfinished projects.
    You share the process and give value back to the community, and people will follow
    and subscribe to your mailing list. It's the perfect organic traffic!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    often. Influencers have to adopt its rules to favor the algorithm. Owning a domain
    gives you more freedom to apply your rules and pick the best content for your
    readers. If your social media loses traffic, your impact and work will vanish.
    Few people use myspace nowadays, but no one can guarantee how long Facebook or
    Twitter will last. It's safe and cheap to own and maintain a domain rather than
    rely on any social platform for the long term.

    Another option to share is blog hosts like Medium, which includes publications
    like [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) (TDS) with over 600K+
    followers. You can publish your work simultaneously by leveraging Medium's Customize

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The work you showed on the internet can be monetized. Monetization takes time
    and effort to reach. When you start, don't think about monetization. Don't think
    about the number of followers; take less time to brand your posts on multiple
    social media with awesome marketing images. The publication has some rules to
    follow, and it usually takes me less than 3 minutes to grab a free stock image,
    which should be enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most critical thing to focus on is **publishing high-quality content to
    show your work.** Reading more classic books on data and learning what is posted
    on TDS would feed your thoughts as the source. High-quality content serves the
    long-term run as SEO is critical in discovering your work. Writing High-quality
    content for a publication gives your article a shortcut to quicker optimizing

    insight than the Airflow official documentation could. The story became one of
