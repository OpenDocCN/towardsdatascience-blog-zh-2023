- en: When the computer science craze first hit in the early 2000s, many noted that
    computer science would become an integral part of every field. This proved to
    be true. Companies across industries — healthcare, engineering, finance, etc.
    — began to hire software engineers for various forms of work. Students of these
    fields began to learn how to code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would argue the new data science surge takes this a step further. With computer
    science, one could get away with just *hiring* software engineers. A business
    manager or a sales expert did not necessarily need to understand what these folks
    did.
  prefs: []

    ideas that everyone should understand, regardless of official job title. Whether
    you’re a project manager, recruiter, or even a CEO, some level of familiarity
    with these concepts is sure to help you in your work. Furthermore, outside of
    a work context, familiarity with these concepts will give you a sense of data
    literacy that is indispensable for navigating modern society.

- en: Back as an undergraduate, the first data science course I took consisted of
    an immense number of students — nearly 2000\. The course, Foundations of Data
    Science, was one of the most popular on campus, as it was designed to be accessible
    to students across departments. Rather than immediately getting into advanced
    mathematics and programming, it focused on high-level ideas which could impact
    students across fields.

- en: During one of our early lectures, the professor made a statement that has stuck
    with me through the years, coming back whenever I work on anything even remotely
    data related. She was discussing random sampling, a broad term which has to do
    with choosing a subset of a study population in a way that represents the entire
    population. The idea is that studying the subset should enable one to draw conclusions
    about the entire population.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She pointed out that having a good sample was of the utmost importance, since
    no amount of mathematical finagling and fancy techniques could make up for a subset
    that isn’t actually representative of the population one wishes to emulate. In
    making this point, she mentioned that many people assume that if a starting sample
    is bad, then a reasonable solution is to stick with the same approach, but collect
    a larger sample.

    enable you to make sense of many sociopolitical phenomena that folks take for
    granted. Why are presidential polls often inaccurate? What makes a seemingly powerful
    machine learning model fail in the real world? Why do some companies make products
    that never see the light of day?

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This topic is implicit in most courses involving data or statistics, but my
    discussion here is inspired by Alberto Cairo’s emphasis of this point in his excellent
    book, *How Charts Lie*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The premise of Cairo’s book is to outline the various ways in which data visualizations
    can be used to deceive people, both unintentionally and maliciously. In one chapter,
    Cairo expounds upon the challenges of visualizing uncertainty in data, and how
    this in itself can lead to misleading data visualizations.

    note of a crucial point: While in standard English, the term “error” is synonymous
    with “mistake,” this is not the case at all within the realm of statistics.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of statistical error has to do with uncertainty. There will almost
    *always* be some form of error in measurements and models. This is related to
    earlier point about samples. Because you don’t have every data point for a population
    you wish to describe, you will by definition face uncertainty. This is further
    accentuated if you are making predictions about future data points, since they
    do not exist yet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Minimizing and addressing uncertainty is an essential part of statistics and
    data science, but it is far beyond the scope of this article. Here, the primary
    point you should internalize is that just because a statistical finding is given
    to you with a measure of uncertainty does not mean it is mistaken. In fact, this
    is likely an indicator that whoever produced the findings knew what they were
    doing (you should be skeptical of statistical claims made without any reference
    to the level of uncertainty).

    is some kind of magical tool that can accomplish anything. With the advent of
    self-driving cars and realistic virtual assistants but no similar acceleration
    in general data literacy, it is unsurprising that this mindset has developed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, it couldn’t be further from the truth. AI is not magic. It is
    heavily dependent on good data, and its results can actually be quite misleading
    if the underlying data is of poor quality.

- en: I once had a colleague who was assigned to a project in which her task was to
    build a machine learning model for a specific goal. It was meant to classify future
    events into certain categories based on historical data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There was just one problem: She didn’t have any data. Others on the project
    (who, notably, were not familiar with data science) kept insisting that she should
    just make the model even though she didn’t have the data, because machine learning
    is super powerful and this should be doable. They didn’t grasp that their request
    simply wasn’t feasible.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, machine learning is powerful, and yes, we’re getting better at doing cooler
    and better tasks with it. However, as things stand, it’s not just a magic solution
    for everything. You would do well to remember that.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh, if only they knew. Numbers do in fact lie. A lot. In some settings, even
    more often than they tell the truth. But they do not lie because they are actually
    wrong in raw form; they lie because the average person does not know how to *interpret*
    them.
  prefs: []

- en: 'There are countless examples of how numbers can be twisted, manipulated, changed,
    and transformed in order to support the argument one wants to make. To drive the
    point home, here I’ll cover one example of how this can be done: failing to take
    into account underlying population distributions when making blanket statements.'

- en: 'That’s a bit vague on its own, so let’s take a look at an example. Consider
    the following scenario, often posed to medical students:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Suppose a certain disease affects 1 out of every 1000 people in a population.
    There is a test to check if a person has this disease. The test does not produce
    false negatives (that is, anyone who has the disease will test positive), but
    the false positive rate is 5% (there is a 5% chance that a person will test positive
    even if they do not have the disease). Suppose a randomly selected person from
    the population takes the test and tests positive. What is the likelihood that
    they actually have the disease?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a glance, a reasonable answer, given by many folks, is 95%. Some might even
    go so far as to suspect that it isn’t quite mathematically accurate to just use
    the false positive rate to make this determination, but they’d probably still
    guess that the answer is somewhere close.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the correct answer is not 95%, or anywhere near it. The actual
    probability that this randomly selected person has the disease is approximately
    2%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The reason most people are so far off from the correct answer is because while
    they pay attention to the low false positive rate, they fail to take into account
    the underlying prevalence of the disease within the population: Only 1/1000 (or
    0.1%) of people in the population actually have this disease. As a result, that
    false positive rate of 5% actually ends up impacting many individuals because
    so few of them have the disease to begin with. In other words, there are many,
    many opportunities to be a false positive.'

    point: **One could imagine using the scenario above to scare a person into believing
    that they are much more at risk for a disease than they really are. Numbers alone
