    out of school/university were in fields like Project Management, Sales and Marketing.
    When I decided to make the switch to the Data Science in 2020, I had very little
    hands-on experience working with data and didn’t have a technical undergraduate
    degree in a field like Computer Science or Statistics.

    I shared how I addressed this by taking a bunch of online courses, studying for
    a Master’s degree in Data Science, and doing a couple of Data Science internships.

    of data-related skills.

    of the results. Sure, that stuff is super important. But if the prospective employer
    is interested, they’ll ask you in the interview. At this stage, you just need
    a short description which can pique their interest and prompt further discussions
    later on down the line. If you like, you can even include a link to more description
    elsewhere; that’s kind of what I’ve done by including a link to the code underneath
    the project description. But on the main page of your portfolio, you just need
    the high-level details. Anything else is wasting time.

    excellent guide written by [Ivanna Kacewica](https://medium.com/@evanca), who
    used the [Minimal Jekyll theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) for [GitHub
    Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to construct the barebones of the website [5].
    The main reasons I went for this option were (a) it’s free, and (b) it doesn’t
    require you to include ads or the word “wordpress” in the URL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An added bonus of Ivanna’s approach is that it allows you to host your portfolio
    for free on GitHub Pages at the address *username*.github.io, where *username*
    is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. Since your GitHub username
    is included in the URL, it’s super easy for people to find your GitHub account,
    which is useful if you’re got additional projects stored on GitHub.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I won’t go into the details of how to use Ivanna’s theme (as she does an excellent
    job of explaining things), but the basic idea of this approach is that you add
    text and images using Jekyll and markdown. If you’re not familiar with Jekyll,
    it’s a simple framework for building websites that requires no coding or knowledge
    of HTML/web development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Using Jekyll, you build the basic structure of the website, and then using
    markdown you populate the site with your text and images. If you’ve not used markdown
    before, don’t worry — markdown is just a really simple way of formatting text.
    And when I say “simple”, I mean *really simple*: to write a heading, for example,
    you just put a hashtag in front of the text you want to be in your heading. To
    make a bullet point, you just put an asterisk in front of the text you want to
    be in your bulleted list. It’s that easy.'
