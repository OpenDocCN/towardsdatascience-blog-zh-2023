    part](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/back-to-basics-part-uno-linear-regression-cost-function-and-gradient-descent-590dcb3eee46),
    we covered how to use Linear Regression and Cost Function to find the best-fitting
    line for our house prices data. However, we also saw that testing multiple *intercept*
    values can be tedious and inefficient. In this second part, we’ll delve deeper
    into Gradient Descent, a powerful technique that can help us find the perfect
    *intercept* and optimize our model. We’ll explore the math behind it and see how
    it can be applied to our linear regression problem.

    this process is to imagine you are standing at the top of a hill, with a treasure
    chest filled with gold waiting for you in the valley.

    descent helps you navigate the terrain and reach this *optimal* point ***efficiently
