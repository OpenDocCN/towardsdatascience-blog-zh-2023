    capturing the dinner table with an artist‚Äôs persistence and a poet‚Äôs soul, each
    photo a festive vignette brimming with friends, the shimmering glaze of the turkey,
    and the twinkle of ornaments. We meticulously pair every snapshot with an upbeat
    caption, carefully woven from the threads of our thoughts, hoping each post would
    jingle all the way through Instagram‚Äôs bustling holiday traffic.

    Instagram followers, but surely these heartfelt Christmas posts must compel more
    than 5% of our friends to react, right? The problem is, your total follower count
    is not the same as your ‚Äútrue audience size‚Äù ‚Äî the number of connections that
    *are active* and see your posts. You may have many followers, but the majority
    may not be active, or they may have too dense a follow graph that your posts realistically
    never reach them.

    receive 40 likes. You know your audience is somewhere between 40 and 300\. If
    you have supreme confidence in your ability to craft Instagram posts, you may
    suppose your reaction rate be 100%, your audience a mere 40 users and it was Instagram
    who squeeze your reach.

    you think. Maybe you did reach your full 300 followers but you can only get 5%
    of them to gingerly give you a virtual moral support. There‚Äôs no way to know with
    one post. But if you have *two* posts, you can get a good idea, even if you don‚Äôt
    know how compelling each individual posts are.

    who like both posts). We can naively calculate our true audience size using the
    good old Set Intersection theory, knowing that it is very conservative estimation,
    because we potentially neglect a population that doesn‚Äôt like either of the Instagram
    posts.

- en: Let‚Äôs say we know our social media reach to be 100 and we have 2 Instagram posts
    with the probability of like ***p1*** and ***p2***, respectively. We can simulate
    different scenarios of ***p1*** and ***p2***, observe the number of likes on each
    posts, then reapply the naive Method and the Lincoln methods to see how far each
    of them are from arriving at the value of 100 (ground truth).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see that at different values of ***p1***, ***p2***, the Lincoln estimates
    remain ***unbiased*** (the mean of the 10,000 simulations approximate the true
    population of 100), while the 95% confidence interval reduces as ***p1***, ***p2***
    approximate 1\. This makes sense i.e. if we are confident that the like rate of
    our posts is close to 100%, we should be fairly confident about our audience size
    estimate. The naive estimate, unfortunately, underestimates our social reach by
    a lot.

    any population size where is impractical to count every individual is very popular
    in ecology, under a commonly known name **mark-recapture method.** It is also
    common to see this method in action in Tech companies, where we want to estimate
    the amount of bugs in a video game before release, or the amount of policy-violated
    contents in a social media platform.

    in London. It would have been a fun weekend activity to do some sampling in Trafalgar
    Square, interviewing people and crunching numbers according to the Lincoln estimate.
    Although I suspect that the City fans are so few you may actually be able to just
    count them all!
