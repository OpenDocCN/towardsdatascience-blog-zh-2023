  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Data skills can come in many forms. From Data Engineering, Analysis to Data
    Science & Visualisation. However, they all have a common goal: to drive business
    value. This means the answer to the skills-related question is more value-driven
    than technical.'

- en: So, let's explore four ways to improve data skills this year.
  prefs: []

- en: 1\. Finding the Root Cause of Data Problems
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are always Data Problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether that is quality, infrastructure or performance. Your organisation will
    face many Data Problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is imperative to have analytical skills to pinpoint issues in the data lifecycle.
    Recently, the reporting of the executive metrics had been delayed in an organisation.
    The IT team took the major brunt for delayed data delivery, where the delay was
    due to a core logic change in how the metric was developed. Things are only sometimes
    as they seem. Hence, having analytical skills to ask the right questions is essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finding the root cause of Data Problems quickly and efficiently is an important
    skill. Analysing your organisation's top ten latest data problems can help you
    level up this skill. Once the problem is resolved, people generally move on; if
    you spend the time to understand it, you can be effective on the next one.
  prefs: []

    steps.

    well enough — Richard Feynman.*'

    However, only a few people can explain concepts jargon-free to the broader business.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being a good storyteller is an underrated skill in the Data industry. In my
    early days, I remember always struggling to be succinct when providing updates
    on my work. In reality, not many people care about the details; they want the
    TL;DR version. Learn to boil down topics, use analogies and avoid jargon. If the
    message doesn't land, tweak it and try again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Good storytelling helps you land the message, keeps the listener engaged and
    builds credibility. Distil your work into simple concepts/analogies and rehearse
    the delivery. This is how you level up your storytelling skills.

- en: If the data doesn't solve a business problem, it is useless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Data knowledge workers, we spend a lot of time on moving priorities. However,
    the bigger picture about how the activity moves the needle often needs to be noticed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linking your day-to-day work to an end business objective is an under-appreciated
    skill. We had a team of analysts who spent four weeks finding the root cause of
    a Data quality issue, only to find that the resolution had zero business impact.
    It was great to resolve the issue for some inane technical challenge. But it did
    not improve customer experience or mitigate any business risks. If it doesn't
    help a business objective, why is it important?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is imperative to keep the business objective in mind to avoid the above scenario.
    Always ask "why" until you are satisfied that this is a core problem. If you are
    not satisfied, ask "why" again.

- en: We all spend too much time firefighting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firefighting makes you a great tactical thinker. However, you lose the strategic
    objectives and future-proofing thought process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A resolution to a Data Problem could be quick but tactical or long but strategic.
    Nine times out of ten, the tactical will be chosen to stop the bleeding; I have
    done this myself. But months later, the strategic resolution that was not put
    in place will come back to bite. Think of the long-term impact of your proposed
    outcomes. Otherwise, you are simply putting out the fire to light a bigger one
    in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of your seniority in an organisation, thinking strategically gives
    you an edge. Question whether what I am about to implement, present, remediate,
    write etc., will have a longer-term impact on the business and your credibility.
    If it is, look for alternatives.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, you need to know SQL and Python and the Visualisation tool of choice and..
    and.. but these are a means to an end or just an enabler. The technology landscape
    keeps evolving, but these soft skills will be timeless. Prioritise them to level
    up your skills.
