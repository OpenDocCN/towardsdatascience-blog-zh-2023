    data science problems. They are absolutely necessary to build a solution. But,
    remember, it is just not enough. To come up with an efficient solution, one needs
    to learn the art of problem-solving. There are many courses to teach about the
    tools and technology in data science. There aren’t many courses on how to solve
    a data science problem.

    the key aspects of solving a data science problem. We will also see how these
    would assist in identifying and solving the core business problem. Also, how they
    assist in avoiding common pitfalls that lead to issues.

- en: The first and foremost objective should be to clearly define the problem. Problems
    such as customer churn can be very tricky. Generally, when a customer stops using
    a product or a service they are considered churned. In the case of telecommunications,
    we could simply settle for customers who have moved to a competitor or discontinued
    as customers churned. There could be scenarios where it might not be straightforward
    to define customer churn, like, for example, in e-commerce. Different e-commerce
    customers could use the platform at different frequencies. So, in this case, extensive
    data analysis is required to accurately define customer churn. Another example
    is, dating sites, how to differentiate people who found a date on the platform
    from someone who quit after a bad experience.

    should be spent to better understand customer behaviour. Having a good understanding
    of customers will help in better problem conceptualization and, hence, better
    solution development. Below are some questions that could help in better understanding
    customer churn.

    to be purpose-driven. Being data-driven we make use of the data in key decision
    making but by being purpose-driven, the intended goals and the purpose is also
    considered. Being purpose-driven ensures that the solutions are aligned with the
    overall objective of the organization.

    need to solve a problem. One of the primary duties of a data scientist is to collect

- en: It is absolutely normal for us to have an opinion on a problem we are solving.
    But care should be taken to ensure that it doesn’t impact the solution we are
    building or the analysis we are performing. Bias could have a very large impact
    not just on the project but also on the organization and its reputation. Below
    are key reasons why bias should be well handled,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To better explain this with an example, let us consider the field of medical
    science. If the models used for diagnosis and treatment decision is biased toward
    a group or a race because of insufficient data while training the model. This
    could lead to inaccurate diagnoses and incorrect treatment decisions. This is
    a classic example of selection bias.

- en: Similarly, let's say a government agency or an organization makes use of historic
    crime data to identify people who are likely to reoffend. The bias in the historical
    data could result in discrimination and injustice to individuals from certain
    groups. Hence, while solving data science problems, it is always important to
    consider bias.

    should be included in relevant sessions. For example, problem conceptualization
    should include brainstorming with the following teams to start with.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All jobs are of great importance and should never be taken lightly. Many data
    science projects involve a lot of data analysis but no model building. People
    who are new to data science jobs generally have a notion that problems that do
    not require model building are not so important. It is very important to understand
    that business doesn’t care about the models being used or the sophisticated algorithms
    implemented. The single most important factor is whether it solves the problem.
    Never consider a job lightly just because it doesn’t involve algorithms!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is very important for a successful career in data science. People will
    always be remembered by their peers for their effort. A strong work ethic and
    willingness to put in the effort are highly valued by employers, and they always
    lead to better career opportunities.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other important thing to keep in mind is to have a “Never Settle” attitude.
    One should never settle for a simple solution. You should always keep looking
    for opportunities to enhance your solution or your approach. Though this is relevant
    to any career, I find it more relevant in a data science career. There will always
    be pressure to deliver a solution. But one should never use them as a reason to
    settle for a simpler solution. There will be cases where some options would require
    more effort, or sometimes they might demand that you learn a new skill. Keeping
    an open mind and having a never settle attitude help a lot with long-term career
    success.
