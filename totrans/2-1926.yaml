  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each table must be understandable to the audience without the need to refer
    to the surrounding text;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All tables must be sequentially numbered with Arabic numerals in the precise
    order in which they are cited in the text;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Align to the left heading and content of columns containing text;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use an appropriate and meaningful number of decimal places. Equalize the number
    of them and align them to the right;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Align column names according to column content. The first letter of each column
    heading should be capitalized;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Design the table so that the data to be compared are contiguous or in close
    proximity to each other;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each table must have a caption or a self-explanatory title;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always include footnotes for additional notes, explaining abbreviations, or
    uncommon definitions;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the table;

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, ask yourself **if your audience needs a table to help them understand
    your story**;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your table contains only one or two columns and very few rows, maybe you
    can present the data in the text;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the data is in the text, don’t replicate it in a table;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tables should not occupy the entire screen (the whole page). On the other hand,
    they should not be so small that they are difficult to read;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The word “Table” should not be abbreviated as is usually the case with “Fig.”
    for figure;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always use the same number of decimal places in each column. Also, do not change
    the unit of measurement in each column;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be cautious when using different background colors in alternating lines (**Zebra
    Stripes**). Their use is often appropriate in large datasets to aid data readability.
    Try to use pastel color palettes;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Try not to use vertical lines for separating columns;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Column headings should not be significantly wider than the widest data in the
    column;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Always remember that Tables **require more processing time than charts**. Give
    your audience the time necessary for comprehension.

    : “You can create a table in Plotly using the *Table* method. In its most basic
    variant, the procedure is to use *fig.add_trace()*, *go.Table,* and two parameters:
    *header* and *cells*. The former, as its name indicates, corresponds to the **header
    of the table** (the first row) whilst *cells* corresponds to the values, numerical
