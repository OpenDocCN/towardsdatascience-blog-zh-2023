    the only one that decided to take action; several million UK residents did. Either
    by increasing recycling efforts, reducing electric and gas usage or purchasing
    electric vehicles. The UK’s public awareness of the effect of climate change contributed
    to the increase in sales of electric vehicles in 2021\. Hence, in 2021 the number
    of electric vehicles sold was over 300,000; this is more than double the amount

    and electricity generation. Fossil fuels power our transportation, electrical
    and technological services, and even domestic items heavily reliant on fossil
    fuels’ energy output. The problem is that the UK is determined to reduce its dependence
    on fossil fuels significantly by 2050\. Hence, the question is how the UK can
    reduce its fossil fuel consumption and move to low-carbon energy sources as an
    alternative. In addition, fossil fuels are a massive contributor to climate change,
    contributing to the rise in warmer global temperatures and extreme weather.”*'

    awareness of the problems caused by the large dependency on fossil fuels and their
    accompanying damage to our environment is the first step to making the national
    UK goal of reducing fossil fuel dependency by 2050\. To reach more people like
    James, we propose a scale-up of the WWF Carbon footprint app to include AI-powered
    functionality that enables services such as energy consumption prediction per
    household based on historical data and predicted energy demands. This scale-up
    initiative will require funding of £100 million and will be delivered to the public
    a year after project approval.”

    purposes. To be clear, the proposed solution references the story to make it easier
    to remember. I’ve included information about the project cost and timeline to
    show that it’s direct. If we wanted, we could easily find flaws in this fictional
    solution that I put together quickly, but what you should take away from this
    is the elements that make up a desirable solution: being memorable and straightforward.'
