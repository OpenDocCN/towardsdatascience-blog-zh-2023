    I wanted to be an adventurer like him. But I hardly pictured myself dropping my
    studies to go solve crimes with the cops. I guess that felt a bit too extreme
    for my taste, and I was kind of hoping not to antagonize the bad guys this early
    in life. So being a Data Scientist felt like the best of both worlds.
