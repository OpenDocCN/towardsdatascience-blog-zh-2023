    family into a suitable home can profoundly [affect their long-term prospects in
    terms of employment, education, and overall well-being](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fapp.3.2.67).
    Many refugees are vulnerable and it‚Äôs important to place them in a safe environment
    where they can start building a new live. Similarly, for foster homes, it‚Äôs essential
    to align their preferences with the refugees they welcome. For instance, if an
    elderly woman desires to care for refugees but ends up hosting a family of five
    men, the situation can be overwhelming. By optimizing the matchmaking process,
    it‚Äôs possible to significantly improve placement outcomes.
