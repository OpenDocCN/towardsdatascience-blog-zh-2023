    involves many things and can get really different from one specialization to another.
    So I’d like to briefly dissect the data science role into some of its different
    types.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    everyone tends to make their own. I found one on the Internet that works well
    for what I want to share so that’s the one I’ll be using [1].
  prefs: []

    respective responsibilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    some of the roles there as real data scientists — roles such as **data analyst**,
    **data engineer**, **business analyst**…
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the end, there doesn’t seem to be a clear consensus on what a data scientist
    is!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I think the list is actually helpful to let people see what each role is
    about. It should help newbies find their goals and move toward that direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever you choose, the chore requirements are always the same. Let’s go over
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Master Python (or R)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is the most-used language for data science. That’s the main reason why
    you need to master it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could choose other languages such as R or Rust — this last one becoming
    really famous lately — but I’d choose to learn them as a second language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like we have a mother language that we use every day but we learn a second
    one to increase our options and set of tools. Make Python your mother language,
    and then complement your skills with R, Rust, or any option you’re interested
    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on my personal experience, this is the greatest asset on today’s list.
    Python is always the main language I’ve used both in personal projects and professionally
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, I once built a data science project that I called Netty — the one
    I’m most proud of — that consisted on a deep neural network with convolutional
    layers and fancy stuff that worked really well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All Netty did was predict the winner of a given NBA game. Not to brag, but I
    tested it daily throughout two entire seasons and it worked quite well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It didn’t make any sense to build Netty using a language that wasn’t Python.
    It would have been otherwise more difficult, less efficient in terms of time invested,
    and the results would have probably been worse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So don’t ignore me now. Go ahead and learn Python, the ROI it’ll yield is priceless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if you hate Python or just don’t want to follow that path, I’d suggest
    R. It’s an exceptionally useful language for data science and data analysis, so
    it’s a good option as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plus, in most job offers they ask for Python OR R, so mastering one of both
    will probably be fine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Once You Master the Language, Master Its Libraries
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knowing how to make for loops and conditional statements is basic, but that’s
    not going to make you stand out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to master the libraries and packages that make Python and R so useful
    for data-related tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Focusing on Python, because that’s what I usually recommend, here are the musts:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**NumPy** — Your friend for any scientific computing you’re willing to perform.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** — You’ll want to visualize data and these two
    let you do just that.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Keras**, **TensorFlow**, or **Scikit-learn** — These will let you build the
    AI and ML models.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from those, we could also talk about Collections, Statistics, Plotly,
    Dash, SciPy… But I wouldn’t say they are a must or, at least, as important as
    the previous ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I were to start all over again, I’d focus on Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn first.
    Once I became fluid with those and could manipulate data, I’d move on to build
    some models with Keras, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I’m sure you’ve already heard before, data scientists are estimated to be
    spending 80% of their time retrieving, cleaning and manipulating data, while the
    remaining 20% is all the modeling part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s why Pandas is crucial, in my opinion. I’ve been using it daily for some
    years now and it’s versatility, combined with NumPy, is what’s helped me develop
    amazing skills and advanced projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping up with Netty, remember I said it consisted on a neural network. How
    do you think I made it possible? All the cleaning and manipulation of the data
    was done thanks to Pandas and NumPy; I obviously needed visualizations so I combined
    both Matplotlib and Seaborn. And of course, the cool part, the AI model, was built
    mainly using Keras but also Tensorflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like it made sense to use Python and no other language, same with these
    libraries. It’s just as if they all came as a pack.
  prefs: []

- en: 3\. Master SQL as well
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though SQL won’t help you build models and predictive systems, learning
    how to perform queries and retrieve data from databases is basic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve said before that most of my coding time is in Python… The remaining is
    on SQL.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be it professionally or in personal projects, if the data is stored in databases
    – and it usually is – you’ll have to know how to retrieve the exact data that
    you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wouldn’t have been hired at my current job if I didn’t know SQL. And honestly,
    I couldn’t work there if I didn’t master it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So pick any Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) you like and go ahead
    and learn to perform simple queries. I wouldn’t go super deep into SQL, I believe
    that the basic statements should be more than enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them.

    This one basically stored Amazon’s data on a local DuckDB database and I used
    it to track prices of products I was interested in and see when they dropped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    simple in fact, but they were key. I had to retrieve the products’ prices, the
    URLs… All frequently to compare with real time data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Mastering math is key to understanding what you’re doing and making informed decisions.
  prefs: []

    than learned, I know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, gradient descent is the most-used algorithm when it comes to the
    training of neural networks — yes, I used it on Netty too. Gradient descent is
    basically the process of using the gradient (derivatives) to tune the parameters
    that make up the model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another example I’ve used myself at some projects, especially in Netty, is
    on the exploration phase of the analysis. Lots of stats have to be applied there:
    distributions, means, percentiles, deviations… You have to understand these.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Improve Your Visualizations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It will depend on your role but, as a data scientist, you’ll probably need to
    share the insights with someone on your team or stakeholder. Visualizations will
    come in handy so that’s why it’d be a great asset if you mastered them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or Tableau or just stick to Python and build amazing interactive dashboards with
    Plotly and Dash.
  prefs: []

    stakeholders to understand what I’m talking about.

    needed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I tinkered with lots of numbers. One could really get lost easily and don’t understand
    what one’s seeing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With simple visualizations all the data made sense. I could now see how the
    accuracy of the model and its error evolved over time during the training phases.
    Not only that, but I could also see how the winners were distributed (~60% of
    the time the winner was the home team) and lots of new data that was extremely
    valuable.
