- en: For the last ~12 months I’ve been working as a Data Scientist at a startup in
    the health-tech space. I joined as one of two Data Scientists on the team, which
    essentially meant we needed to be full-stack engineers and scientists to get the
    work done and build scalable systems that set the company up for success in the
    future.

    and this piece showcases three main ideologies that summarize my experience best
    so far.

    worlds that are often at odds with one another. This aspect of the job can be
    really difficult to shine in, as it often involves you to be a lot more than most
    other roles ask of you. But for those hungry for an intensely rewarding learning
    experience, it’s unbeatable.

- en: How much you have to build really depends on how early the startup is and how
    many people are on the Data Science/ML, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis teams.
    Regardless, it’ll likely come down on you to not only operate the full ML stack
    (data ingestion to deployment) but also to build a platform to make future projects
    better.

- en: Often times this looks like being in meetings with key business stakeholders
    and creating models that directly impact the bottom line. This is commonly done
    with most data projects, but there often can be a lot more noise in this type
    of scenario. By definition, you’re working in a space that is trying to do something
    novel or solve a problem in a way that provides greater value to your customers
    than your competitors. This means you’re likely not going to work on traditional
    ML projects doing what everyone’s already doing and you’re definitely not going
    to get the project handed to you; you’ll be in charge of attempting to build something
    new. Whether it’s a novel approach to dataset curation, feature engineering, modeling,
    application of models, or all of the above — you should be trying to innovate
    (while still remaining ethical and within legal constraints, obviously).

- en: The projects usually start with a domain expert who *deeply* understands the
    problem and/or the customers and what they currently need. As the data scientist,
    you have to wade through the laundry list of ideas to scope out which make sense
    in a timely fashion, which need more quality data, and which are long-term goals
    that can be worked for. This takes strategizing with the domain experts so you
    can execute in the right direction. The strategizing here is notably different
    due to the startup nature of the organization, which means we often will need
    to scrape data from trusted sites to augment datasets or need to pair very closely
    with the Data Engineers to build the ETL flows or build the architecture for data
    curation for your idea that currently doesn’t even exist.

- en: Strategizing to build the right thing is immensely harder to do in practice
    because often times you need to take a lot of shots at building the wrong thing
    to get concrete feedback so you can eventually build the right thing. Iteration
    is a central tenet, but a high speed of execution is a religion. You have to be
    able to move faster than you likely have ever been asked before. By nature of
    the velocity, you’re forced to focus on only what truly matters, gather feedback,
    and keep going.

- en: Looking around corners, parsing noise from signals, shipping code each week,
    and constantly responding to feedback are highly valuable traits. It’s often difficult
    to keep in this mode for an extended period of time and so a really tight and
    strong team and crucial for making this work.

    It’s more accurate to say that you want to build in a way so you can go faster
    tomorrow. Velocity is important, but acceleration is imperative. What this essentially
    means for Data Scientists is that you need to come in with 2 rock-solid foundations:
    Python and Statistics. This was always needed in Data Scientists to be hired for
    the job, but the work I’ve needed to do has sometimes looked like pure software
    engineering and sometimes looked like pure statistician work.'

- en: My work initially started with a lot of data engineering type of work — gathering
    quality datasets, setting up ETL flows, curating datasets for downstream analytics
    or modeling, etc. I’m not a Data Engineer by trade though, so this was done to
    the best of my ability to keep the team’s speed up. Immediately after I started
    working on the machine learning work, but operating in Jupyter notebooks only
    each model at a time was a cumbersome approach that wouldn’t accelerate us further.
    The solution was to iteratively build an ML platform so over time each model iteration
    is easier to build and deploy. This work was primarily all software engineering
    type of work and without a strong handle on Python, I don’t think I would’ve stood
    a chance. As I was building this out, the statistician type of work was picking
    up due to needing to read a multitude of research papers that employed various
    ML methods on healthcare data — could we replicate that work? Were there gaps
    they didn’t consider? What techniques could we adopt that they tested? Knowing
    how to read papers and translate them into code quickly became a trait I needed
    to develop.

    this role. Leaning into as many of them as possible was needed for me to deliver
    at the level that was expected of me. And in return, I nearly eradicated my imposter
    syndrome while learning an immense amount along the way. I definitely don’t mean
    to glamorize this either — doing all of this work is probably not the norm of
    the Data Scientist role, but if you find yourself wanting to do this work at a
    startup this is likely what it’ll look like. As the saying goes, “A jack of all
    trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one”

    doing it at a startup is like doing it blindfolded. You often don’t have the cushion
    or safety net of delivering large-scale projects that don’t have any impact other
    than wasted work/time. Everyone’s spread a bit thin and the customer is always
    first, so you need to own projects that fall in your space completely. Hardly
    any of my teammates wait to be told what to work on, they usually see what needs
    to be done and get it done in addition to what’s asked so it’s built right.

- en: Ownership here usually means end-to-end ownership. For a data project, it’s
    from the second data can be curated (from where? how often? how does it need to
    be cleaned? where does it need to be stored? etc.) to data analysis/manipulation
    (what metrics need to be created and how? how should we analyze this data? what
    are relevant patterns to track? etc.) to data modeling (how should this data be
    modeled? what models will work best? what does current literature say? etc.) to
    evaluation and deployment (how do we measure success? what does failure mean?
    where is the model deployed? how can customers access this? etc.). This end-to-end
    thinking doesn’t end with just deployment either because you then need to have
    model monitoring and triggers for retraining. It’s a lot to own and not something
    to be done alone.

    are joining and roles are being defined. You quickly need to create friends that
    will do favors for you so you’re able to drive these projects to completion. Honestly,
    the culture of the company can largely be quantified down to how many people are
    comfortable doing favors for others. If you happen to luck into an organization
    where people are quick to make friends and help you out after a quick Slack meet,
    you better be sure you show deep gratitude. Intelligent people are rare, intelligent
    people with a strong work ethic are ultra rare, and intelligent people with a
    strong work ethic that are always ready to help you are unicorns.

    the org willing to extend themselves to get me across the finish line. And over
    time this creates a deeply resilient and formidable culture. This can be created
    around you by you first being someone who is quick to help others. Instead of
    waiting for someone else to help you, be the first to extend an olive branch for
    nothing else other than seeing a friend succeed. Over time, you’ll build a team
    around you filled with people that won’t let you fail in a way you can’t come
    back from.

    explains why I’ve been a bit away from writing). I’d especially love to talk to
    people with a similar experience or in a similar position and learn from you all.
    I’m sure there are elements of my world that I can improve on and would love to
    know how.
