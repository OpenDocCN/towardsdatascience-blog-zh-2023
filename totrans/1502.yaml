    into insights and help you with storytelling. In this blog post, I will focus
    on Network charts, Heatmaps, and Sankey charts. These charts have the same input,
    but we should keep in mind that they are designed with a specific goal, and the
    interpretability can therefore differ. ***I will describe the differences between
    Network, Heatmap, and the Sankey chart, the applications, and I will demonstrate
    their interpretability with a hands-on example.*** All examples are created in
    Python using the *D3Blocks library*.

    these plots serve as sanity checks and sometimes they end up in presentations
    and form the fundamentals of the story. Especially for the latter case, we aim
    to transform complex information into logical graphical visualizations.

    charts can have similar input, they are designed to describe a specific part of
    the scenery. The input for the three charts requires `***source***`***,*** `***target***`***,
    and*** `***weight***` information. A small example is shown below. It describes
    how the variables (or nodes) are connected and the strength of it. Or in other
    words, Penny is connected with Leonard with strength 5\. The second node name
    is again Penny who is also connected with Amy but the strength is slightly less
    with value 3 and so on.

    are the relationship between `source` and `target`. The relationship between the
    source and target values can be handled directed or undirected by the chart. The
    `weight` values describe the strength of the relationship. Notably, the values
    of *source-target-weight* can also be in the form of a (sparse) adjacency matrix
    for which the columns and indexes are the nodes and the elements with a value
    of > 0 are considered to be an edge. This form is often used for the creation
    of heat maps but it essentially contains the same information. *In the next section,
    I will describe how this information is translated into the charts.*

    heatmaps can provide structured insights. **Disadvantage:** You easily lose track

    charts*** are often used to visualize social media networks, such as Twitter posts
    or Facebook, where nodes represent users and edges represent relationships between
    them. ***Heatmaps*** are used in many applications where the number of data points
    can be large. Examples are stock prices, gene expression data, and climate data
    among others. ***Sankey*** ***charts*** are used to visualize the flow, such as
    for Customer journey data with different stages of the customer journey (e.g.,
    website visit, sign-up, purchase). Another example is Energy flow or supply chain
    flow with different sources and uses of energy or different stages of the supply
    chain (e.g., raw materials, manufacturing, distribution).

    is that the network graph makes it easy to understand the exact relationships
    between the characters. The heatmap on the other hand does show a global view
    of all the relationships, whereas the Sankey chart shows the flow between the
    characters. As an example, in this data set, *John* seems to be an important character
    and has a central point in the network chart and many flows going from and to
    it. You can reproduce the results using the following code blocks:'

    areas of interest. One manner is the pan and zoom functionality which is also
    demonstrated in the d3graph chart. Another way to gain more insights is by breaking
    the network on the strength of the edges using the slider that is automatically
    created. This allows us to understand the relationships between the nodes more
    quickly.

- en: You may have noticed from the previous sections that there may not be one best
    chart for all your use cases. It is often beneficial to use a stacked approach
    that describes the data from different angles and/or depths. As an example, you
    can start using a Heatmap chart to demonstrate the overall weak and strong relationships.
    Then, select a cluster or region of interest and use a network chart to analyze
    the exact relationships in more depth. Finally, you can use a Sankey chart if
    you now need to describe the flow between the nodes and the dependencies.
