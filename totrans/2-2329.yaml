- en: The world of technology and data is ever-growing and so is the need and demand
    for data professionals. Data-related jobs are at the forefront of career websites.
    Data Analyst is a growing career that pays well, has immense value for organizations,
    and promises a balanced body of work across the data lifecycle.

- en: I started working as a healthcare data analyst about two years ago and moved
    my way up to be an analytics and reporting consultant, working with multiple tools
    and platforms that are widely used in my organization. Now, day by day, I pile
    up knowledge on specific products (within my company), striving to excel at it,
    not knowing if these tools and technologies are the ones widely used in the industry
    today. It also makes me wonder sometimes if my skills are still relevant and applicable
    if I set out to look for a new job.

    demand and supply of data analysts in the workforce. With the increasing influx
    of data analysts and similar professionals, I want to be agile and competitive
    (for if nothing more, to at least keep my job), and here’s what I am doing to
    stay relevant and be a cut above the rest.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have made it a point not to limit myself to the day job for professional growth
    and development. Collaborating on projects outside my 9–5 has allowed me to work
    on skills outside my primary job, evolve as a professional and develop my thought
    process to approach a variety of problem statements.

    opportunity, or simply broadening your network. You could , for example—

    a professor from a university (or your alma mater), students in grad school whom
    you can partner with to work on end-to-end projects with a defined outcome.'

    of professionals are great at technical skills but lack in communication skills.
    Presenting or speaking at a community event or a conference is one of the best
    ways to develop an understanding of the audience, making your work palatable for
    people with varied levels of knowledge. You can always start small and progress
    to talking to a larger audience. This will keep you updated and relevant for your
    body of work'

    less time to develop knowledge or skills in a very specific subject area. Say,
    you identified Alteryx as a tool that could do wonders for you and your team and
    you want to have working knowledge, where would you go? The internet is the backbone
    of society today and an online certification can serve just well to do the job.

    programs](https://www.edx.org/micromasters) where you study for a year or less,
    at your own pace, and earn a MicroMasters degree from a reputed school that opens
    doors to the school’s network, study materials, and professors.

    envisioning a solution from an amorphous or large problem statement, and providing
    data-driven actionable insights. It’s like watching a seed you planted over the
    winter turn into a plant over the summer. The process takes time and patience,
    but the results — aaaah!

    people that landed me opportunities and be able to talk to startups in the healthcare
    space primarily and work with them as they build the ground up. For starters,
    here’s how you can set up connections —

- en: As a consultant, you can improve a startup’s lead generation, strategy, risks
    and evaluate aspects as an outsider looking inside, acting as a pivot. With public
    visibility (like Medium blogs), you open the doors for people to find their way
    to you and you never know — that could start exciting conversations to work with
    a unicorn of tomorrow ;)

    is your cue to working with new people, sharing knowledge, listening to novel
    conversations, and trying your hands on new tools and technologies. If not, simply
    be open to network; sit and introduce yourself to projects across your organization
    that you can then benchmark for your team and introduce innovation internally.

    and an ability to recommend data strategies to other teams — it only takes identifying
    people with a body of work you like at your company and a quick message/email.

    (which is now a practice) — document your weeks. Today, I write down my weeks

    the organization and those small notes become extremely valuable even for your
