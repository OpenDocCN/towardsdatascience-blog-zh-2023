    specifically targets a pathogen called *Acinetobacter baumannii* which is nowadays
    resistant to a large number of antibiotics usually employed in hospitals to treat
    infections—what’s called a “multidrug-resistant pathogen”. The new breakthrough

- en: Abaucin not only demonstrates promising characteristics as a potential antibiotic,
    but it also exhibits selective activity against *A. baumannii*, making it a narrow-spectrum
    antibiotic with minimal effects on other bacterial species. This specificity is
    crucial for minimizing disruption to the body’s natural microbiota (bacteria that
    normally live on our skin, guts, etc. and are essential to our well-being), which
    plays a vital role in human health. Even more promising regarding its actual use
    as antibiotic, the study reports that abaucin effectively controls *A. baumannii*
    infections in a mouse wound model, indicating its therapeutic potential.

- en: At the core of the work, a message-passing neural network was trained using
    a dataset of molecules capable (or not) of inhibiting the growth of *A. baumannii.*
    This dataset was itself measured and reported in the same work. Subsequently,
    the trained model was used to make predictions on the Drug Repurposing Hub, a
    comprehensive, annotated resource of FDA-approved compounds, whose purpose is
    to allow studies whereby already approved drugs are repurposed for new treatments.
    Here the focus was on identifying structurally new molecules with activity against
    *A. baumannii*. This process led to the discovery of abaucin as explained above.

- en: The ML model utilized a graph representation of the molecules and iteratively
    exchanged information about chemical environments around atoms through message-passing
    steps. The learned features were combined with fixed molecular features computed
    using RDKit. The datasets used for training and prediction consisted of molecules
    screened for growth inhibition against *A. baumannii*, right within the same work.

- en: Key in the model is how it converts the graph representing the structure of
    each molecule into a continuous vector representation by iteratively exchanging
    local chemical information between adjacent atoms and bonds in a series of message-passing
    steps. By accumulating the vector representations of various local chemical regions,
    the model obtained a comprehensive representation of the entire compound. To augment
    the learned features, fixed molecular features were computed using RDKit, one
    of the most important libraries out there for cheminformatics. The final vector,
    incorporating both learned and computed features, was then used as input for a
    feed-forward neural network trained to predict the antibacterial properties of
    the molecule, as a classifier.

- en: The dataset used for training consisted in the results from a screen of 7,684
    small molecules, evaluating their impact on the growth of *A. baumannii*. The
    screening experiments resulted in 480 molecules classified as ‘active’ and 7,204
    molecules classified as ‘inactive.’ This dataset was utilized to train the above-described
    network as a binary classifier that predicted the activity of structurally new
    molecules. Additionally, the Drug Repurposing Hub, containing 6,680 molecules,
    was employed for further predictions using an ensemble of ten classifiers.

    of chemical structures, and then tools from the RDKit library to interpret these
    SMILES strings and derive the relevant atoms and bonds. This encoding allowed
    the neural network to process and learn from the molecular structures effectively.

    model’s performance was evaluated using tenfold cross-validation, a technique
    where the dataset is divided into ten subsets, and the model is trained and tested
    using different combinations of these subsets. The chemical relationship between
    molecules in the training and prediction datasets was measured using Tanimoto

    related to clinical applications. By leveraging its ability to rapidly analyze
    vast chemical datasets, ML enables researchers to identify molecules with targeted
    antibacterial properties more efficiently. This approach not only accelerates

    the power of artificial intelligence, we may be one step closer to overcoming
    the global challenge of antibiotic resistance.
