    a Data Scientist](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-scientist-938d917370b9)
    looks like. What you may not realize if you’re new here is that *two* Data Scientists
    share this blog, and our work days and roles differ quite a bit. Leah, the author
    of our previous article is a Senior Data Scientist, while I’m (Ray) a Chief Data
    Scientist.

    companies) looks very different from organization to organization. For example,
    many of my peers in similar roles have a team that is dedicated to a specific
    business line or product. In contrast, I run an enterprise-level team that works
    with almost every business line in the entire organization.

    to my peers. My peers may have one client, while I have many. They may get to
    do more data science, while I get to learn about and interface with a variety
    of business areas. All in all, I love my work, and I get a good mix of hard and
    soft skills.

    way, but it is what makes the job a great fit for me. I have a great degree of

    we mentioned that we don’t follow a traditional scrum meeting. Rather than *saying*
    what we did yesterday, we *show* it.
  prefs: []

    or pair programming in my current role. With over a decade of experience, I’ve
    learned a lot of things the hard way. While I could share these lessons with team
    members one-on-one, the rest of the team doesn’t reap the benefits of that knowledge.
    Seeing someone’s work allows us all to react to it and provides an opportunity
    to reinforce best practices, cross-collaborate, and promote a culture of learning.

    by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace. They discuss the concept of “dailies” which is
    a daily meeting where directors give feedback that the entire staff of artists
    can learn from. This allows directors to ensure consistent implementation of their
    style across all team members. One of my favorite parts of these meetings is I
    often learn something new.

    to end, we are designed to collaborate to deliver various data products for every
    business line in our organization. This means we tend to have more specialization
    on our team, but there are generalists as well. The stream-aligned team is frequently
    comprised of generalists, while the other types of teams range from generalist
    to pure specialization.

    while I’m enjoying a chat with the team. I find the fresh air energizes me when
    I return to my desk.

    email to be used for rapid, back-and-forth communication like instant messaging,
    but my goal is to generally attend to each email within 24 hours of it hitting
    my inbox. Rarely, something is truly *that* urgent, but if it is, I can be reached
    via instant message or my phone.

- en: One of my favorite hacks is to disable the sounds and visual notifications that
    play/show when an email arrives in my inbox. This helps me prioritize my time
    and get into a state of flow. I believe you should be in control of your time
    rather than constantly reacting to an incoming stream of messages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let me unveil my inner nerd. After working at my company for a few months,
    I scraped my inbox, analyzed patterns, and configured various rules to handle
    most emails that come through. As a result of this analysis, I’ve found that I
    can effectively address almost all emails by strategically reviewing them only
    twice a day. To avoid getting caught up in the time-consuming vortex of emails,
    I avoid checking my inbox for the rest of the day.
  prefs: []

    followed [Parkinson’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) which
    states that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”
    Switching to concentrated email sessions has allowed me to batch together very
    quick responses to simple emails, similar to stacking a lot of small chores together.
    If I encounter an email that requires my full attention, I will save it for my
    deep work time.

    Setting up individual meetings with Data Scientists outside of my team wouldn’t
    scale well, so instead, I hold office hours.
