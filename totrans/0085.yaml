- en: Machine learning (ML) is not a magic stick that you can touch on all your problems
    and expect a reliable solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Advancements in ML in terms of both accuracy and speed have made us blatantly
    approach any problem with an ML-based solution in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a dangerous mindset, which is likely to produce unprecedented results.
    I can assure you that you do not want unprecedented results in production.

- en: In this article, we will go through 4 questions that need to be addressed before
    considering ML as a solution to your problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. Do you have training data that have similar characteristics or patterns
    with the data for which you want to make predictions?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ML is not magic. It cannot produce without being trained first. Hence, the first
    and foremost requirement in any ML system is data. Before considering if we can
    apply ML to a problem, we need to make sure we have access to data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, the data we will use for training a model needs to have patterns similar
    to the data we want to predict.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say we want to train a model to make movie recommendations on a platform.
    If we train it with data prior to 2000, it is highly likely to fail to make good
    recommendations because people’s taste changes over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases, data does not have any pattern. It follows a pure random process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. Is there a simpler solution?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the problems are so trivial that you don’t need an ML-system to solve
    it. In such cases, simpler solutions should be preferred because it takes relatively
    more time and money to implement the ML-based solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a sales forecasting task and you have two solution candidates. One
    is done by taking the moving average based on preceding days and weeks. The other
    one is an ML model with dozens of features computed using a large amount of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the former provides a good enough solution or is outperformed by the ML model
    by a very small margin, you should probably choose the simpler moving average
    model. Spending extra time and money on the ML-model may not be worth the small
    improvement. Moreover, once you decide to scale, the cost of deploying the ML
    model may increase significantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Is it cost-effective?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is related to the previous point of choosing between a simpler solution
    and a complex ML model. However, in this case, you only have an ML-model as the
    solution to our problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if ML is the only solution, it may not be something you want to embrace.
    You need to pay close attention to monetary rewards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating an ML-system and deploying it into production costs money. If you work
    with large amounts of data, which is typically the case, costs dramatically increase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collecting, storing, and processing data as well as training models on the cloud
    might be a gigantic expense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It comes down to comparing the value ML provides for your business and the cloud
    bill you receive. If you spend thousands of dollars to operate an ML-system on
    the cloud and your business benefits very little from it, then you should probably
    look for a better solution.

- en: 4\. Can you afford mistakes?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you create a state-of-the-art model that performs very well, there will
    be errors. No ML model will be 100% accurate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the question is if you can afford making mistakes. Think about cancer detection
    on X-rays. This is literally a case of vital importance. Would you solely trust
    an ML model on this task?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ML model can be used as a supportive document but cannot be trusted to make
    the final call.
