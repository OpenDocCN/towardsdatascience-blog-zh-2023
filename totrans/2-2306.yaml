    in investigating and understanding relationships between individuals and entities.
    Social network analysis (SNA), is a specific type of link analysis that focuses
    on people and groups and their relationships. We reviewed the basic concepts of
    SNA, including nodes (representing individuals) and edges (representing connections
    between individuals). Then, we discussed how SNA can be used to understand social
    influence, group formation, and information flow using metrics such as degree
    centrality and betweenness centrality using Billy Corgan and his relationship
    to the founding members of Smashing Pumpkins as a simple example.

    will continue to use Python and NetworkX to examine Billy Corgan’s sphere of influence.
    We will also expand Billy Corgan’s network to make it more complex and increase
    our understanding of **degree centrality** and **betweenness centrality**. As
    we work through this example, we will discuss context and how **domain knowledge**
    is essential to maximizing the benefits of social network analysis.

    because they provide the necessary context, theoretical framework, and understanding
    of the social and cultural factors that shape social networks. Without this understanding,
    you risk producing misleading or incorrect findings that fail to accurately capture
    the complexity and nuance of social network data.

    of influence? Let’s start with all of his bandmates from the Smashing Pumpkins,
    current and former.

- en: Using Wikipedia, we can get a fairly reliable list of all the musicians that
    played in the Smashing Pumpkins since 1988\. By the way — did you know that [Billy
    Corgan (briefly) had another band named Zwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwan)
    in the [early aughties](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The+Aughties)?
    Spoiler alert, it did not end well. Let’s make a list of them too.

    between Billy Corgan and each of these band members. We also need to consider
    the relationship between each of the band members and all of the other band members.

    is in a band with Jimmy, Jimmy is also in a band with Billy.

    each list of band members and return all the possible combinations of the pairs.

  prefs: []

    complex than the lower left corner where the members of Zwan are because there
    are fewer members in Zwan.

    and betweenness centrality.

    we calculated the degree centrality and betweenness centrality for Billy Corgan
    and the founding members of the Smashing Pumpkins. To accomplish this, we called
    on two methods in NetworkX, and wrote a simple script to execute them. This time,
    since we have our graph assembled, we can simply input the graph to calculate
    the centrality measures.

    that he has the highest number of connections or collaborations within Smashing
    Pumpkins and Zwan. He is directly connected to every other member of both of the
    bands.

    score of 1.000, suggesting that he, like Billy Corgan, has direct connections
